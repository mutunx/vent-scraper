          "text": "Very old coder here. Wrote COBOL to help Atari add features to a inventory processing system to account for the fact that \"inventory\" intially was items received at the loading dock, fork-lifted to the shipping dock and shipped. So \"inventory\" needed to be booked immediately as sales. Now I dabble mostly with Python and JS/HTML. My memory of the Atari gig was that the most critical part was the CICS code. There was just one guy who knew enough to setup the CICS. If he got hit buy a bus... Well after about a year, the bus would not have mattered. Atari buried millions on unsold carts, and I went from working in a beautiful office complex next to Great America Park, to a windowless basement closet somewhere near Mountain View now making changess because the \"forklift inventory\" version was no longer needed. I know this is a bit off topic, but \"COBOL\" was the into I needed. reply",

The system contained records of all their policies including all the premium factors (e.g. make, model, year of car, parking location, physical address, etc). These premium factors were then fed into a rating engine which would use actuarial tables with custom actuarial defined algorithms to determine premiums. In insurance companies, working out the correct premium is core to everything. Insurance companies can have lots of different products and their competitive edge comes from how well they structure their offerings and determine the correct premiums based on risk factors. One does not simply rewrite such a thing. Couple of things I thought were a bit interesting about the place: - Their single server running Universe Basic (with a hot spare I believe) had 4TB of RAM.\n- While I was used to the devs being the stars of the show at the consulting house I worked at, at insurance companies it’s the actuaries. reply",

          "text": "I think you got most details from the others, but insurance is two basically two different things: Life Insurance is mostly a savings product, and the insurance part protects you if you live too long. Property and casualty insurance protects you from losses, including someone's life, but also houses, cars, etc. The domains are quite different, but they both have specific \"insurance business\" computing that's related to actuarial science or analysis, i.e. the statistics needed to calculate reserves, policies, prices etc. I doubt COBOL is used for any actuarial analysis. I think SAS is still strong, but I suspect R is used now. Maybe Python is used in the more static calculations that are handed over to developers, but the actuaries are typically coding whatever they need when they create their models. The rest is just case management, automating business rules, bookkeeping, payments, and for life insurance also systems for trading securities and funds, and possibly in-house tools for asset management. There isn't really a strong case for COBOL. The only reason COBOL still is used is that the insurance companies where early adopters and saw computing as a way to reduce the administrative overhead. The investments were made at a time when trusting some hippies running UNIX wasn't really on the table, and even less so trusting some nerds and their rickety PCs. They built up a workforce with COBOL devs that also gained quite a lot of business knowledge. The digitalisation created another problem - a lot of the older employees were hired to do simple administrative tasks. Even big corporations aren't totally psychopathic so it actually has taken a long time to shift out the employees, and retrain the remainder for the jobs that got more demanding. Even the employees that didn't really have that much high-value domain-specific knowledge to begin with. So the case for more automation was actually not as strong as it could have been. Even still, although especially life insurance is a totally digital product (damage claims is not), they primarily see IT as a cost centre at heart although they probably claim they do not. This has shaped their systems and they have tended to replace their old systems when they're forced by external factors, as the upsides  - better digital sales, more automated decisions, better trading experience for their customers,etc \nare not as easy to achieve as the more tangible administrative automation cost savings they started out with. Actually, this also applies to banks. You could totally run an insurance company or bank without any mainframes or a single line of COBOL. But the organisations still have COBOL developers and maybe more important an upper management that come from that tradition. reply",

Integrations are mostly file based but we do both call and expose APIs (“regular REST APIs”) as well as consuming from and producing to Kafka among other things. We integrate with both mainframe and distributed systems on prem as well as “internal” systems hosted on cloud. We use Git for source control but have a CI/CD solution that is built in house.

As a result, these legacy systems are often using default passwords, have tons of crazy stuff exposed to the network, and are comprised of custom code written specifically for the business purpose (so the documentation is only as good as what they made). On the other hand, these guys generally write pretty neat, lean code that is quick, reliable, and directly responsive to the business.

Super handy while reading someone's else code, which is like 90% on large projects. 2. Quick refactorings. Often times I see people discuss in lengths what would/could be instead of just go and try it out quickly, seeing all the pros and cons. Many times I proven myself wrong by trying it out and seeing pitfalls I didn't see earlier. 3. Warnings: so many real bugs could've been prevented if developers had seen (or cared about) to IDE showing a warning. Many PR review suggestions are detectable by a proper IDE without wasting reviewer's time. 4. Hotkeys (what the parent comment was talking about) -- speeds up all of that, especially refactorings, freeing dev's brain for thinking of architecture and other problems. I can go on an on. Sometimes it feels like 50%+ of AI usage for coding is to free up fingers, not knowing that they were already mostly free by using static analysis features/hotkeys. reply",

And also having worked at IBM in the past where I sat adjacent to the mainframe support team for Business Services, I totally get it. Mainframes are awesome if you ask me, and in a sense we have been trying to reinvent a lot of its goodness with \"commodity\" x86 hardware. From a technical-cultural perspective it was mostly sulkiness, and a complete and utter lack of embracing the paradigms of distributed computing. Also, like most internal clouds, there were plenty of issues as it was. Initially they just tried to replace mainframe application components 1:1 onto VMs in whatever way and whenever anything was <100% reliable they complained that our cloud was not able to do it. I had to explain in a very harsh way, under a lot of pressure (I believe not hitting the deadline of switching off the mainframes meant renewal for a year at 40 Mil.. or thereabouts) the realities of \"cloud\". The developers I spoke with in that time though, were very much the opposite of the move fast breaking things crowd. Intelligent, but also narrow minded I would say. reply",

Additionally everybody who knew the COBOL side of things was retiring at the same time as she was and she did not want to know what the system would look like in five years. reply",

          "text": "I haven't worked in COBOL, but I've worked with it. This was around 1999, and I was building a system for configuring and ordering custom PC's at a large distribution company. One of the feature requirements was that we display inventory over the various options. (ie: There are 373 20G disks in stock, but only 12 30G disks in stock). The idea was that this would let a customer ordering 200 machines know that they should pick the 20G disk if the wanted it now. The way inventory at this company was done was via two systems. There was a normal SQL database that had access to a daily snapshot of inventory taken from a mainframe that always had the up to date data. With the mainframe taking a while to process queries, we used the less current SQL database for the majority of the UI, but took the time to query the mainframe once a customer was in the shopping cart.  Customers might see a change during the flow, but it would at least let them see the most current data prior to committing to a purchase. The mainframe query itself was implemented by someone else as a COBOL job that produced the required inventory numbers.  From my point of view, it was just a limited sort of query conducted over a specialized JDBC driver. (Not necessarily the weirdest aspect of that design.... for a variety of reasons, we did the UI in ASP/VBScript, the back end using Microsoft's JVM invoked via COM Automation, and the SQL database link was via a dubious use of a JDBC/ODBC bridge to connect to SQL Server. It all worked, but not the most solid architecture.) == My only other mainframe experience was working as an intern for a utility company a few years prior (1991-1992). They used CDC Cyber mainframes to run the power grid, using something like 4MM lines of FORTRAN code. The dispatchers themselves interfaced to the system using consoles with 4 19\" color displays running at 1280x1024. Heady stuff for 1991. (The real time weather radar screen was cool too, in an age before the internet made it common place.) reply",

I was the head of product at Pocket in 2018/19, and ever since I left, I’ve had this itch to build my own version. Mozilla shutting it down finally gave me the excuse I needed. https://savewithfolio.com/ Folio lets you save articles from anywhere, has a lovely reading view, lets you listen to articles with some really nice text-to-speech voices, and access all your saves offline across all of your devices. If you enjoyed Pocket, you'll feel right at home! It’s still early days but all the core features are solid and working well. Pocket imports are available via their API (though it’s been a little flaky lately), and I’m wrapping up file imports from Pocket, Instapaper, Matter, Raindrop, and Readwise so it should be easy to make the switch really soon. Lots of fun stuff planned ahead. I’d love to have you join us if you’re looking for a new home! reply",

Relay is also collaborative, so I frequently clip things, clean them up a bit, and move them into shared folders (like docs pages). I like the feeling of local-first combined with a malleable UX.

Case studies in certain engineering/programming tasks, something I read that I found useful and want to have handy to share with others in the future, project ideas or notes for long-running efforts I pursue and sometimes want a \"bucket to pull from\" for instance. While it's certainly true that I probably _use_ 10-20% of what I bookmark, I don't think it would be possible to realize the same positive outcomes without the 80% that I don't.  (Just last week I was able to braindump a large piles of 'examples/essays I found helpful learning about neural network optimization' to one of my engineers because I'd kept them handy after they helped me.) I should say though, I sense this is a slightly different use case than the \"I want to read this article just to read it\" bookmarks where I know I never will, which is certainly something I've experienced but is a minority case in my life nowadays, so I wanted to vouch for productive scenarios too. reply",

          "text": "I depended heavily on Pocket for over a decade as a free user.  It started to get bogged down with about 20k bookmarks.  I used to spend hours manually tagging saves and the search function never seemed to actually return results.  This time around I wanted a self hosted solution. I looked at Walabag and Shiori before I decided on Karakeep.  I just didn't like the UI of the first two.  I already have an Ollama server and the AI tagging feature of Karakeep is far better than Walabag's, in fact the tag management feature in general is.  And Meilisearch adds a really fast search engine to Karakeep that has allowed me to discover new value to the 16k bookmarks from Pocket after cleaning down from the 20k I exported, it's super impressive. Now the less great news, Karakeep is much newer and less mature than the other options and currently only supports a SQLite backend and I really hope that changes.  The only API for Karakeep goes through its web interface and so I don't think I even could export all my bookmarks.  If the data was stored in a standalone real database like MySQL or PostgreSQL other options would be possible. The AI tagging is AMAZING but it generates a LOT of tags and that makes the tag management screens in Karakeep difficult or impossible to use because they are overwhelmed.  I am looking forward to the next and future releases which aim to help with this. I use the Android app which works really well. Karakeep does make your server into a web crawler and because of the little war on AI LLMs we're experiencing these days an unfortunate number of websites have started to fight all crawling.   Karakeep uses a SingleFile browser extension which allows you to prove you are a human or log in to a website and then capture a page and submit it to Karakeep.  This is a little awkward because you may end up bookmarking something once using the regular Karakeep extension and then see that you didn't get what you want and have to do it again via SingleFile.  I'm hoping that at least a config list will be added so that the regular Karakaap browser extension will automatically invoke SingleFile for websites known to block bots. reply",

          "text": "I stopped using Pocket, Instapaper, and the likes in my ongoing effort to be able to walk out[1] whenever I want/need to. I tried out and still wanted to have something that keeps archives of the content I like to read. That is also largely resolved with Archive.org. So, I end up with just a plain-text of some of the links I want as bookmarks. If they shut down or go away; its fine. I have tested a few similar app. I'm currently happy with a minimal foot-print of Shiori.[2] I tried and liked the UI/UX of Readeck[3] better but it has its own convoluted saving and sharing (public) style and way of working. I didn't want to deal with that. Shiori saves a local copy (my default), and I can read it later. I also default it to public share so I can share with people asking for similar topic and such. It is a single Go binary with support for sqlite3, PostgreSQL, MariaDB and MySQL as its database. Most of the online services such as archivebox.io, raindrop.io, readwise.io, and the plethora of other replacements are cheap enough but I've been long enough on the Internet to know that I have to deal with the loss yet again. Here is an example of Shiori Saved and Shareable article https://read.oinam.com/bookmark/39/content 1. https://brajeshwar.com/2025/can-i-walk-out/ 2. https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori 3. https://readeck.org/en/ reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hi everyone. I'm making an app called HRAM (hand-rolled assembly machine), and I plan to release it this week. But I need some beta testers first. Please send me an email at admin@90s.dev if you're interested. Your feedback will be helpful enough that I'll give you a free license. The app is only for Windows (10 or 11).<p>The app is programmable via Lua and has an assembly library built in, so you can create and run assembly functions at runtime. It has a 320x180 pixel screen that you can manipulate to help you practice assembly. The point of the app is to help learn low level concepts, in the fun environment of making a retro style game. I'm also in the process of adding threading/mutexes/etc also, but that may have to wait post release.<p><i>Very</i> early manual, likely to change dramatically: https://hram.dev/docs.txt<p>Thanks for your time, have a great Sunday!</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Someone requested clarification on another post, so here it is: It's a native Win32 app, with a window of 320x180 pixels, which scales upwards as you resize bigger. By itself the program does nothing except read and run a specific Lua file located in AppData. Drawing to the screen is the main operation of the program. The Lua API has a few built in modules: - \"image\" for dealing with gpu images, which includes the screen - \"lpeg\" so you can write a custom parser - \"asm\" so you can compile and run assembly code from Lua - \"memory\" so you can read and write to real memory addresses It uses real memory: All the APIs, including the assembly you write, can access real memory addresses. So you can write to 0x20000 and read from it, either in Lua or Asm, and it just works. And you get raw pointers as Lua integers that you can pass around, which lets you pass them through assembly and back. The app has a few competing primary purposes: - Learn or practice writing x64 win32 assembly - Learn or practice writing a programming language - Learn or practice writing video games like it's 1979 - Learn or practice writing programs that manage raw memory reply",

LLM inference hasn't been too useful for me for writing code, but it has proven very useful for explaining my coworkers' code to me. Recently I had Gemma3-27B-it explain every Python script and library in a repo with the command: $ find -name '*.py' -print -exec /home/ttk/bin/g3 \"Explain this code in detail:\\n\\n`cat {}`\" \\; | tee explain.txt There were a few files it couldn't figure out without other files, so I ran a second pass with those, giving it the source files it needed to understand source files that used them.  Overall, pretty easy, and highly clarifying. My shell script for wrapping llama.cpp's llama-cli and Gemma3: http://ciar.org/h/g3 That script references this grammar file which forces llama.cpp to infer only ASCII: http://ciar.org/h/ascii.gbnf Cost: electricity I've been meaning to check out Aider and GLM-4, but even if it's all it's cracked up to be, I expect to use it sparingly.  Skills which aren't exercised are lost, and I'd like to keep my programming skills sharp. reply",

Even Claude is only marginally better than Gemini (at coding), and they all suck to the point that I wouldn't trust any of them without reviewing every line. Far better to just pick a tool, get comfortable with it, and not screw around too much. I don't understand people who pay hundreds of dollars a month for multiple tools.

Every day it was the same discussion over again, from someone who didn't bother to do a Google search or look at what was posted the day prior. After a week or so of seeing the same discussion over and over again, I stopped reading the news site. Needless to say, it's important to occasionally have discussions like this. I also think we under-appreciate the amount of moderation that goes on here. Sometimes I look at the \"new\" feed and it is just loaded with lots and lots of nonsense, so I get that someone has to put their finger on the scale to keep the quality up. reply",

The solution is not to divide the community and make people unwelcome, but to provide at least some minimal set of filters and ways to opt out of the hype frenzy. I don't want people to feel unwelcome, but I do wish there was a way to turn the AI firehose off. reply",

After a while things settled down, and all players use the tool in some way or another. Some chess players benefited more from the tool than others. I always analyze my games carefully with an engine after the game. After less than 10 years I managed to get from zero to almost master level. I attribute that to extensive engine analysis I put on my games afterwards. The user needs to know how to use the engine, LLM or chess engine, when it makes sense to use it, what are the shortcomings of the tool and so on. LLMs are game changers, and AI's ability to distinguish the signal from noise is marvelous. Will it be a game changer like it is now for chess, a very narrow game compared to everything else, remains to be seen. reply",

When I first saw this thread earlier today, there were 12 AI-related posts on the front page. Even more oddly, threads unrelated to AI somehow still end up getting hijacked by AI-related comments. I use AI and find it very useful, but I really don’t see the reason to bring it up all the time. Not everything needs to be framed around AI, and constantly forcing it into unrelated discussions just dilutes real conversations. It feels less like enthusiasm and more like obsession.

It is weak because this tool is strongly coupled to the problem: filtering HN. It's an example of the more general problem of people wanting to control what they see. This has existed at least since the classic usenet \"killfiles\", but is an area that, I believe, has been ripe for a comprehensive local solution for some time. OTOH, narrow solutions validate the broader solution, especially if there are a lot of them. Although in that case you invite a ton of \"momentum\" issues with ingrained user bases (and heated advocacy), hopelessly incompatible data models and/or UX models, and so on. It's an interesting world (in the Chinese curse sense) where such tools can be trivially created. It's not clear to me that fitness selection will work to clean up the landscape once it's made. reply",

The value can be a lot more for some people than others: - Utility-wise:\nIf you need to perform at work.. even if having it every day means the coffee nolonger changes from your original no-coffee baseline.. - Social:\nMy girlfriend doesn't really go to the expensive coffee shop because it's worth the 2x marker. It's because she can chat about relationships, have security in her relationships with her friends and they can designate this as an unscheduled-long time to talk through issues - Regulating your emotions\nFor me at least buying something small and pleasant can avoid troughs/peaks. In fact overstressing the financial ratio of cost:price of a product causes these troughs for me. That's also why poorer people often buy small but tasty things, even when it's pricy for them, it regulates their mood up enough to slog through the rest of the 1am shifts with difficulty seeing the future (I have been there...) That's why I'd be wary of having an app pressure you not to buy something. You don't always know the real reasons your body gets you to do things. reply",

          "text": "Utility-wise: I specifically mentioned same amount of coffee so this one is moot. Social: most coffee is consumed for takeaway and on Auto-Pilot. In the usa most starbuckses make 80%! From takeaway and 20% from sit ins (they tried to close some Starbucks locations because of this but the funny part is that sales drop more than the 20%... Probably because people take the \"cost of the store\" into their reasoning why they are spending 7-12$ on a cup of Joe.) -regulating your emotions: if you are in a luxury position that's fine... Being / perceiving / stressing about being poor causes a drop of 8 IQ points. I know/understand what you mean and changing a default always causes stress but the question is always about short term pain vs long term gain...\nNobody likes to change... Being told what to do... The app is not pressuring you - it's making you aware of options / costs that you might not have considered. (Did you know)\nThe thing is that if the app is well made and you trust the maker you know you have a \"friend\" who is looking out for you... Even though you might still ignore him/her (think friends who smoke cigarettes etc...) The brain's main goal is not too think because it tries to preserve energy... Unfortunately the environment is simultaneously safer (we killed all animals that literally can kill us) and more dangerous (our fellow humans who used to stand next to us having our back against the animals are often against our interests now.) The question is always what is a low effort high reward substitute...\nI'd say takeaway coffee is probably one of the best options for a lot of people. The art is just to visualize the profit you're gonna make in the future in the now --- because your brain focuses on the now...\nIf I said to you that if you drink a coffee less every other day you'd \"make\" 4140$ in 5 years would you --- pretty sure for most people in dire financial straits they would... On the other hand not meeting with your friend for brunch once a month might save you more even but a friend is harder to substitute than some sugary beverage... The question is always \"why\" - the \"suffering\" now is always certain (change is painful if it is not perceived as improvement) but by making the future gains big, visual and realistic people (can be) more self motivated. reply",

But assuming it's true, I would also assume that \"anyone\" is somewhat exclusive to people who already understand or have the ability to understand how existing SaaS products work. So that just means every company should have a team of people creating whatever SaaS products they need that week. Except that would create so much unreasonable amount of codes to support that the point would be that coding would simply be a race to build edge case scenarios to account for everything. which is also a huge issue. and so i think that the true skill to have that will offer competitive advantage is people management. alternatively some domain knowledge. since domain knowledge will give you the standpoint to decide what you should be doing. but i think a lot of this is kind of overblown. like you aren't really going to want an AI generated on the fly payments system like Stripe or an HR system like tripletex.

          "text": "Not sure if it's appropriate to post ChatGPT's response here, but I gave the same challenge to o3 and it's response was: ```\n2025-07-20 10:32\nThat’s an exhilarating challenge! But here’s the sober reality: *1. Scale & Surface Area* * *Jira* and *GitLab* each represent well over a decade of engineering effort from dozens‑to‑hundreds of developers, QA, designers, product managers, and SREs.\n* They’re not just web apps—they’re ecosystems: issue tracking, CI/CD pipelines, permissions, integrations, APIs, marketplace extensions, mobile clients, high‑availability clustering, compliance tooling, analytics, and elaborate permission models. *2. Engineering Effort in One Week*\nEven an aggressive “strip‑to‑core‑features” build would demand: | Area                         | Must‑Have Functionality         | Typical Complexity | Realistic Time (solo) |\n| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |\n| Auth & user management       | SSO, 2FA, roles                 | weeks              | 3‑4 weeks             |\n| Issue / Merge request model  | CRUD, workflow, attachments     | months             | 4‑6 weeks             |\n| Git backend or sprint boards | Repo storage or board drag‑drop | months‑years       | 8‑12 weeks            |\n| CI runner orchestration      | Job scheduler, logs, artifacts  | years              | 6‑12 months           |\n| Notifications & webhooks     | Email, Slack, webhooks          | weeks              | 3‑4 weeks             |\n| Security & compliance        | RBAC, audits, CVE patching      | ongoing            | Ongoing               | That’s after *scope‑cutting to the bone*—and still well beyond seven days for even a seasoned full‑stack team. *3. Minimum Viable “Clone”*\nIf the goal is a demo that looks Jira‑ or GitLab‑like and handles the absolute basics (login, create issue, simple Kanban board or Git repo viewer), you’d still need: * *Pre‑built OSS components* (e.g., Focalboard, Gitea, Drone CI)\n* *Glue code* to stitch UI, auth, and database models\n* *DevOps* for cloud deploy, backups, SSL, monitoring\n* *Acceptance tests* so the demo doesn’t fall over during the pitch With a well‑coordinated *5‑7 person tiger team*, an MVP façade might be shown inside a week—but it would be fragile, feature‑poor, and nowhere near production‑ready. *4. What \\$1 million can buy fast* * *Fork & skin* an existing open‑source platform (e.g., Forgejo for GitLab‑like, OpenProject or Plane for Jira‑like).\n* Hire a *dedicated squad* (engineers, designer, DevOps) on a 3‑to‑6‑month crash program to reach parity for the specific subset of features you actually need.\n* Budget for *security audit, uptime SLA, and ongoing maintenance*—because the first release is only the beginning. *5. Suggested Next Steps* 1. *Clarify scope:* Which exact capabilities do you really need on Day 1?\n2. *Select a foundation:* OSS codebase vs. greenfield build.\n3. *Form a team + timeline:* Realistically 12–24 weeks for a hardened v1 with a mid‑sized team.\n4. *Milestones & deliverables:* Demo, beta, public launch, enterprise tier.\n5. *Contingency planning:* Budget for security, scaling, and feature creep. If you’d like, I can help map out a detailed project plan, assemble a tech‑stack recommendation, or break down resourcing and costs. Let me know how you’d like to proceed!\n``` :-) reply",

I m a junior level developer (not entry level though) that has been working on a company that creates systems for banks. A coworker of mine attended a presentation done by the company that focused on a project that would normally be done by a group of 5 people over a span of 6 months, but was done by a single person on merely 6 days through a no-coding / vibe coding platform.<p>This made me worry more than ever for the threat of becoming obsolete on my career due to the evolution of AI. What do you all think here? Is a programming career in legit threat under AI, more than other careers at least? And how long term you estimate the actual threat to be in this case? Lastly, how do you think it would be a good idea for a programmer to move like in order to conform to the new standards, aside ofc from using AI to help with work whenever it makes sense to do so?</p></div>",

Sometimes, though, reading the transcription, I find it hard to figure out which speaker is speaking what. I have to listen to the audio to figure it out.

I think that adding a speaker diarization step might make the transcription easier to understand and analyze.<p>I am looking for Speaker Diarization tools that I can use.

And so (as I referred to a couple comments down) OpenAI and the others are in the Google pre-2006 moment where the products are highly successfully engaging and grabbing our attention, but they haven't quite found the business model that prints money in the way Google Ads do.

          "text": "Yup, but my earlier comment was a bit flippant, so here’s a more in-depth response. It was an answer to the OP’s question about why Gmail search feels broken, and a nod to the previous comment pointing out Google’s core business is selling ads. In that context, Gmail isn’t optimized for superior search. It’s part of a data funnel that enables keyword targeting, ad placement, and behavioral profiling. For me, there’s a deeper product lesson here, but also a signal about how someone thinks. Whether a candidate answers “ads” or “search” or “email” isn’t what really matters. It’s the why behind the answer that matters most. At the end of the day, business models directly shape product decisions. That tension is something every product manager has to navigate because they sit between the business and technical sides of a company. Being able to see and articulate that tradeoff, especially when user needs diverge from monetization incentives, is key to both building effectively and being a successful product manager. More often the business model, like subscriptions, is more tightly connected to the product. User has X problem that product Y solves and the company receives Z dollars in exchange for access. However, there are many examples where the pricing or monetization strategy is not so clearly connected to the feature set, of which google search is a great example. For the record, I don't ask this question to junior PMs. reply",

I keep thinking of writing an IMAP->SQL interface¹ so I can search more manually that way. Or even just mapping to files in a filesystem² so I can find/grep/etc, though the DB option would also allow some more complex searches (search for X in messages that are replies to messages containing Y, for example). -------- [1] Keeping mail on the mail server, but syncing it with a DB. This is more complicated than it would first sound as it will mean decoding MIME and various sub-encodings to extract the plain text so I can properly query it, hence that project is still on my “when hell freezes over so I have enough free time” list. [2] Yeah, maildir and similar storage formats already do this, but there is still the unpacking/decoding issue before being able to directly search the text of many messages. reply",

My primary email is apart of some vast international spam program where the mail servers responsible for sending me spam forge headers, falsify source record information, lie about which downstream service provider is hosting them, etc. It’s really quite interesting, but more so than that, it’s annoying. I pondered my problem for a few days, thinking about what sort of external service I could use to surgically remove these numerous, daily, very specifically identifiable spam emails before I stumbled on a thread on StackOverflow where some people discussed using Google App Scripts to do this very thing. I’d recommend searching the web for that sort of topic. You’ll find that there’s a way to set up an hourly script job that will wipe this spam completely off your mailbox and find some peace. Hope this points you in the right direction. The idea of having to use yet another Google service to fix an existing separate one is such a stupid labyrinthine experience, but at least it beats having to set up a job on a VPS for this. If you had this issue with another mailbox service provider, a VPS approach would probably be necessary, though. reply",

Somebody saved that post and extracted all the links in to the CSV file with their name and karma, and put it on a website(it's not there now).\nI've downloaded that CSV file and slowly went through all 1626 blog links over the last 2 years. I finished just about a week ago. It was quite a journey! Some links I would glance at the homepage and immidiately close, and some I stayed for days - reading all interesting articles from the Archive link. It was a blast! reply",

          "text": "I've been working on something that directly targets this problem: WFGY — a reasoning engine built for RAG on large-scale PDF/Word documents, especially when you're doing deep research, not just shallow QA. Instead of just chunking text and throwing it into an embedding model, WFGY builds a persistent semantic resonance layer — meaning it tracks context through formatting breaks, footnotes, diagram captions, even corrupted OCR sections. The engine applies multiple self-correcting pathways (we call them BBMC and BBPF) so even when parsing is incomplete or wrong, reasoning still holds. That’s crucial if your source materials are academic papers, messy reports, or 1000+ page archives. It’s open source.\nNo tuning.\nWorks with any LLM.\nNo tricks. Backed by the creator of tesseract.js (36k) — who gets why document mess is the real challenge. Check it out: https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY reply",

Wrote COBOL to help Atari add features to a inventory processing system to account for the fact that \"inventory\" intially was items received at the loading dock, fork-lifted to the shipping dock and shipped. So \"inventory\" needed to be booked immediately as sales. Now I dabble mostly with Python and JS/HTML. My memory of the Atari gig was that the most critical part was the CICS code. There was just one guy who knew enough to setup the CICS. If he got hit buy a bus... Well after about a year, the bus would not have mattered. Atari buried millions on unsold carts, and I went from working in a beautiful office complex next to Great America Park, to a windowless basement closet somewhere near Mountain View now making changess because the \"forklift inventory\" version was no longer needed. I know this is a bit off topic, but \"COBOL\" was the into I needed. reply",

The system contained records of all their policies including all the premium factors (e.g. make, model, year of car, parking location, physical address, etc). These premium factors were then fed into a rating engine which would use actuarial tables with custom actuarial defined algorithms to determine premiums. In insurance companies, working out the correct premium is core to everything. Insurance companies can have lots of different products and their competitive edge comes from how well they structure their offerings and determine the correct premiums based on risk factors. One does not simply rewrite such a thing. Couple of things I thought were a bit interesting about the place: - Their single server running Universe Basic (with a hot spare I believe) had 4TB of RAM.\n- While I was used to the devs being the stars of the show at the consulting house I worked at, at insurance companies it’s the actuaries. reply",

          "text": "I think you got most details from the others, but insurance is two basically two different things: Life Insurance is mostly a savings product, and the insurance part protects you if you live too long. Property and casualty insurance protects you from losses, including someone's life, but also houses, cars, etc. The domains are quite different, but they both have specific \"insurance business\" computing that's related to actuarial science or analysis, i.e. the statistics needed to calculate reserves, policies, prices etc. I doubt COBOL is used for any actuarial analysis. I think SAS is still strong, but I suspect R is used now. Maybe Python is used in the more static calculations that are handed over to developers, but the actuaries are typically coding whatever they need when they create their models. The rest is just case management, automating business rules, bookkeeping, payments, and for life insurance also systems for trading securities and funds, and possibly in-house tools for asset management. There isn't really a strong case for COBOL. The only reason COBOL still is used is that the insurance companies where early adopters and saw computing as a way to reduce the administrative overhead. The investments were made at a time when trusting some hippies running UNIX wasn't really on the table, and even less so trusting some nerds and their rickety PCs. They built up a workforce with COBOL devs that also gained quite a lot of business knowledge. The digitalisation created another problem - a lot of the older employees were hired to do simple administrative tasks. Even big corporations aren't totally psychopathic so it actually has taken a long time to shift out the employees, and retrain the remainder for the jobs that got more demanding. Even the employees that didn't really have that much high-value domain-specific knowledge to begin with. So the case for more automation was actually not as strong as it could have been. Even still, although especially life insurance is a totally digital product (damage claims is not), they primarily see IT as a cost centre at heart although they probably claim they do not. This has shaped their systems and they have tended to replace their old systems when they're forced by external factors, as the upsides  - better digital sales, more automated decisions, better trading experience for their customers,etc \nare not as easy to achieve as the more tangible administrative automation cost savings they started out with. Actually, this also applies to banks. You could totally run an insurance company or bank without any mainframes or a single line of COBOL. But the organisations still have COBOL developers and maybe more important an upper management that come from that tradition. reply",

          "text": "I am working as a mainframe developer at a bank, currently within a kind of data warehouse solution. Mainly writing in COBOL and Java (in USS), with some scripting in Rexx for internal ISPF tools. A lot of SQL as well, we use DB2 as our main database. Most of our processes are EOD centric, we run a lot of batch jobs (mainly TSO, very little IMS). Integrations are mostly file based but we do both call and expose APIs (“regular REST APIs”) as well as consuming from and producing to Kafka among other things. We integrate with both mainframe and distributed systems on prem as well as “internal” systems hosted on cloud. We use Git for source control but have a CI/CD solution that is built in house. Quite a lot of other infrastructure is also built in house. I am mid 30s and am on the younger side looking at the mainframe area as a whole at my employer, however in my team we have several developers is in their 20/30s. My background is mainly back- and frontend development on the Microsoft tech stack but I have worked, and do work, with whatever is at hand/required. But mostly stuff like .NET and SQL Server on the backend, and Angular/Vue/React on the front end before this. reply",

They would be able to shave off an insane percentage off expenses (in the form of employees whose job exists for no real reason), but the switching costs would also be immense.

          "text": "Hard disagree. Few points I can easily remember: 1. Navigating the code, e.g easily see all the callers, navigate up/down the call tree requires static code analysis. Super handy while reading someone's else code, which is like 90% on large projects. 2. Quick refactorings. Often times I see people discuss in lengths what would/could be instead of just go and try it out quickly, seeing all the pros and cons. Many times I proven myself wrong by trying it out and seeing pitfalls I didn't see earlier. 3. Warnings: so many real bugs could've been prevented if developers had seen (or cared about) to IDE showing a warning. Many PR review suggestions are detectable by a proper IDE without wasting reviewer's time. 4. Hotkeys (what the parent comment was talking about) -- speeds up all of that, especially refactorings, freeing dev's brain for thinking of architecture and other problems. I can go on an on. Sometimes it feels like 50%+ of AI usage for coding is to free up fingers, not knowing that they were already mostly free by using static analysis features/hotkeys. reply",

And also having worked at IBM in the past where I sat adjacent to the mainframe support team for Business Services, I totally get it. Mainframes are awesome if you ask me, and in a sense we have been trying to reinvent a lot of its goodness with \"commodity\" x86 hardware. From a technical-cultural perspective it was mostly sulkiness, and a complete and utter lack of embracing the paradigms of distributed computing. Also, like most internal clouds, there were plenty of issues as it was. Initially they just tried to replace mainframe application components 1:1 onto VMs in whatever way and whenever anything was <100% reliable they complained that our cloud was not able to do it. I had to explain in a very harsh way, under a lot of pressure (I believe not hitting the deadline of switching off the mainframes meant renewal for a year at 40 Mil.. or thereabouts) the realities of \"cloud\". The developers I spoke with in that time though, were very much the opposite of the move fast breaking things crowd. Intelligent, but also narrow minded I would say. reply",

          "text": "I haven't worked in COBOL, but I've worked with it. This was around 1999, and I was building a system for configuring and ordering custom PC's at a large distribution company. One of the feature requirements was that we display inventory over the various options. (ie: There are 373 20G disks in stock, but only 12 30G disks in stock). The idea was that this would let a customer ordering 200 machines know that they should pick the 20G disk if the wanted it now. The way inventory at this company was done was via two systems. There was a normal SQL database that had access to a daily snapshot of inventory taken from a mainframe that always had the up to date data. With the mainframe taking a while to process queries, we used the less current SQL database for the majority of the UI, but took the time to query the mainframe once a customer was in the shopping cart.  Customers might see a change during the flow, but it would at least let them see the most current data prior to committing to a purchase. The mainframe query itself was implemented by someone else as a COBOL job that produced the required inventory numbers.  From my point of view, it was just a limited sort of query conducted over a specialized JDBC driver. (Not necessarily the weirdest aspect of that design.... for a variety of reasons, we did the UI in ASP/VBScript, the back end using Microsoft's JVM invoked via COM Automation, and the SQL database link was via a dubious use of a JDBC/ODBC bridge to connect to SQL Server. It all worked, but not the most solid architecture.) == My only other mainframe experience was working as an intern for a utility company a few years prior (1991-1992). They used CDC Cyber mainframes to run the power grid, using something like 4MM lines of FORTRAN code. The dispatchers themselves interfaced to the system using consoles with 4 19\" color displays running at 1280x1024. Heady stuff for 1991. (The real time weather radar screen was cool too, in an age before the internet made it common place.) reply",

          "text": "I’ve been working on my own Pocket replacement for the past few months. I was the head of product at Pocket in 2018/19, and ever since I left, I’ve had this itch to build my own version. Mozilla shutting it down finally gave me the excuse I needed. https://savewithfolio.com/ Folio lets you save articles from anywhere, has a lovely reading view, lets you listen to articles with some really nice text-to-speech voices, and access all your saves offline across all of your devices. If you enjoyed Pocket, you'll feel right at home! It’s still early days but all the core features are solid and working well. Pocket imports are available via their API (though it’s been a little flaky lately), and I’m wrapping up file imports from Pocket, Instapaper, Matter, Raindrop, and Readwise so it should be easy to make the switch really soon. Lots of fun stuff planned ahead. I’d love to have you join us if you’re looking for a new home! reply",

Relay is also collaborative, so I frequently clip things, clean them up a bit, and move them into shared folders (like docs pages). I like the feeling of local-first combined with a malleable UX.

Case studies in certain engineering/programming tasks, something I read that I found useful and want to have handy to share with others in the future, project ideas or notes for long-running efforts I pursue and sometimes want a \"bucket to pull from\" for instance. While it's certainly true that I probably _use_ 10-20% of what I bookmark, I don't think it would be possible to realize the same positive outcomes without the 80% that I don't.  (Just last week I was able to braindump a large piles of 'examples/essays I found helpful learning about neural network optimization' to one of my engineers because I'd kept them handy after they helped me.) I should say though, I sense this is a slightly different use case than the \"I want to read this article just to read it\" bookmarks where I know I never will, which is certainly something I've experienced but is a minority case in my life nowadays, so I wanted to vouch for productive scenarios too. reply",

          "text": "I depended heavily on Pocket for over a decade as a free user.  It started to get bogged down with about 20k bookmarks.  I used to spend hours manually tagging saves and the search function never seemed to actually return results.  This time around I wanted a self hosted solution. I looked at Walabag and Shiori before I decided on Karakeep.  I just didn't like the UI of the first two.  I already have an Ollama server and the AI tagging feature of Karakeep is far better than Walabag's, in fact the tag management feature in general is.  And Meilisearch adds a really fast search engine to Karakeep that has allowed me to discover new value to the 16k bookmarks from Pocket after cleaning down from the 20k I exported, it's super impressive. Now the less great news, Karakeep is much newer and less mature than the other options and currently only supports a SQLite backend and I really hope that changes.  The only API for Karakeep goes through its web interface and so I don't think I even could export all my bookmarks.  If the data was stored in a standalone real database like MySQL or PostgreSQL other options would be possible. The AI tagging is AMAZING but it generates a LOT of tags and that makes the tag management screens in Karakeep difficult or impossible to use because they are overwhelmed.  I am looking forward to the next and future releases which aim to help with this. I use the Android app which works really well. Karakeep does make your server into a web crawler and because of the little war on AI LLMs we're experiencing these days an unfortunate number of websites have started to fight all crawling.   Karakeep uses a SingleFile browser extension which allows you to prove you are a human or log in to a website and then capture a page and submit it to Karakeep.  This is a little awkward because you may end up bookmarking something once using the regular Karakeep extension and then see that you didn't get what you want and have to do it again via SingleFile.  I'm hoping that at least a config list will be added so that the regular Karakaap browser extension will automatically invoke SingleFile for websites known to block bots. reply",

          "text": "I stopped using Pocket, Instapaper, and the likes in my ongoing effort to be able to walk out[1] whenever I want/need to. I tried out and still wanted to have something that keeps archives of the content I like to read. That is also largely resolved with Archive.org. So, I end up with just a plain-text of some of the links I want as bookmarks. If they shut down or go away; its fine. I have tested a few similar app. I'm currently happy with a minimal foot-print of Shiori.[2] I tried and liked the UI/UX of Readeck[3] better but it has its own convoluted saving and sharing (public) style and way of working. I didn't want to deal with that. Shiori saves a local copy (my default), and I can read it later. I also default it to public share so I can share with people asking for similar topic and such. It is a single Go binary with support for sqlite3, PostgreSQL, MariaDB and MySQL as its database. Most of the online services such as archivebox.io, raindrop.io, readwise.io, and the plethora of other replacements are cheap enough but I've been long enough on the Internet to know that I have to deal with the loss yet again. Here is an example of Shiori Saved and Shareable article https://read.oinam.com/bookmark/39/content 1. https://brajeshwar.com/2025/can-i-walk-out/ 2. https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori 3. https://readeck.org/en/ reply",

Typically I would either find a warm intro from a past colleague, or I would specifically find someone involved in the hiring pipeline at the company on Linkedin and say \"Hey im so and so, and blah blah blah, im thinking of applying but would love if you could tell me more about the role and the culture before I commit\" From here, so long as you baseline can stand out as a solid engineer and communicator those US only barriers fall down. This is why to someone elses point\n> if they’d hire you, why wouldn’t they hire someone much cheaper. They'd hire someone cheaper certainly, provided they could find a person with identical quality, similar culture, and near PST timezones. Which is a fairly tall order in reality.

Plus, they might be happier with a lower salary in a lower cost of living, especially if the quality of life is boosted by weather/location/food/hot people into foreigners. American salaries likely anchor high though, and you can probably still get a decent amount above locals for the same work. Plus even if you were mid, you'd be mid for the upper tier market.

My shell script for wrapping llama.cpp's llama-cli and Gemma3: http://ciar.org/h/g3 That script references this grammar file which forces llama.cpp to infer only ASCII: http://ciar.org/h/ascii.gbnf Cost: electricity I've been meaning to check out Aider and GLM-4, but even if it's all it's cracked up to be, I expect to use it sparingly.  Skills which aren't exercised are lost, and I'd like to keep my programming skills sharp. reply",

If you want to skimp you can drop one of the GPUs until you're sure you need 48GB VRAM and some of the RAM but you really don't save that much. Just make sure you get a case that can fit multiple full size GPU and a mobo that can support it as well. The slot configurations are pretty bad on the AM5 generation for multi GPU. You'll probably end up with a mobo such as Asus ProArt Also none of this is worth the money because it's simply not possible to run the same kinds of models you pay for online on a standard home system. Things like ChatGPT 4o use more VRAM than you'll ever be able to scrounge up unless your budget is closer to $10,000-25,000+. Think multiple RTX A6000 cards or similar.

To me this seems like the subtext is \"Those people are not welcome here,  they are not like us.   It's not like we have anything against them, we just don't want them ramming it down our throats\" Anyone is free to make a website with whatever content they want,  they can invite people to it and grow your own community.    Directing a community to divide to remove an element you dislike is an attempt to appropriate the established community. reply",

After a week or so of seeing the same discussion over and over again, I stopped reading the news site. Needless to say, it's important to occasionally have discussions like this. I also think we under-appreciate the amount of moderation that goes on here.

          "text": "It must have been somewhat the same when chess engines started to beat human players. The chess community should be fairly divided about the usefulness of such a tool. After a while things settled down, and all players use the tool in some way or another. Some chess players benefited more from the tool than others. I always analyze my games carefully with an engine after the game. After less than 10 years I managed to get from zero to almost master level. I attribute that to extensive engine analysis I put on my games afterwards. The user needs to know how to use the engine, LLM or chess engine, when it makes sense to use it, what are the shortcomings of the tool and so on. LLMs are game changers, and AI's ability to distinguish the signal from noise is marvelous. Will it be a game changer like it is now for chess, a very narrow game compared to everything else, remains to be seen. reply",

There were so many posts about how all the topics are about crypto and how it is annoying. Ultimately, all that noise and the billions of dollars poured into that turned into a meme if we're honest. Most people just buy/flip crypto or hold BTC that they'll sell when they double it after a year. AI in LLM form is at least useful in many ways and in front of millions of people without any rugpulls and other shit, but due to their inherent limitations (doesn't matter how much python it writes and executes, half the time or more its wrong for any actual/meaningful work) I think the hype will settle in the next couple of years. reply",

Since then, they've increased to: - \"show hn\" \"llm\" – 2,417 (+54) - \"show hn\" \"ai\" – 13,376 (+248) - \"show hn\" \"vibe coded\" – 23 (past month) That’s about 6 LLM-related and 27 AI-related posts per day, just in the \"show hn\" category. When I first saw this thread earlier today, there were 12 AI-related posts on the front page. Even more oddly, threads unrelated to AI somehow still end up getting hijacked by AI-related comments. I use AI and find it very useful, but I really don’t see the reason to bring it up all the time. Not everything needs to be framed around AI, and constantly forcing it into unrelated discussions just dilutes real conversations. It feels less like enthusiasm and more like obsession. Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if there is a non-negligible amount of astroturfing going on across HN.

I find I can do that with granular enough subreddits, or the (maybe old) feature in Twitter where you could group people you follow into lists and see multiple \"homepages\". This for me has solved the issue of dividing community, which at the least from a practical level can be tricky. Ive been exploring how to achieve this effect \"on top\" of HN lately, rather than by controlling followers, by popping a very simple AI filter on top that re-ranks it for me, and found it quite satisfying, but not sure what the ultimate value/usecase might be. reply",

It is weak because this tool is strongly coupled to the problem: filtering HN. It's an example of the more general problem of people wanting to control what they see. This has existed at least since the classic usenet \"killfiles\", but is an area that, I believe, has been ripe for a comprehensive local solution for some time. OTOH, narrow solutions validate the broader solution, especially if there are a lot of them. Although in that case you invite a ton of \"momentum\" issues with ingrained user bases (and heated advocacy), hopelessly incompatible data models and/or UX models, and so on. It's an interesting world (in the Chinese curse sense) where such tools can be trivially created.

The graininess and low framerate of the video made it a lot harder to tell that it was AI generated than the usual shiny, high res, oddly smooth AI look. There were only very subtle tells - non-reaction of bystanders in the background, and a physics mistake that was easy to miss in the commotion. We're very close to nearly every video on the internet being worthless as a form of proof. This bothers me a lot more than text generation because typically video is admissible as evidence in the court of law, and especially in the court of public opinion. reply",

They happen because the language model hits a semantic dead-end — a kind of “collapse” where it can't reconcile competing meanings and defaults to whatever sounds fluent. We’re building WFGY, a reasoning system that catches these failure points before they explode. It tracks meaning across documents and across time, even when formatting, structure, or logic goes off the rails. The scariest part?\nLanguage never promised to stay consistent. Most models assume it does.\nWe don’t. Backed by the creator of tesseract.js (36k)\nMore info: https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY reply",

The mass extraction and substitution of art has also caused a lot of unnecessary grief. Instead of AI enabling us to pursue creative work… it’s producing slop and making it harder for newbies to develop their craft. And making a lot of people anxious, fearful, and angry. And finally of course astroturfing, phishing, that kind of thing has in principle become a lot more sophisticated.

The value can be a lot more for some people than others: - Utility-wise:\nIf you need to perform at work.. even if having it every day means the coffee nolonger changes from your original no-coffee baseline.. - Social:\nMy girlfriend doesn't really go to the expensive coffee shop because it's worth the 2x marker. It's because she can chat about relationships, have security in her relationships with her friends and they can designate this as an unscheduled-long time to talk through issues - Regulating your emotions\nFor me at least buying something small and pleasant can avoid troughs/peaks. In fact overstressing the financial ratio of cost:price of a product causes these troughs for me. That's also why poorer people often buy small but tasty things, even when it's pricy for them, it regulates their mood up enough to slog through the rest of the 1am shifts with difficulty seeing the future (I have been there...) That's why I'd be wary of having an app pressure you not to buy something. You don't always know the real reasons your body gets you to do things. reply",

          "text": "Utility-wise: I specifically mentioned same amount of coffee so this one is moot. Social: most coffee is consumed for takeaway and on Auto-Pilot. In the usa most starbuckses make 80%! From takeaway and 20% from sit ins (they tried to close some Starbucks locations because of this but the funny part is that sales drop more than the 20%... Probably because people take the \"cost of the store\" into their reasoning why they are spending 7-12$ on a cup of Joe.) -regulating your emotions: if you are in a luxury position that's fine... Being / perceiving / stressing about being poor causes a drop of 8 IQ points. I know/understand what you mean and changing a default always causes stress but the question is always about short term pain vs long term gain...\nNobody likes to change... Being told what to do... The app is not pressuring you - it's making you aware of options / costs that you might not have considered. (Did you know)\nThe thing is that if the app is well made and you trust the maker you know you have a \"friend\" who is looking out for you... Even though you might still ignore him/her (think friends who smoke cigarettes etc...) The brain's main goal is not too think because it tries to preserve energy... Unfortunately the environment is simultaneously safer (we killed all animals that literally can kill us) and more dangerous (our fellow humans who used to stand next to us having our back against the animals are often against our interests now.) The question is always what is a low effort high reward substitute...\nI'd say takeaway coffee is probably one of the best options for a lot of people. The art is just to visualize the profit you're gonna make in the future in the now --- because your brain focuses on the now...\nIf I said to you that if you drink a coffee less every other day you'd \"make\" 4140$ in 5 years would you --- pretty sure for most people in dire financial straits they would... On the other hand not meeting with your friend for brunch once a month might save you more even but a friend is harder to substitute than some sugary beverage... The question is always \"why\" - the \"suffering\" now is always certain (change is painful if it is not perceived as improvement) but by making the future gains big, visual and realistic people (can be) more self motivated. reply",

          "text": "I have worked in software dev for over 40 years with no degree at all. Mostly self-taught, but I got quite a bit of employer-provided training and mentoring especially early in my career. I got recruited by a big company while in school, put university on hold and never got around to finishing. I'd have a history degree if I had gone back to school -- programming started as an interest and hobby for me, one that took over all of my spare time in high school and college. My kids (two with degrees, one went to a vocational program) all have jobs, but none of them work in tech or software. I can't imagine trying to get a job today as a junior, especially without a STEM degree. Plenty of employers (or freelance customers) will overlook credentials if the candidate has experience and a reputation, but young people fresh out of school don't have any of that. Employers seem completely unwilling to take a chance on young people eager to work and learn. I get the impression that very few employers put any resources into training or mentoring their programmers, instead they want to hire people who exactly match some checklist or \"skill set\" and fob the screening and interviewing off to HR, recruiters, and now AI. reply",

For example scientific research uses conda a lot, but I've rarely seen it used by code devs. People using only python will often have more system wide setup with tools and linters than those mixing different projects. Also you'll see some deprecated in tool use in projects which are older and not worth changing without a good reason. Etc. With that out of the way: mise for managing versions of all the runtimes (asdf is fine too), uv for packages (previously poetry which is ok), mypy type checking for things I make. Otherwise I switch between projects a lot so just use whatever the projects use by default. Deployment tools aren't really language specific (when they are they're rarely good). The editing, it's just Cursor, although I did like the jetbrains IDE previously. But overall - just give things a go. It's usually quite easy to swap those tools as needed. reply",

I think language servers and autocomplete are much more useful for .net (I used to do a lot of C# as a freelancer in college) than they are for python. Personally I just open a REPL and tab around in that if I need it but I do that maybe once a month. Most software is well organized such that you can keep enough of the theory in your head for the default nvim config to work easily. A small FITM model with a ring context like Qwen can help a bit with boilerplate if you really want autocomplete. Python just isn't that verbose. reply",

Codex CLI just feels like a stripped-down version of Claude Code. Claude Code wins for me for one simple reason: I can just pay for a MAX account and not worry about running out of credits or going through my credit card limit. That makes me use the tool twice as much as the others, where I’m constantly watching my credit balance. Cursor wins because it was the first big one, not sure if it has any important advantages over claude code anymore. reply",

The conversation is provided to me in audio format. I am currently using OpenAI Whisper to transcribe and feed the transcription to ChatGPT-4o model through the API for analysis.<p>So far, it's doing a fair job. Sometimes, though, reading the transcription, I find it hard to figure out which speaker is speaking what. I have to listen to the audio to figure it out. I am wondering if ChatGPT-4o would also sometimes find it hard to follow the conversation from the transcription. I think that adding a speaker diarization step might make the transcription easier to understand and analyze.<p>I am looking for Speaker Diarization tools that I can use. I have tried using pyannote speaker-diarization-3.1, but I find it does not work very well. What are some other options that I can look at?</p></p></p></div>",

Wrote COBOL to help Atari add features to a inventory processing system to account for the fact that \"inventory\" intially was items received at the loading dock, fork-lifted to the shipping dock and shipped. So \"inventory\" needed to be booked immediately as sales. Now I dabble mostly with Python and JS/HTML. My memory of the Atari gig was that the most critical part was the CICS code. There was just one guy who knew enough to setup the CICS. If he got hit buy a bus... Well after about a year, the bus would not have mattered. Atari buried millions on unsold carts, and I went from working in a beautiful office complex next to Great America Park, to a windowless basement closet somewhere near Mountain View now making changess because the \"forklift inventory\" version was no longer needed. I know this is a bit off topic, but \"COBOL\" was the into I needed. reply",

The system contained records of all their policies including all the premium factors (e.g. make, model, year of car, parking location, physical address, etc). These premium factors were then fed into a rating engine which would use actuarial tables with custom actuarial defined algorithms to determine premiums. In insurance companies, working out the correct premium is core to everything. Insurance companies can have lots of different products and their competitive edge comes from how well they structure their offerings and determine the correct premiums based on risk factors. One does not simply rewrite such a thing. Couple of things I thought were a bit interesting about the place: - Their single server running Universe Basic (with a hot spare I believe) had 4TB of RAM.\n- While I was used to the devs being the stars of the show at the consulting house I worked at, at insurance companies it’s the actuaries. reply",

          "text": "I think you got most details from the others, but insurance is two basically two different things: Life Insurance is mostly a savings product, and the insurance part protects you if you live too long. Property and casualty insurance protects you from losses, including someone's life, but also houses, cars, etc. The domains are quite different, but they both have specific \"insurance business\" computing that's related to actuarial science or analysis, i.e. the statistics needed to calculate reserves, policies, prices etc. I doubt COBOL is used for any actuarial analysis. I think SAS is still strong, but I suspect R is used now. Maybe Python is used in the more static calculations that are handed over to developers, but the actuaries are typically coding whatever they need when they create their models. The rest is just case management, automating business rules, bookkeeping, payments, and for life insurance also systems for trading securities and funds, and possibly in-house tools for asset management. There isn't really a strong case for COBOL. The only reason COBOL still is used is that the insurance companies where early adopters and saw computing as a way to reduce the administrative overhead. The investments were made at a time when trusting some hippies running UNIX wasn't really on the table, and even less so trusting some nerds and their rickety PCs. They built up a workforce with COBOL devs that also gained quite a lot of business knowledge. The digitalisation created another problem - a lot of the older employees were hired to do simple administrative tasks. Even big corporations aren't totally psychopathic so it actually has taken a long time to shift out the employees, and retrain the remainder for the jobs that got more demanding. Even the employees that didn't really have that much high-value domain-specific knowledge to begin with. So the case for more automation was actually not as strong as it could have been. Even still, although especially life insurance is a totally digital product (damage claims is not), they primarily see IT as a cost centre at heart although they probably claim they do not. This has shaped their systems and they have tended to replace their old systems when they're forced by external factors, as the upsides  - better digital sales, more automated decisions, better trading experience for their customers,etc \nare not as easy to achieve as the more tangible administrative automation cost savings they started out with. Actually, this also applies to banks. You could totally run an insurance company or bank without any mainframes or a single line of COBOL. But the organisations still have COBOL developers and maybe more important an upper management that come from that tradition. reply",

If you're looking for more reading material, I'd suggest the O'Reilly book \"Modern Mainframe Development\" book that covers a range of topics. ( https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/modern-mainframe-d... ) If you're looking for an on-the-job training approach that would enable a career change into the mainframe, Broadcom offers something called the Vitality program ( https://mainframe.broadcom.com/beyondcode/vitality_program ) that runs every year in North America, Europe, and Australia.

Most of our processes are EOD centric, we run a lot of batch jobs (mainly TSO, very little IMS). Integrations are mostly file based but we do both call and expose APIs (“regular REST APIs”) as well as consuming from and producing to Kafka among other things. We integrate with both mainframe and distributed systems on prem as well as “internal” systems hosted on cloud. We use Git for source control but have a CI/CD solution that is built in house. Quite a lot of other infrastructure is also built in house. I am mid 30s and am on the younger side looking at the mainframe area as a whole at my employer, however in my team we have several developers is in their 20/30s. My background is mainly back- and frontend development on the Microsoft tech stack but I have worked, and do work, with whatever is at hand/required.

The latter really isn't a problem since these systems are usually standalone, but the former does become a problem - they often are from a time where this just wasn't something to consider. As a result, these legacy systems are often using default passwords, have tons of crazy stuff exposed to the network, and are comprised of custom code written specifically for the business purpose (so the documentation is only as good as what they made). On the other hand, these guys generally write pretty neat, lean code that is quick, reliable, and directly responsive to the business. The really fun thing is watching the users fly through the keyboard-only screens, sometimes with muscle memory that is faster than the terminal emulator can update - they're literally working ahead of the screens. reply",

Super handy while reading someone's else code, which is like 90% on large projects. 2. Quick refactorings. Often times I see people discuss in lengths what would/could be instead of just go and try it out quickly, seeing all the pros and cons. Many times I proven myself wrong by trying it out and seeing pitfalls I didn't see earlier. 3. Warnings: so many real bugs could've been prevented if developers had seen (or cared about) to IDE showing a warning. Many PR review suggestions are detectable by a proper IDE without wasting reviewer's time. 4. Hotkeys (what the parent comment was talking about) -- speeds up all of that, especially refactorings, freeing dev's brain for thinking of architecture and other problems. I can go on an on. Sometimes it feels like 50%+ of AI usage for coding is to free up fingers, not knowing that they were already mostly free by using static analysis features/hotkeys. reply",

Mainframes are awesome if you ask me, and in a sense we have been trying to reinvent a lot of its goodness with \"commodity\" x86 hardware. From a technical-cultural perspective it was mostly sulkiness, and a complete and utter lack of embracing the paradigms of distributed computing. Also, like most internal clouds, there were plenty of issues as it was. Initially they just tried to replace mainframe application components 1:1 onto VMs in whatever way and whenever anything was <100% reliable they complained that our cloud was not able to do it. I had to explain in a very harsh way, under a lot of pressure (I believe not hitting the deadline of switching off the mainframes meant renewal for a year at 40 Mil.. or thereabouts) the realities of \"cloud\". The developers I spoke with in that time though, were very much the opposite of the move fast breaking things crowd. Intelligent, but also narrow minded I would say. reply",

          "text": "I haven't worked in COBOL, but I've worked with it. This was around 1999, and I was building a system for configuring and ordering custom PC's at a large distribution company. One of the feature requirements was that we display inventory over the various options. (ie: There are 373 20G disks in stock, but only 12 30G disks in stock). The idea was that this would let a customer ordering 200 machines know that they should pick the 20G disk if the wanted it now. The way inventory at this company was done was via two systems. There was a normal SQL database that had access to a daily snapshot of inventory taken from a mainframe that always had the up to date data. With the mainframe taking a while to process queries, we used the less current SQL database for the majority of the UI, but took the time to query the mainframe once a customer was in the shopping cart.  Customers might see a change during the flow, but it would at least let them see the most current data prior to committing to a purchase. The mainframe query itself was implemented by someone else as a COBOL job that produced the required inventory numbers.  From my point of view, it was just a limited sort of query conducted over a specialized JDBC driver. (Not necessarily the weirdest aspect of that design.... for a variety of reasons, we did the UI in ASP/VBScript, the back end using Microsoft's JVM invoked via COM Automation, and the SQL database link was via a dubious use of a JDBC/ODBC bridge to connect to SQL Server. It all worked, but not the most solid architecture.) == My only other mainframe experience was working as an intern for a utility company a few years prior (1991-1992). They used CDC Cyber mainframes to run the power grid, using something like 4MM lines of FORTRAN code. The dispatchers themselves interfaced to the system using consoles with 4 19\" color displays running at 1280x1024. Heady stuff for 1991. (The real time weather radar screen was cool too, in an age before the internet made it common place.) reply",

          "text": "I’ve been working on my own Pocket replacement for the past few months. I was the head of product at Pocket in 2018/19, and ever since I left, I’ve had this itch to build my own version. Mozilla shutting it down finally gave me the excuse I needed. https://savewithfolio.com/ Folio lets you save articles from anywhere, has a lovely reading view, lets you listen to articles with some really nice text-to-speech voices, and access all your saves offline across all of your devices. If you enjoyed Pocket, you'll feel right at home! It’s still early days but all the core features are solid and working well. Pocket imports are available via their API (though it’s been a little flaky lately), and I’m wrapping up file imports from Pocket, Instapaper, Matter, Raindrop, and Readwise so it should be easy to make the switch really soon. Lots of fun stuff planned ahead. I’d love to have you join us if you’re looking for a new home! reply",

Relay is also collaborative, so I frequently clip things, clean them up a bit, and move them into shared folders (like docs pages). I like the feeling of local-first combined with a malleable UX.

Case studies in certain engineering/programming tasks, something I read that I found useful and want to have handy to share with others in the future, project ideas or notes for long-running efforts I pursue and sometimes want a \"bucket to pull from\" for instance. While it's certainly true that I probably _use_ 10-20% of what I bookmark, I don't think it would be possible to realize the same positive outcomes without the 80% that I don't.  (Just last week I was able to braindump a large piles of 'examples/essays I found helpful learning about neural network optimization' to one of my engineers because I'd kept them handy after they helped me.) I should say though, I sense this is a slightly different use case than the \"I want to read this article just to read it\" bookmarks where I know I never will, which is certainly something I've experienced but is a minority case in my life nowadays, so I wanted to vouch for productive scenarios too. reply",

          "text": "I depended heavily on Pocket for over a decade as a free user.  It started to get bogged down with about 20k bookmarks.  I used to spend hours manually tagging saves and the search function never seemed to actually return results.  This time around I wanted a self hosted solution. I looked at Walabag and Shiori before I decided on Karakeep.  I just didn't like the UI of the first two.  I already have an Ollama server and the AI tagging feature of Karakeep is far better than Walabag's, in fact the tag management feature in general is.  And Meilisearch adds a really fast search engine to Karakeep that has allowed me to discover new value to the 16k bookmarks from Pocket after cleaning down from the 20k I exported, it's super impressive. Now the less great news, Karakeep is much newer and less mature than the other options and currently only supports a SQLite backend and I really hope that changes.  The only API for Karakeep goes through its web interface and so I don't think I even could export all my bookmarks.  If the data was stored in a standalone real database like MySQL or PostgreSQL other options would be possible. The AI tagging is AMAZING but it generates a LOT of tags and that makes the tag management screens in Karakeep difficult or impossible to use because they are overwhelmed.  I am looking forward to the next and future releases which aim to help with this. I use the Android app which works really well. Karakeep does make your server into a web crawler and because of the little war on AI LLMs we're experiencing these days an unfortunate number of websites have started to fight all crawling.   Karakeep uses a SingleFile browser extension which allows you to prove you are a human or log in to a website and then capture a page and submit it to Karakeep.  This is a little awkward because you may end up bookmarking something once using the regular Karakeep extension and then see that you didn't get what you want and have to do it again via SingleFile.  I'm hoping that at least a config list will be added so that the regular Karakaap browser extension will automatically invoke SingleFile for websites known to block bots. reply",

          "text": "I stopped using Pocket, Instapaper, and the likes in my ongoing effort to be able to walk out[1] whenever I want/need to. I tried out and still wanted to have something that keeps archives of the content I like to read. That is also largely resolved with Archive.org. So, I end up with just a plain-text of some of the links I want as bookmarks. If they shut down or go away; its fine. I have tested a few similar app. I'm currently happy with a minimal foot-print of Shiori.[2] I tried and liked the UI/UX of Readeck[3] better but it has its own convoluted saving and sharing (public) style and way of working. I didn't want to deal with that. Shiori saves a local copy (my default), and I can read it later. I also default it to public share so I can share with people asking for similar topic and such. It is a single Go binary with support for sqlite3, PostgreSQL, MariaDB and MySQL as its database. Most of the online services such as archivebox.io, raindrop.io, readwise.io, and the plethora of other replacements are cheap enough but I've been long enough on the Internet to know that I have to deal with the loss yet again. Here is an example of Shiori Saved and Shareable article https://read.oinam.com/bookmark/39/content 1. https://brajeshwar.com/2025/can-i-walk-out/ 2. https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori 3. https://readeck.org/en/ reply",

LLM inference hasn't been too useful for me for writing code, but it has proven very useful for explaining my coworkers' code to me.

Overall, pretty easy, and highly clarifying. My shell script for wrapping llama.cpp's llama-cli and Gemma3: http://ciar.org/h/g3 That script references this grammar file which forces llama.cpp to infer only ASCII: http://ciar.org/h/ascii.gbnf Cost: electricity I've been meaning to check out Aider and GLM-4, but even if it's all it's cracked up to be, I expect to use it sparingly.

Then you can get two for $1600, fit them in a full size case, 128GB DDR5 for $300, some Ryzen CPU like the 9900X and a mobo and case and PSU to fill up the rest of the budget. If you want to skimp you can drop one of the GPUs until you're sure you need 48GB VRAM and some of the RAM but you really don't save that much. Just make sure you get a case that can fit multiple full size GPU and a mobo that can support it as well. The slot configurations are pretty bad on the AM5 generation for multi GPU. You'll probably end up with a mobo such as Asus ProArt Also none of this is worth the money because it's simply not possible to run the same kinds of models you pay for online on a standard home system. Things like ChatGPT 4o use more VRAM than you'll ever be able to scrounge up unless your budget is closer to $10,000-25,000+. Think multiple RTX A6000 cards or similar.

Also stalk LinkedIn for employees based in random countries – if they're there, HR probably won't freak out about your Bali Airbnb. AngelList filters for \"worldwide OK\" and We Work Remotely's \"global\" tag are clutch.

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hey HN,<p>I'm in a tough spot and could use some outside perspective, especially from anyone who's navigated startup politics or EU/Dutch employment law.<p>I'm a senior engineer with a background at bigger tech companies in the US. A few months ago, I took a job at a small-ish (around 150 people), fully remote tech startup based in Europe. The pay is good for the EU, though definitely a big step down from my US salary. The main reason for the move was to get a visa and work in Europe, and the project (AI stuff) seemed really exciting.<p>It's been a chaotic ride. The project has been in a constant \"prototyping\" phase, with the product direction pivoting at least 4-5 times since I joined. As the main frontend dev, I've been building and refactoring constantly to keep up. It's been high-pressure, but I thought we were making good progress.<p>Recently, things took a sharp turn. My manager, who is new to management and I report directly to, put me on a formal PIP. This was a total shock, as it was literally the first time he'd ever given me any formal managerial feedback. We've never had a single 1-on-1. The reasons cited in the PIP are subjective things like \"code quality\" and \"seniority.\"<p>The part that feels off is that the \"messy\" code they're pointing to is a direct result of the constant pivots and the \"move fast\" culture we've all been working in. My manager's own PRs have introduced critical bugs that I've had to stay late to fix. It feels less like a real performance issue and more like they needed a scapegoat because the project is under pressure.<p>Now things are escalating. I was recently excluded from a key project Slack channel where launch feedback was being shared. And I just got an automated email asking me to sign a contract amendment that cuts my salary by nearly 20%.<p>I know my contract (permanent, Dutch) gives me strong protections, and I've started pushing back on the procedural flaws with HR, which seems to be working. I'm documenting everything.<p>My question for the HN community is:<p>1) For those who've been in a similar startup PIP situation, what's the real end game here? Is this a genuine attempt to \"improve\" me, or is it just the first step in managing me out?<p>2) Any advice on how to handle the day-to-day emotional drain of working with a manager who you feel is actively trying to undermine you, while still needing to be \"professional\" and collaborative on PRs?<p>3) Are they trying to pressure me into quitting or accepting a lowball settlement offer (VSO)?<p>4) I'm trying to stay strategic and not get emotional, but it's tough when you feel like you're being disrespected.<p>Any advice or shared experiences would be incredibly helpful. Thanks!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Feeling like this is a temp situation will help. 3) 100% yes, they're trying to pressure you into leaving. Try to get the best terms you can. 4) Doesn't sound very \"strategic\" to over-stay somewhere that you call \"day-to-day emotional drain of working with a manager who you feel is actively trying to undermine you.\" You should work on your exit. You're talking about strategy, but realistically what do you imagine is the fairy-tail ending of this one? You get to drag it out painfully for both sides? Best case scenario you get to find a workplace that makes you happy, and let them continue their dysfunctional hell until they burn through all their runway without any actual product to show. reply",

In the meantime, you'll have an employment gap and an employer who plays fast and loose with the law, so they might be willing to do other things like shit talk you during reference checks.

So many threads used to be essentially Cursor vs Windsurf, Cursor alone as a presumed champion, and more recently Claude Code.<p>Basically never hear about Augment Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, etc. which all seem pretty well respected. Or Replit, Bolt which seem to have huge user numbers (not professional devs though which is why I assume they're so under-represented here).</p></div>",

Gemini cli asked for a Cloud project id, no idea what is meant with this. Cursor is not an option because I think long term they can’t compete with the integration that Anthropic can offer.

Mostly self-taught, but I got quite a bit of employer-provided training and mentoring especially early in my career. I got recruited by a big company while in school, put university on hold and never got around to finishing. I'd have a history degree if I had gone back to school -- programming started as an interest and hobby for me, one that took over all of my spare time in high school and college. My kids (two with degrees, one went to a vocational program) all have jobs, but none of them work in tech or software. I can't imagine trying to get a job today as a junior, especially without a STEM degree. Plenty of employers (or freelance customers) will overlook credentials if the candidate has experience and a reputation, but young people fresh out of school don't have any of that. Employers seem completely unwilling to take a chance on young people eager to work and learn. I get the impression that very few employers put any resources into training or mentoring their programmers, instead they want to hire people who exactly match some checklist or \"skill set\" and fob the screening and interviewing off to HR, recruiters, and now AI. reply",

          "text": "I have no degree at all. I’ve been doing software development professionally for around seven years now. Like many, I’ve started programming as a hobby as a child, around 11 or 12. I got pigeonholed quickly into enterprise development, mostly at non tech companies of various sizes. I knew I never wanted to work as a software dev professionally. I had other plans initially that fell through. However I found myself in a situation where my choices were to struggle off of a low skill job or try and break into the industry have a reasonably comfortable life. Of course, even that didn’t work out as expected. I was significantly underpaid (even with local COL/salary data in mind), still at least it was a foot in the door and a full time job. My salary came more in line with what someone would expect in a small city around the time, but still barely at the bottom of that range. Around the time of the COVID glut, I finally landed a six figure job, as well as the closest thing I’ve had to a job ”in tech”. It was pretty decent, but half the company was dumped a year or two later. I didn’t expect to have much of an issue in the market, ignorant of how bad it really was and with the understanding that with my experience I couldn’t be a total pariah. Instead it took over a year to find a new job and that was solely due to nepotism. A little bit into my current job, I realized my career was dead. I don’t keep up with the industry outside my day to day anymore, I’m certainly not keeping up with newer fresher people and to some extend miss that enthusiasm. But it really does not interest me anymore. Rarely the tech and never the product. I’ve thought about leaving before that happens, but I have yet to see a path to something else that I wouldn’t hate just as much. I figure I’ll either die of from stagnation or AI will replace me or lower that value of my work to the point where the money is no longer worth staying reply",

          "text": "I might be an interesting case study here in that I started working in tech when I was 14, didn't start college until I was 22, and ended up with a STEM degree afterwards (Northwestern, electrical engineering). While it was always possible for me to find work before the degree, I have to admit that the work offered was vastly incommensurate with both my actual skill level and my desired compensation. This is much less the case post-degree. In fact I now regularly have to turn down work I frankly feel like I couldn't do as good a job on because I have a language to learn and a citizenship to clinch. I do think this effect would have faded out gradually either way, markets are going to reach equilibrium. But the degree made it happen much faster for me even despite relocating to an entirely foreign job market. I would say get the degree in almost all cases. reply",

          "text": "I'm a self-taught programmer, been coding since I was 12. Went to university for a science degree, but it was my programming skills that ended up being way more useful and lucrative. Worked in various technical roles since I was 18, from data engineering at major research hospital, technical due-diligence for venture capital, startups, ML research, etc. Basically, my degree didn't seem to matter. At the moment, I'm running a program for self-directed CS education[1] and end up talking to a lot of people who were self-taught. Part of the motivation for the program was that we found that people we hired who had a lot of self-directed experiences were much better engineers. It wasn't that degrees were necessarily bad, but it seemed like the thing that made them good was not the degree. From my experience talking to people who were also mostly self-taught, the outcomes are a mixed bag. In retrospect, I think I was quite lucky in that I had the right support structures (mentors, etc) in place throughout my life. Some I worked towards, others kinda fell in my lap. In addition, some of my earlier career/life decisions based on hunches have worked out so far (pivoting from medicine to ML in 2012). Not everyone I talked to had the same experience. Some really languished because they really had no support / positive influences. Others think it's one of the best decisions they've made, in both time/money saved and agency. If I had to summarize, one of the major negatives is that self-directed education frontloads a lot of the problems early on. You're in total control, but also exposed to all your mistakes. If you don't have the right environment, you can flounder in the sense that you don't even know what you're missing. This is compounded by our terrible K-12 education system, which does not prepare you for self-direction. If you don't have other sources of support, it could lead you to a vicious cycle of failure begetting failure. You'll also be \"marked\" [2] and mistakes/setbacks will be attributed to your lack of degree, whether justified or not. From a career perspective, some hiring managers are not incentivized to take risks on non-degree holders. Ie. it could blow back on them if you don't work out. You'll have to work harder on signaling and networking, etc. You're not going \"fit\", esp in a degree-heavy culture, and that could lead to social isolation. The positives is that, at the moment, there's never been a better time to self-direct your education. You end up learning things that interest you, at your pace at the right time, so the problems/work is always relevant. You can go really deep really fast. The people that you want to work for/with don't care about your degree. Self-directed education is inevitable, esp in tech. Every one of us eventually have to take control of our education. The problems you have to work through early on are also inevitable (ex. signaling to others that you are competent). The agency and sense of control is great for your mental well-being and developing accountability. Your team can count on you to take the initiative, figure things out, and learn the things you need to learn. Uncertainty is not paralyzing. You've dealt with it your whole life. Overall, it's not an easy path. I think a lot of it depends on early support and the mental attitude/personality of the individual.

For example scientific research uses conda a lot, but I've rarely seen it used by code devs. People using only python will often have more system wide setup with tools and linters than those mixing different projects. Also you'll see some deprecated in tool use in projects which are older and not worth changing without a good reason. Etc. With that out of the way: mise for managing versions of all the runtimes (asdf is fine too), uv for packages (previously poetry which is ok), mypy type checking for things I make. Otherwise I switch between projects a lot so just use whatever the projects use by default. Deployment tools aren't really language specific (when they are they're rarely good). The editing, it's just Cursor, although I did like the jetbrains IDE previously. But overall - just give things a go. It's usually quite easy to swap those tools as needed. reply",

Instead of working through challenges myself, I find myself just going with whatever it suggests, even when I haven't fully thought the problem through. It's making me mentally lazy.\nThe constant suggestions feel like having someone looking over your shoulder, blurting out answers before you've even finished forming the question. Really breaks your concentration and stops you from developing your own solutions.\nI'm thinking of disabling it for a while, maybe permanently. Don't get me wrong - LLMs are incredibly useful for development work, but only when I deliberately choose to use them. Having them always on feels like it's weakening my ability to think independently.\nCurious what others on HN think about this. Anyone else feeling like these tools are changing how they approach problems?</div>",

And so (as I referred to a couple comments down) OpenAI and the others are in the Google pre-2006 moment where the products are highly successfully engaging and grabbing our attention, but they haven't quite found the business model that prints money in the way Google Ads do.

          "text": "Yup, but my earlier comment was a bit flippant, so here’s a more in-depth response. It was an answer to the OP’s question about why Gmail search feels broken, and a nod to the previous comment pointing out Google’s core business is selling ads. In that context, Gmail isn’t optimized for superior search. It’s part of a data funnel that enables keyword targeting, ad placement, and behavioral profiling. For me, there’s a deeper product lesson here, but also a signal about how someone thinks. Whether a candidate answers “ads” or “search” or “email” isn’t what really matters. It’s the why behind the answer that matters most. At the end of the day, business models directly shape product decisions. That tension is something every product manager has to navigate because they sit between the business and technical sides of a company. Being able to see and articulate that tradeoff, especially when user needs diverge from monetization incentives, is key to both building effectively and being a successful product manager. More often the business model, like subscriptions, is more tightly connected to the product. User has X problem that product Y solves and the company receives Z dollars in exchange for access. However, there are many examples where the pricing or monetization strategy is not so clearly connected to the feature set, of which google search is a great example. For the record, I don't ask this question to junior PMs. reply",

There are two potential reasons: 1) They have a problem with the Unicode-character, which is not that uncommon with foreign-companies, that they miss some details on a local market. 2) Most search-systems have long moved to fuzzy results, with exact search being a more and more flawed option. And this goes even deeper, as they have started to expand search terms, and show you different words with the same or even just similar meaning. And of course, there is also the solution that the search works correct, but just doesn't show you the part where this sign is, like somewhere in the header, hidden in some alternative view or an attachment, or something like that. reply",

My primary email is apart of some vast international spam program where the mail servers responsible for sending me spam forge headers, falsify source record information, lie about which downstream service provider is hosting them, etc. It’s really quite interesting, but more so than that, it’s annoying. I pondered my problem for a few days, thinking about what sort of external service I could use to surgically remove these numerous, daily, very specifically identifiable spam emails before I stumbled on a thread on StackOverflow where some people discussed using Google App Scripts to do this very thing. I’d recommend searching the web for that sort of topic. You’ll find that there’s a way to set up an hourly script job that will wipe this spam completely off your mailbox and find some peace. Hope this points you in the right direction. The idea of having to use yet another Google service to fix an existing separate one is such a stupid labyrinthine experience, but at least it beats having to set up a job on a VPS for this. If you had this issue with another mailbox service provider, a VPS approach would probably be necessary, though. reply",

This is more complicated than it would first sound as it will mean decoding MIME and various sub-encodings to extract the plain text so I can properly query it, hence that project is still on my “when hell freezes over so I have enough free time” list.

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hi,<p>I am making a tool that needs to analyze a conversation (non-English) between two people. The conversation is provided to me in audio format. I am currently using OpenAI Whisper to transcribe and feed the transcription to ChatGPT-4o model through the API for analysis.<p>So far, it's doing a fair job. Sometimes, though, reading the transcription, I find it hard to figure out which speaker is speaking what. I have to listen to the audio to figure it out. I am wondering if ChatGPT-4o would also sometimes find it hard to follow the conversation from the transcription. I think that adding a speaker diarization step might make the transcription easier to understand and analyze.<p>I am looking for Speaker Diarization tools that I can use. I have tried using pyannote speaker-diarization-3.1, but I find it does not work very well. What are some other options that I can look at?</p></p></p></div>",

Wrote COBOL to help Atari add features to a inventory processing system to account for the fact that \"inventory\" intially was items received at the loading dock, fork-lifted to the shipping dock and shipped. So \"inventory\" needed to be booked immediately as sales. Now I dabble mostly with Python and JS/HTML. My memory of the Atari gig was that the most critical part was the CICS code. There was just one guy who knew enough to setup the CICS. If he got hit buy a bus... Well after about a year, the bus would not have mattered. Atari buried millions on unsold carts, and I went from working in a beautiful office complex next to Great America Park, to a windowless basement closet somewhere near Mountain View now making changess because the \"forklift inventory\" version was no longer needed. I know this is a bit off topic, but \"COBOL\" was the into I needed. reply",

          "text": "I can’t remark on COBOL, but I did contracting for a time to non-US insurance company replacing their Universe Basic system originally written in the mid 90s, with a .NET Core (3.1 had just come out at the time, around 2019) based system. The system contained records of all their policies including all the premium factors (e.g. make, model, year of car, parking location, physical address, etc). These premium factors were then fed into a rating engine which would use actuarial tables with custom actuarial defined algorithms to determine premiums. In insurance companies, working out the correct premium is core to everything. Insurance companies can have lots of different products and their competitive edge comes from how well they structure their offerings and determine the correct premiums based on risk factors. One does not simply rewrite such a thing. Couple of things I thought were a bit interesting about the place: - Their single server running Universe Basic (with a hot spare I believe) had 4TB of RAM.\n- While I was used to the devs being the stars of the show at the consulting house I worked at, at insurance companies it’s the actuaries. reply",

          "text": "I think you got most details from the others, but insurance is two basically two different things: Life Insurance is mostly a savings product, and the insurance part protects you if you live too long. Property and casualty insurance protects you from losses, including someone's life, but also houses, cars, etc. The domains are quite different, but they both have specific \"insurance business\" computing that's related to actuarial science or analysis, i.e. the statistics needed to calculate reserves, policies, prices etc. I doubt COBOL is used for any actuarial analysis. I think SAS is still strong, but I suspect R is used now. Maybe Python is used in the more static calculations that are handed over to developers, but the actuaries are typically coding whatever they need when they create their models. The rest is just case management, automating business rules, bookkeeping, payments, and for life insurance also systems for trading securities and funds, and possibly in-house tools for asset management. There isn't really a strong case for COBOL. The only reason COBOL still is used is that the insurance companies where early adopters and saw computing as a way to reduce the administrative overhead. The investments were made at a time when trusting some hippies running UNIX wasn't really on the table, and even less so trusting some nerds and their rickety PCs. They built up a workforce with COBOL devs that also gained quite a lot of business knowledge. The digitalisation created another problem - a lot of the older employees were hired to do simple administrative tasks. Even big corporations aren't totally psychopathic so it actually has taken a long time to shift out the employees, and retrain the remainder for the jobs that got more demanding. Even the employees that didn't really have that much high-value domain-specific knowledge to begin with. So the case for more automation was actually not as strong as it could have been. Even still, although especially life insurance is a totally digital product (damage claims is not), they primarily see IT as a cost centre at heart although they probably claim they do not. This has shaped their systems and they have tended to replace their old systems when they're forced by external factors, as the upsides  - better digital sales, more automated decisions, better trading experience for their customers,etc \nare not as easy to achieve as the more tangible administrative automation cost savings they started out with. Actually, this also applies to banks. You could totally run an insurance company or bank without any mainframes or a single line of COBOL. But the organisations still have COBOL developers and maybe more important an upper management that come from that tradition. reply",

( https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/modern-mainframe-d... ) If you're looking for an on-the-job training approach that would enable a career change into the mainframe, Broadcom offers something called the Vitality program ( https://mainframe.broadcom.com/beyondcode/vitality_program ) that runs every year in North America, Europe, and Australia. It's a program that would equip you with serious credentials that could help you land one of those System Programmer jobs or similar. reply",

          "text": "I am working as a mainframe developer at a bank, currently within a kind of data warehouse solution. Mainly writing in COBOL and Java (in USS), with some scripting in Rexx for internal ISPF tools. A lot of SQL as well, we use DB2 as our main database. Most of our processes are EOD centric, we run a lot of batch jobs (mainly TSO, very little IMS). Integrations are mostly file based but we do both call and expose APIs (“regular REST APIs”) as well as consuming from and producing to Kafka among other things. We integrate with both mainframe and distributed systems on prem as well as “internal” systems hosted on cloud. We use Git for source control but have a CI/CD solution that is built in house. Quite a lot of other infrastructure is also built in house. I am mid 30s and am on the younger side looking at the mainframe area as a whole at my employer, however in my team we have several developers is in their 20/30s. My background is mainly back- and frontend development on the Microsoft tech stack but I have worked, and do work, with whatever is at hand/required. But mostly stuff like .NET and SQL Server on the backend, and Angular/Vue/React on the front end before this. reply",

Super handy while reading someone's else code, which is like 90% on large projects. 2. Quick refactorings. Often times I see people discuss in lengths what would/could be instead of just go and try it out quickly, seeing all the pros and cons. Many times I proven myself wrong by trying it out and seeing pitfalls I didn't see earlier. 3. Warnings: so many real bugs could've been prevented if developers had seen (or cared about) to IDE showing a warning. Many PR review suggestions are detectable by a proper IDE without wasting reviewer's time. 4. Hotkeys (what the parent comment was talking about) -- speeds up all of that, especially refactorings, freeing dev's brain for thinking of architecture and other problems. I can go on an on. Sometimes it feels like 50%+ of AI usage for coding is to free up fingers, not knowing that they were already mostly free by using static analysis features/hotkeys. reply",

From a technical-cultural perspective it was mostly sulkiness, and a complete and utter lack of embracing the paradigms of distributed computing. Also, like most internal clouds, there were plenty of issues as it was. Initially they just tried to replace mainframe application components 1:1 onto VMs in whatever way and whenever anything was <100% reliable they complained that our cloud was not able to do it. I had to explain in a very harsh way, under a lot of pressure (I believe not hitting the deadline of switching off the mainframes meant renewal for a year at 40 Mil.. or thereabouts) the realities of \"cloud\". The developers I spoke with in that time though, were very much the opposite of the move fast breaking things crowd. Intelligent, but also narrow minded I would say. reply",

          "text": "I haven't worked in COBOL, but I've worked with it. This was around 1999, and I was building a system for configuring and ordering custom PC's at a large distribution company. One of the feature requirements was that we display inventory over the various options. (ie: There are 373 20G disks in stock, but only 12 30G disks in stock). The idea was that this would let a customer ordering 200 machines know that they should pick the 20G disk if the wanted it now. The way inventory at this company was done was via two systems. There was a normal SQL database that had access to a daily snapshot of inventory taken from a mainframe that always had the up to date data. With the mainframe taking a while to process queries, we used the less current SQL database for the majority of the UI, but took the time to query the mainframe once a customer was in the shopping cart.  Customers might see a change during the flow, but it would at least let them see the most current data prior to committing to a purchase. The mainframe query itself was implemented by someone else as a COBOL job that produced the required inventory numbers.  From my point of view, it was just a limited sort of query conducted over a specialized JDBC driver. (Not necessarily the weirdest aspect of that design.... for a variety of reasons, we did the UI in ASP/VBScript, the back end using Microsoft's JVM invoked via COM Automation, and the SQL database link was via a dubious use of a JDBC/ODBC bridge to connect to SQL Server. It all worked, but not the most solid architecture.) == My only other mainframe experience was working as an intern for a utility company a few years prior (1991-1992). They used CDC Cyber mainframes to run the power grid, using something like 4MM lines of FORTRAN code. The dispatchers themselves interfaced to the system using consoles with 4 19\" color displays running at 1280x1024. Heady stuff for 1991. (The real time weather radar screen was cool too, in an age before the internet made it common place.) reply",

We developed a framework that used annotations on the Java Side to map COBOL Records to Java Objects and invoke transactions over a TCP socket. Learning how to pack decimals and convert encodings was pretty cool. We ended up with a framework that was at least a zillion times faster than the IBM solution.

Synology is expensive (comparatively) but it's been way easier to maintain/manage than my UnRaid servers (I have 3 pro licenses, or whatever the highest tier is/was before they moved to subscriptions). I wanted something that \"just worked\" and so far Synology has fit that bill. reply",

Somebody saved that post and extracted all the links in to the CSV file with their name and karma, and put it on a website(it's not there now).\nI've downloaded that CSV file and slowly went through all 1626 blog links over the last 2 years. I finished just about a week ago. It was quite a journey! Some links I would glance at the homepage and immidiately close, and some I stayed for days - reading all interesting articles from the Archive link. It was a blast! reply",

For example, a disappointing GPT-5 release in August might already trigger such a shift. If that happens, it could also impact the stock prices of major tech companies heavily invested in AI.<p>So, what's your backup plan? Are you diversifying your investments to protect your assets, or are you pulling your money out entirely and going full \"under the mattress\" mode?</p></div>",

I think it's the best thing that's happened to software development in a long time, actually. Other similar tools are probably good too, I just haven't used them yet. But I'd hardly call that a transformational technology ushering in a new era of civilization. It took decades for electricity to transform the way we live. Same with computers 100 years later.

          "text": "This is an issue with the prompt and/or the tool descriptions and/or the model. A MCP server is really just a collection of functions the model can call, and a list of those functions and their description/input params. In theory the MCP connector is calling /get-tools on the MCP servers and injecting that into the prompt, so the model knows which tools are available, their description and input params.  It's then up to the model to pick a specific tool to use. I don't know where specifically the MCP tools are injected into the prompt or what the original system prompt is (ie: maybe it's saying \"always give the internal tools priority and only use MCPs if nothing else fits\"). It could be the MCP server has poor descriptions of the tool.  That is what the model uses to decide to use it or not. It could also be the model just sucks.  Claude Opus/Sonnet seem to be some of the best at tool calling, but it's still up to the model to pick which tools to use.  Some models are better than other. Some models start to regress in their tool calling abilities as the context window fills up. My instinct is the MCP tools have bad descriptions.  I've done a bit of reverse engineering of Claude Code and most of the tool descriptions are very detailed.  \"Use this tool to call a bash command\" would be a bad tool description.  The Claude Code bash tool description is 110 lines long containing detailed usage information, when to use it, when not to use it, example usage and etc. It also has a summary at the bottom of very important things (that were just written above in the same description) for the model not to forget (they use the word IMPORTANT and YOU MUST a lot in the prompts/descriptions) reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">My oldest child is now reading without incommensurable effort, and this is the time I imagined I would introduce computers to my children.<p>I have in my mind the idea that I start them off from an offline barebones command-line interface, and then we gradually learn file management and maybe other things in that environment while it is still shiny. At some point the child is familiar enough with the computer that we install X or Wayland or whatever it may be. This is mainly in order to start them off in a fairly safe environment until they have shown they are able to handle more.<p>The questions I have are:<p>(1) Is this a good idea? I'm aware they'll probably run into Windows as soon as they enter elementary school, but I'm not too concerned they'd fall behind their peers.<p>(2) Which OS would be a good fit? I had my sights set on NetBSD at first, but then I learned its non-graphical interface does not support Unicode, which is probably a dealbreaker since our native language uses non-ASCII characters.[1]<p>I'm still leaning toward a BSD because it would be more of a complete, stand-alone operating system than a Linux distribution, but I'm willing to be convinced otherwise.<p>[1]: Not that I'm planning to localise the OS, but I suspect we'd start off creating files with little messages in our own language.</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hey HN,<p>I'm in a tough spot and could use some outside perspective, especially from anyone who's navigated startup politics or EU/Dutch employment law.<p>I'm a senior engineer with a background at bigger tech companies in the US. A few months ago, I took a job at a small-ish (around 150 people), fully remote tech startup based in Europe. The pay is good for the EU, though definitely a big step down from my US salary. The main reason for the move was to get a visa and work in Europe, and the project (AI stuff) seemed really exciting.<p>It's been a chaotic ride. The project has been in a constant \"prototyping\" phase, with the product direction pivoting at least 4-5 times since I joined. As the main frontend dev, I've been building and refactoring constantly to keep up. It's been high-pressure, but I thought we were making good progress.<p>Recently, things took a sharp turn. My manager, who is new to management and I report directly to, put me on a formal PIP. This was a total shock, as it was literally the first time he'd ever given me any formal managerial feedback. We've never had a single 1-on-1. The reasons cited in the PIP are subjective things like \"code quality\" and \"seniority.\"<p>The part that feels off is that the \"messy\" code they're pointing to is a direct result of the constant pivots and the \"move fast\" culture we've all been working in. My manager's own PRs have introduced critical bugs that I've had to stay late to fix. It feels less like a real performance issue and more like they needed a scapegoat because the project is under pressure.<p>Now things are escalating. I was recently excluded from a key project Slack channel where launch feedback was being shared. And I just got an automated email asking me to sign a contract amendment that cuts my salary by nearly 20%.<p>I know my contract (permanent, Dutch) gives me strong protections, and I've started pushing back on the procedural flaws with HR, which seems to be working. I'm documenting everything.<p>My question for the HN community is:<p>1) For those who've been in a similar startup PIP situation, what's the real end game here? Is this a genuine attempt to \"improve\" me, or is it just the first step in managing me out?<p>2) Any advice on how to handle the day-to-day emotional drain of working with a manager who you feel is actively trying to undermine you, while still needing to be \"professional\" and collaborative on PRs?<p>3) Are they trying to pressure me into quitting or accepting a lowball settlement offer (VSO)?<p>4) I'm trying to stay strategic and not get emotional, but it's tough when you feel like you're being disrespected.<p>Any advice or shared experiences would be incredibly helpful. Thanks!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

In the meantime, you'll have an employment gap and an employer who plays fast and loose with the law, so they might be willing to do other things like shit talk you during reference checks.

Mostly self-taught, but I got quite a bit of employer-provided training and mentoring especially early in my career. I got recruited by a big company while in school, put university on hold and never got around to finishing. I'd have a history degree if I had gone back to school -- programming started as an interest and hobby for me, one that took over all of my spare time in high school and college. My kids (two with degrees, one went to a vocational program) all have jobs, but none of them work in tech or software. I can't imagine trying to get a job today as a junior, especially without a STEM degree. Plenty of employers (or freelance customers) will overlook credentials if the candidate has experience and a reputation, but young people fresh out of school don't have any of that. Employers seem completely unwilling to take a chance on young people eager to work and learn. I get the impression that very few employers put any resources into training or mentoring their programmers, instead they want to hire people who exactly match some checklist or \"skill set\" and fob the screening and interviewing off to HR, recruiters, and now AI. reply",

          "text": "I have no degree at all. I’ve been doing software development professionally for around seven years now. Like many, I’ve started programming as a hobby as a child, around 11 or 12. I got pigeonholed quickly into enterprise development, mostly at non tech companies of various sizes. I knew I never wanted to work as a software dev professionally. I had other plans initially that fell through. However I found myself in a situation where my choices were to struggle off of a low skill job or try and break into the industry have a reasonably comfortable life. Of course, even that didn’t work out as expected. I was significantly underpaid (even with local COL/salary data in mind), still at least it was a foot in the door and a full time job. My salary came more in line with what someone would expect in a small city around the time, but still barely at the bottom of that range. Around the time of the COVID glut, I finally landed a six figure job, as well as the closest thing I’ve had to a job ”in tech”. It was pretty decent, but half the company was dumped a year or two later. I didn’t expect to have much of an issue in the market, ignorant of how bad it really was and with the understanding that with my experience I couldn’t be a total pariah. Instead it took over a year to find a new job and that was solely due to nepotism. A little bit into my current job, I realized my career was dead. I don’t keep up with the industry outside my day to day anymore, I’m certainly not keeping up with newer fresher people and to some extend miss that enthusiasm. But it really does not interest me anymore. Rarely the tech and never the product. I’ve thought about leaving before that happens, but I have yet to see a path to something else that I wouldn’t hate just as much. I figure I’ll either die of from stagnation or AI will replace me or lower that value of my work to the point where the money is no longer worth staying reply",

          "text": "I'm a self-taught programmer, been coding since I was 12. Went to university for a science degree, but it was my programming skills that ended up being way more useful and lucrative. Worked in various technical roles since I was 18, from data engineering at major research hospital, technical due-diligence for venture capital, startups, ML research, etc. Basically, my degree didn't seem to matter. At the moment, I'm running a program for self-directed CS education[1] and end up talking to a lot of people who were self-taught. Part of the motivation for the program was that we found that people we hired who had a lot of self-directed experiences were much better engineers. It wasn't that degrees were necessarily bad, but it seemed like the thing that made them good was not the degree. From my experience talking to people who were also mostly self-taught, the outcomes are a mixed bag. In retrospect, I think I was quite lucky in that I had the right support structures (mentors, etc) in place throughout my life. Some I worked towards, others kinda fell in my lap. In addition, some of my earlier career/life decisions based on hunches have worked out so far (pivoting from medicine to ML in 2012). Not everyone I talked to had the same experience. Some really languished because they really had no support / positive influences. Others think it's one of the best decisions they've made, in both time/money saved and agency. If I had to summarize, one of the major negatives is that self-directed education frontloads a lot of the problems early on. You're in total control, but also exposed to all your mistakes. If you don't have the right environment, you can flounder in the sense that you don't even know what you're missing. This is compounded by our terrible K-12 education system, which does not prepare you for self-direction. If you don't have other sources of support, it could lead you to a vicious cycle of failure begetting failure. You'll also be \"marked\" [2] and mistakes/setbacks will be attributed to your lack of degree, whether justified or not. From a career perspective, some hiring managers are not incentivized to take risks on non-degree holders. Ie. it could blow back on them if you don't work out. You'll have to work harder on signaling and networking, etc. You're not going \"fit\", esp in a degree-heavy culture, and that could lead to social isolation. The positives is that, at the moment, there's never been a better time to self-direct your education. You end up learning things that interest you, at your pace at the right time, so the problems/work is always relevant. You can go really deep really fast. The people that you want to work for/with don't care about your degree. Self-directed education is inevitable, esp in tech. Every one of us eventually have to take control of our education. The problems you have to work through early on are also inevitable (ex. signaling to others that you are competent). The agency and sense of control is great for your mental well-being and developing accountability. Your team can count on you to take the initiative, figure things out, and learn the things you need to learn. Uncertainty is not paralyzing. You've dealt with it your whole life. Overall, it's not an easy path. I think a lot of it depends on early support and the mental attitude/personality of the individual.

          "text": "I’ve built multiple RAG pipelines across Windsurf, Claude, and even Gemini-Codex hybrids, and I’ve learned this: Most of the current devtools are competing at the UX/UI layer — not the semantic inference layer. Claude dominates because it \"feels smart\" during code manipulation — but that’s not a model quality issue. It’s that Claude’s underlying attention bias aligns better with certain symbolic abstractions (e.g. loop repair or inline type assumptions). Cursor and Windsurf ride that perception well. But if you inspect real semantic coherence across chained retrievals or ask them to operate across nonlinear logic breaks, most tools fall apart. That’s why I stopped benchmarking tools by \"stars\" and started treating meaning-routing as a core design variable. I wrote a weird little engine to explore this problem: https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY It’s more a semantic firewall than an IDE — but it solves the exact thing these tools fail at: continuity of symbolic inference. tl;dr: The tools that win attention don’t always win in recursive reasoning. And eventually, reasoning is what devs will benchmark. reply",

Claude Code wins for me for one simple reason: I can just pay for a MAX account and not worry about running out of credits or going through my credit card limit.

For example scientific research uses conda a lot, but I've rarely seen it used by code devs. People using only python will often have more system wide setup with tools and linters than those mixing different projects. Also you'll see some deprecated in tool use in projects which are older and not worth changing without a good reason. Etc. With that out of the way: mise for managing versions of all the runtimes (asdf is fine too), uv for packages (previously poetry which is ok), mypy type checking for things I make. Otherwise I switch between projects a lot so just use whatever the projects use by default. Deployment tools aren't really language specific (when they are they're rarely good). The editing, it's just Cursor, although I did like the jetbrains IDE previously. But overall - just give things a go. It's usually quite easy to swap those tools as needed. reply",

(An issue if you have sensory issues)<p>This is not actually the first time I’ve dealt with discrimination in the workplace.<p>Unfortunately, I work in a relatively specialized field (infosec).<p>Despite having more experience than during my last job search for analyst roles, some of it on things you simply can’t learn on in a home lab like a SIEM + having documented pentest experience, I haven’t gotten a single phone screen or interview.<p>Due to recent geopolitics “going federal” doesn’t appear to be an option.<p>How would you deal with a situation like the above? Should I expand my search to other titles? Maybe go into sales or something?<p>During my last search, the barrier seemed to be I couldn’t document my experience since I was mostly self taught, but I was at least getting interviews and people seemed to respect that I was honest in my skills and had a genuine interest in the subject matter. (It’s actually my “special interest” – every day I read HN + a custom multireddit I made to stay abreast of developments in infosec)<p>I’m feeling really dejected – I gave up on a dream of doing tech policy to “return to my roots” as a hacker here in my home county and my role, which was for a local government, was rewarding and had great benefits. (Pension, time off etc.)<p>I could handle not being a cultural fit for DC, but I feel like my homeland has abused me.<p>Feelings aside, as a practical matter… I need income.<p>Has anyone else navigated a situation like this? How did you manage to get interviews and eventually a role? Are there any projects I could do to help make myself more marketable?<p>(In the past I’ve done things like fly out to network at Defcon but that is not feasible this year due to my financial situation.)</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Guten Abend! Sadly, I am not German. I had some fascinating discussions in my younger days taking DB around Europe. (They have a very good English UI and Ich spreche kein Deutsch beyond travel niceties) If you know of a legal path to use my skills (pentester turned analyst) in Germany, I'd be happy to discuss emigration, I've been told I can do my depositions remotely, and based on these interactions, which were with a local government agency with a higher standard of behavior than some random company, I don't feel welcome here. To paint a picture, our only social safety net is tied to work... and I wasn't even eligible for unemployment because I'd only been working part time prior to this role. (And doing hackthebox, Defcon volunteering, helping new register voters etc). Also cases like mine require you to allow your case to be investigated the the NLRB or a state level agency, then after 6-12 months you get a \"letter to sue\" if the settlement amount is not to your liking (and it almost never is). And, with our current president's gutting of the NLRB, this timeline gets longer. (Basically, the clock doesn't start til you speak to an investigator, and there is a scarcity of investigators). It is likely when this is over they will be compelled not to state they did not terminate me for cause, but in this liminal period they seem deadset on engaging in behaviors that make me rethink if I want be on their \"blue team\" -- some people don't learn until the helpers who they've abused one too many times move on to greener pastures. Anyways, I kind of hoped to focus on how to find work rather than get into the weeds on the events leading to my departure but I hope the above helps folks understand why I must make the choices I am making. reply",

It also feels very specific. Was being screamed at a regular issue with your supervisor in the job where you made this request for accommodation? Or was it at a prior job and you wanted to defend against that specific situation in this job? As written it's like you're saying \"My supervisor is a shouty asshole\" or \"I expect to be in conflict with my supervisor, and I expect that conflict to come to yelling.\" Neither of those are really about your disability, they're about your supervisor and your relationship with them. You can't fix either of those with disability accommodations. Not that it helps much in your current situation, but next time consider different wording, maybe something like: \"I need recovery time after stressful interactions, and I do not want to be penalized when I take that time.\" reply",

          "text": "Fun fact: apparently \"hostile\" work environment, in the legal sense, doesn't cover things like shouting, or apparently even throwing things if they don't connect with you (!). So to be honest, it was partly a backdoor way to handle a mishandled harassment issue. (In addition to refusing to engage in the interactive process, they did not follow their own internal policies on investigating harassment complaints.) So it was two issues in parallel: One was a harassment issue, the other was some sensory things. One of the accommodations I asked for was written feedback -- a common one for folks on the spectrum. This made the person angry, since it's hard to say \"I told you to do X, why did you do X\" when it's in writing instead of a verbal discussion. Anyways, my goal is to just move on, treat the eventual windfall (they've already tried offering me $ at least once) as if it doesn't exist, and try to keep on doing the work I love -- if it had had a different culture I'd have kept on even if I hit the lottery. Hence the HN post -- I can't be the first person to be retaliated against, and I'd like to think if I can provide references and point at projects/duties I'd easily be able to move on to a similar role at another company. Aside from the shouting thing, a lot of what I asked for would be met in a hybrid or remote role, since by their nature you need to do a lot of written comms to keep ppl on the same page. reply",

And so (as I referred to a couple comments down) OpenAI and the others are in the Google pre-2006 moment where the products are highly successfully engaging and grabbing our attention, but they haven't quite found the business model that prints money in the way Google Ads do.

          "text": "Yup, but my earlier comment was a bit flippant, so here’s a more in-depth response. It was an answer to the OP’s question about why Gmail search feels broken, and a nod to the previous comment pointing out Google’s core business is selling ads. In that context, Gmail isn’t optimized for superior search. It’s part of a data funnel that enables keyword targeting, ad placement, and behavioral profiling. For me, there’s a deeper product lesson here, but also a signal about how someone thinks. Whether a candidate answers “ads” or “search” or “email” isn’t what really matters. It’s the why behind the answer that matters most. At the end of the day, business models directly shape product decisions. That tension is something every product manager has to navigate because they sit between the business and technical sides of a company. Being able to see and articulate that tradeoff, especially when user needs diverge from monetization incentives, is key to both building effectively and being a successful product manager. More often the business model, like subscriptions, is more tightly connected to the product. User has X problem that product Y solves and the company receives Z dollars in exchange for access. However, there are many examples where the pricing or monetization strategy is not so clearly connected to the feature set, of which google search is a great example. For the record, I don't ask this question to junior PMs. reply",

There are two potential reasons: 1) They have a problem with the Unicode-character, which is not that uncommon with foreign-companies, that they miss some details on a local market. 2) Most search-systems have long moved to fuzzy results, with exact search being a more and more flawed option. And this goes even deeper, as they have started to expand search terms, and show you different words with the same or even just similar meaning. And of course, there is also the solution that the search works correct, but just doesn't show you the part where this sign is, like somewhere in the header, hidden in some alternative view or an attachment, or something like that. reply",

My primary email is apart of some vast international spam program where the mail servers responsible for sending me spam forge headers, falsify source record information, lie about which downstream service provider is hosting them, etc. It’s really quite interesting, but more so than that, it’s annoying. I pondered my problem for a few days, thinking about what sort of external service I could use to surgically remove these numerous, daily, very specifically identifiable spam emails before I stumbled on a thread on StackOverflow where some people discussed using Google App Scripts to do this very thing. I’d recommend searching the web for that sort of topic. You’ll find that there’s a way to set up an hourly script job that will wipe this spam completely off your mailbox and find some peace. Hope this points you in the right direction. The idea of having to use yet another Google service to fix an existing separate one is such a stupid labyrinthine experience, but at least it beats having to set up a job on a VPS for this. If you had this issue with another mailbox service provider, a VPS approach would probably be necessary, though. reply",

This is more complicated than it would first sound as it will mean decoding MIME and various sub-encodings to extract the plain text so I can properly query it, hence that project is still on my “when hell freezes over so I have enough free time” list.

Gave evidence. It canceled the subscription within 20 mins. Also gemini flash is unreliable. The best cost efficiency today seems to be gpt-4.1. The cheaper models seem to be okay for summarization mostly. Gemini Flash was much better a year ago, still unreliable, but at least it followed instructions. reply",

I really mind this because I'm trying to find real information on topics - or at least someone who claims to be any kind of authority on a subject. But what I often run into is pure AI hallucination.<p>One such example is fake mental health videos. An instance:<p>\"7 Dangerous Places Carl Jung Says You Must Avoid to Stay Mentally Strong\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wUdOVB-DQw<p>188k views, name recognition for credibility, but if you search for \"7 Dangerous Places Carl Jung\" on the Internet, Carl Jung didn't seem to have point out 7 of such places actually. But on YouTube, there at least 9 very similarly titled and thumbnailed video, from different channels, and different 7 of such places actually too!<p>So... how do you react to this phenomenon? Are you impacted by it? Might be that you haven't noticed it, or didn't seek out content that I have seen faked, like indigenous stories, space videos, psychology topics?</p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I no longer develop in COBOL but I did for 20 years, and never touched a mainframe. I worked on a mid-size vertical ERP system (back then it wasn't called \"ERP\") that originated on Data General using Interactive COBOL, which is where the SCREEN SECTION originated. The application (thousands of programs) were ported to Unix with a ICOBOL compatible compiler (no longer available) and then later to AcuCOBOL was absorbed by MicroFocus, but now looks like an independent company has revived it as an independent product (Rocket). One of my projects was to rip out most COBOL I/O and replace with embedded SQL. Later it was ported to Windows, and used the GUI controls available in AcuCOBOL. You'd have been hard pressed to tell the difference between those COBOL apps and any VB6 or WPF app on Windows. With embedded SQL, the GUI controls in the SCREEN SECTION, and COBOL p-code and memory management, it was actually a rather nice little 4GL type development system. Many people who look down upon COBOL never actually used it. It had its flaws for sure, but it wasn't all that bad. reply",

          "text": "Very old coder here. Wrote COBOL to help Atari add features to a inventory processing system to account for the fact that \"inventory\" intially was items received at the loading dock, fork-lifted to the shipping dock and shipped. So \"inventory\" needed to be booked immediately as sales. Now I dabble mostly with Python and JS/HTML. My memory of the Atari gig was that the most critical part was the CICS code. There was just one guy who knew enough to setup the CICS. If he got hit buy a bus... Well after about a year, the bus would not have mattered. Atari buried millions on unsold carts, and I went from working in a beautiful office complex next to Great America Park, to a windowless basement closet somewhere near Mountain View now making changess because the \"forklift inventory\" version was no longer needed. I know this is a bit off topic, but \"COBOL\" was the into I needed. reply",

The system contained records of all their policies including all the premium factors (e.g. make, model, year of car, parking location, physical address, etc). These premium factors were then fed into a rating engine which would use actuarial tables with custom actuarial defined algorithms to determine premiums. In insurance companies, working out the correct premium is core to everything. Insurance companies can have lots of different products and their competitive edge comes from how well they structure their offerings and determine the correct premiums based on risk factors. One does not simply rewrite such a thing. Couple of things I thought were a bit interesting about the place: - Their single server running Universe Basic (with a hot spare I believe) had 4TB of RAM.\n- While I was used to the devs being the stars of the show at the consulting house I worked at, at insurance companies it’s the actuaries. reply",

          "text": "I think you got most details from the others, but insurance is two basically two different things: Life Insurance is mostly a savings product, and the insurance part protects you if you live too long. Property and casualty insurance protects you from losses, including someone's life, but also houses, cars, etc. The domains are quite different, but they both have specific \"insurance business\" computing that's related to actuarial science or analysis, i.e. the statistics needed to calculate reserves, policies, prices etc. I doubt COBOL is used for any actuarial analysis. I think SAS is still strong, but I suspect R is used now. Maybe Python is used in the more static calculations that are handed over to developers, but the actuaries are typically coding whatever they need when they create their models. The rest is just case management, automating business rules, bookkeeping, payments, and for life insurance also systems for trading securities and funds, and possibly in-house tools for asset management. There isn't really a strong case for COBOL. The only reason COBOL still is used is that the insurance companies where early adopters and saw computing as a way to reduce the administrative overhead. The investments were made at a time when trusting some hippies running UNIX wasn't really on the table, and even less so trusting some nerds and their rickety PCs. They built up a workforce with COBOL devs that also gained quite a lot of business knowledge. The digitalisation created another problem - a lot of the older employees were hired to do simple administrative tasks. Even big corporations aren't totally psychopathic so it actually has taken a long time to shift out the employees, and retrain the remainder for the jobs that got more demanding. Even the employees that didn't really have that much high-value domain-specific knowledge to begin with. So the case for more automation was actually not as strong as it could have been. Even still, although especially life insurance is a totally digital product (damage claims is not), they primarily see IT as a cost centre at heart although they probably claim they do not. This has shaped their systems and they have tended to replace their old systems when they're forced by external factors, as the upsides  - better digital sales, more automated decisions, better trading experience for their customers,etc \nare not as easy to achieve as the more tangible administrative automation cost savings they started out with. Actually, this also applies to banks. You could totally run an insurance company or bank without any mainframes or a single line of COBOL. But the organisations still have COBOL developers and maybe more important an upper management that come from that tradition. reply",

Integrations are mostly file based but we do both call and expose APIs (“regular REST APIs”) as well as consuming from and producing to Kafka among other things.

          "text": "I quickly worked at a company like that, that had large parts of their core business logic running on an AS400, and they were asking what they need to do to migrate to something newer - was surreal. A few hundred employees all interacting with the system - in building A, a deliver arrives, they scan it like this, press this button. Building B, a guys job was to oversee the conversion of tables from As400 to a csv format suitable for some other outsourced software.  Data goes into system C and shows to employees working on conveyor belts this and that. Hundreds of kilometers away, truck drivers get a notification for this and that.b And, nobody knew how the whole worked. Everyone has their niche of interaction with the system. They would be able to shave off an insane percentage off expenses (in the form of employees whose job exists for no real reason), but the switching costs would also be immense. I sometimes wonder what came of their company. The system was so far beyond the complexity that anyone could grasp, they had no inhouse devs, they'd need people with the competency to judge which competency they need. reply",

As a result, these legacy systems are often using default passwords, have tons of crazy stuff exposed to the network, and are comprised of custom code written specifically for the business purpose (so the documentation is only as good as what they made). On the other hand, these guys generally write pretty neat, lean code that is quick, reliable, and directly responsive to the business.

          "text": "Hard disagree. Few points I can easily remember: 1. Navigating the code, e.g easily see all the callers, navigate up/down the call tree requires static code analysis. Super handy while reading someone's else code, which is like 90% on large projects. 2. Quick refactorings. Often times I see people discuss in lengths what would/could be instead of just go and try it out quickly, seeing all the pros and cons. Many times I proven myself wrong by trying it out and seeing pitfalls I didn't see earlier. 3. Warnings: so many real bugs could've been prevented if developers had seen (or cared about) to IDE showing a warning. Many PR review suggestions are detectable by a proper IDE without wasting reviewer's time. 4. Hotkeys (what the parent comment was talking about) -- speeds up all of that, especially refactorings, freeing dev's brain for thinking of architecture and other problems. I can go on an on. Sometimes it feels like 50%+ of AI usage for coding is to free up fingers, not knowing that they were already mostly free by using static analysis features/hotkeys. reply",

And also having worked at IBM in the past where I sat adjacent to the mainframe support team for Business Services, I totally get it. Mainframes are awesome if you ask me, and in a sense we have been trying to reinvent a lot of its goodness with \"commodity\" x86 hardware. From a technical-cultural perspective it was mostly sulkiness, and a complete and utter lack of embracing the paradigms of distributed computing. Also, like most internal clouds, there were plenty of issues as it was. Initially they just tried to replace mainframe application components 1:1 onto VMs in whatever way and whenever anything was <100% reliable they complained that our cloud was not able to do it. I had to explain in a very harsh way, under a lot of pressure (I believe not hitting the deadline of switching off the mainframes meant renewal for a year at 40 Mil.. or thereabouts) the realities of \"cloud\". The developers I spoke with in that time though, were very much the opposite of the move fast breaking things crowd. Intelligent, but also narrow minded I would say. reply",

          "text": "I haven't worked in COBOL, but I've worked with it. This was around 1999, and I was building a system for configuring and ordering custom PC's at a large distribution company. One of the feature requirements was that we display inventory over the various options. (ie: There are 373 20G disks in stock, but only 12 30G disks in stock). The idea was that this would let a customer ordering 200 machines know that they should pick the 20G disk if the wanted it now. The way inventory at this company was done was via two systems. There was a normal SQL database that had access to a daily snapshot of inventory taken from a mainframe that always had the up to date data. With the mainframe taking a while to process queries, we used the less current SQL database for the majority of the UI, but took the time to query the mainframe once a customer was in the shopping cart.  Customers might see a change during the flow, but it would at least let them see the most current data prior to committing to a purchase. The mainframe query itself was implemented by someone else as a COBOL job that produced the required inventory numbers.  From my point of view, it was just a limited sort of query conducted over a specialized JDBC driver. (Not necessarily the weirdest aspect of that design.... for a variety of reasons, we did the UI in ASP/VBScript, the back end using Microsoft's JVM invoked via COM Automation, and the SQL database link was via a dubious use of a JDBC/ODBC bridge to connect to SQL Server. It all worked, but not the most solid architecture.) == My only other mainframe experience was working as an intern for a utility company a few years prior (1991-1992). They used CDC Cyber mainframes to run the power grid, using something like 4MM lines of FORTRAN code. The dispatchers themselves interfaced to the system using consoles with 4 19\" color displays running at 1280x1024. Heady stuff for 1991. (The real time weather radar screen was cool too, in an age before the internet made it common place.) reply",

We developed a framework that used annotations on the Java Side to map COBOL Records to Java Objects and invoke transactions over a TCP socket. Learning how to pack decimals and convert encodings was pretty cool. We ended up with a framework that was at least a zillion times faster than the IBM solution.

We upgraded our old mainframes to IBM Z16's, and we just got some new ones in recently for our backup server. Part of the job is taking whatever they decide in legislation and translating that into code that processes whatever they decided to make law, from fees, suspensions, special legislation for certain areas, etc. Our programming environment primarily uses TSO/ISPF and changeman for version control. We have access to IBM's IDz (previously RDz) as an IDE for development, and I would personally prefer to use that but haven't been able to get it installed on my work computer due to licensing issues. Part of security protocol is that we cannot use anything open-source, so VSCode with Zowe is, unfortunately, out of the picture. We maintain a lot of old programs and modules, but we are also actively developing new programs as we expand our IT department - and yes, that is new COBOL programs. We have a Linux side as well which mainly deals with the web-side, but they still interact with the mainframe to call on modules - but all they are really doing is sending data to CICS to get data back. They do not know anything about the COBOL itself or how to program in it. reply",

Actually, tbf, my daughter's pretty interested in my coding and electronics projects. She picks things up alarmingly fast. I taught her a practically-one-way encoding scheme for passwords I've had incredible trouble teaching anyone else (LLMs also can't figure it out), and she completely understood it after the second example I gave and even added her own extra twist to it. Her passwords now are both memorable and extremely secure against dictionary attacks even with any mutation  scheme someone could reasonably imagine. -So I think that should probably go in the plus column. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hi,<p>I am making a tool that needs to analyze a conversation (non-English) between two people. The conversation is provided to me in audio format. I am currently using OpenAI Whisper to transcribe and feed the transcription to ChatGPT-4o model through the API for analysis.<p>So far, it's doing a fair job. Sometimes, though, reading the transcription, I find it hard to figure out which speaker is speaking what. I have to listen to the audio to figure it out. I am wondering if ChatGPT-4o would also sometimes find it hard to follow the conversation from the transcription. I think that adding a speaker diarization step might make the transcription easier to understand and analyze.<p>I am looking for Speaker Diarization tools that I can use. I have tried using pyannote speaker-diarization-3.1, but I find it does not work very well. What are some other options that I can look at?</p></p></p></div>",

My shell script for wrapping llama.cpp's llama-cli and Gemma3: http://ciar.org/h/g3 That script references this grammar file which forces llama.cpp to infer only ASCII: http://ciar.org/h/ascii.gbnf Cost: electricity I've been meaning to check out Aider and GLM-4, but even if it's all it's cracked up to be, I expect to use it sparingly.  Skills which aren't exercised are lost, and I'd like to keep my programming skills sharp. reply",

ChatGPT 4o is useless except for Q&A. I see no value in paying more -- the utility rapidly diminishes, because at this point the UI surrounding the models is far less important than the models themselves, which in turn are generally less important than the size of their context windows. Even Claude is only marginally better than Gemini (at coding), and they all suck to the point that I wouldn't trust any of them without reviewing every line. Far better to just pick a tool, get comfortable with it, and not screw around too much. I don't understand people who pay hundreds of dollars a month for multiple tools. It feels like audiophiles paying $1000 for a platinum cable connector. reply",

If you want to skimp you can drop one of the GPUs until you're sure you need 48GB VRAM and some of the RAM but you really don't save that much. Just make sure you get a case that can fit multiple full size GPU and a mobo that can support it as well. The slot configurations are pretty bad on the AM5 generation for multi GPU. You'll probably end up with a mobo such as Asus ProArt Also none of this is worth the money because it's simply not possible to run the same kinds of models you pay for online on a standard home system. Things like ChatGPT 4o use more VRAM than you'll ever be able to scrounge up unless your budget is closer to $10,000-25,000+. Think multiple RTX A6000 cards or similar.

Mostly self-taught, but I got quite a bit of employer-provided training and mentoring especially early in my career. I got recruited by a big company while in school, put university on hold and never got around to finishing. I'd have a history degree if I had gone back to school -- programming started as an interest and hobby for me, one that took over all of my spare time in high school and college. My kids (two with degrees, one went to a vocational program) all have jobs, but none of them work in tech or software. I can't imagine trying to get a job today as a junior, especially without a STEM degree. Plenty of employers (or freelance customers) will overlook credentials if the candidate has experience and a reputation, but young people fresh out of school don't have any of that. Employers seem completely unwilling to take a chance on young people eager to work and learn. I get the impression that very few employers put any resources into training or mentoring their programmers, instead they want to hire people who exactly match some checklist or \"skill set\" and fob the screening and interviewing off to HR, recruiters, and now AI. reply",

I saw a note from another Philosophy grad saying that Philosophy is actually useful in that it gives you a framework and a perspective to look at things a little differently.

          "text": "I have no degree at all. I’ve been doing software development professionally for around seven years now. Like many, I’ve started programming as a hobby as a child, around 11 or 12. I got pigeonholed quickly into enterprise development, mostly at non tech companies of various sizes. I knew I never wanted to work as a software dev professionally. I had other plans initially that fell through. However I found myself in a situation where my choices were to struggle off of a low skill job or try and break into the industry have a reasonably comfortable life. Of course, even that didn’t work out as expected. I was significantly underpaid (even with local COL/salary data in mind), still at least it was a foot in the door and a full time job. My salary came more in line with what someone would expect in a small city around the time, but still barely at the bottom of that range. Around the time of the COVID glut, I finally landed a six figure job, as well as the closest thing I’ve had to a job ”in tech”. It was pretty decent, but half the company was dumped a year or two later. I didn’t expect to have much of an issue in the market, ignorant of how bad it really was and with the understanding that with my experience I couldn’t be a total pariah. Instead it took over a year to find a new job and that was solely due to nepotism. A little bit into my current job, I realized my career was dead. I don’t keep up with the industry outside my day to day anymore, I’m certainly not keeping up with newer fresher people and to some extend miss that enthusiasm. But it really does not interest me anymore. Rarely the tech and never the product. I’ve thought about leaving before that happens, but I have yet to see a path to something else that I wouldn’t hate just as much. I figure I’ll either die of from stagnation or AI will replace me or lower that value of my work to the point where the money is no longer worth staying reply",

At the time, I thought Excel was so cool because it seemed like I could do anything with it. I didn't know anyone who wrote code. I had no no idea what was out there. 11 years with R/Python/SQL in a very small team. The last 5 years over 1500 web scrapes running everyday, and then aggregating, categorizing, and analyzing that data. I've only interviewed a handful of times since starting. It's not come up in any of them, but I've often thought a good response to a \"what's one of your weaknesses\" question, would be to say that I'm self taught. Nobody has ever reviewed any of my code. I have no pretense of it being elegant or the best way to solve a problem, but it's simple, it works, and I'm determined to solve the problem in front of me. reply",

This is much less the case post-degree. In fact I now regularly have to turn down work I frankly feel like I couldn't do as good a job on because I have a language to learn and a citizenship to clinch.

          "text": "I'm a self-taught programmer, been coding since I was 12. Went to university for a science degree, but it was my programming skills that ended up being way more useful and lucrative. Worked in various technical roles since I was 18, from data engineering at major research hospital, technical due-diligence for venture capital, startups, ML research, etc. Basically, my degree didn't seem to matter. At the moment, I'm running a program for self-directed CS education[1] and end up talking to a lot of people who were self-taught. Part of the motivation for the program was that we found that people we hired who had a lot of self-directed experiences were much better engineers. It wasn't that degrees were necessarily bad, but it seemed like the thing that made them good was not the degree. From my experience talking to people who were also mostly self-taught, the outcomes are a mixed bag. In retrospect, I think I was quite lucky in that I had the right support structures (mentors, etc) in place throughout my life. Some I worked towards, others kinda fell in my lap. In addition, some of my earlier career/life decisions based on hunches have worked out so far (pivoting from medicine to ML in 2012). Not everyone I talked to had the same experience. Some really languished because they really had no support / positive influences. Others think it's one of the best decisions they've made, in both time/money saved and agency. If I had to summarize, one of the major negatives is that self-directed education frontloads a lot of the problems early on. You're in total control, but also exposed to all your mistakes. If you don't have the right environment, you can flounder in the sense that you don't even know what you're missing. This is compounded by our terrible K-12 education system, which does not prepare you for self-direction. If you don't have other sources of support, it could lead you to a vicious cycle of failure begetting failure. You'll also be \"marked\" [2] and mistakes/setbacks will be attributed to your lack of degree, whether justified or not. From a career perspective, some hiring managers are not incentivized to take risks on non-degree holders. Ie. it could blow back on them if you don't work out. You'll have to work harder on signaling and networking, etc. You're not going \"fit\", esp in a degree-heavy culture, and that could lead to social isolation. The positives is that, at the moment, there's never been a better time to self-direct your education. You end up learning things that interest you, at your pace at the right time, so the problems/work is always relevant. You can go really deep really fast. The people that you want to work for/with don't care about your degree. Self-directed education is inevitable, esp in tech. Every one of us eventually have to take control of our education. The problems you have to work through early on are also inevitable (ex. signaling to others that you are competent). The agency and sense of control is great for your mental well-being and developing accountability. Your team can count on you to take the initiative, figure things out, and learn the things you need to learn. Uncertainty is not paralyzing. You've dealt with it your whole life. Overall, it's not an easy path. I think a lot of it depends on early support and the mental attitude/personality of the individual.

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">It's 2025, and virtualization is still a headache, even for casual use.<p>I use a MacBook Air M1 as my dev laptop, and I just wanted to have a reproducible dev environment running Debian.<p>My options: use devcontainer, or use a VM on Virtualbox, VMWare, Parallels, UTM, etc.<p>VSCode &amp; Typescript gets messed up every now and then, such that they don't work and I simply can't continue with them. Not sure why, but I think there are weird internal bugs in those that surface whenever there is some special combination of circumstances on my machine. With devcontainer I think VSCode still runs directly on my machine but connects to the container, so this is nto a solution for me, I need a real VM.<p>So I try VirtualBox first. After spending hours installing Debian on a VM and getting it running nicely, within a short time the VM slows to a crawl. Nothing I do reliably fixes this. I also cannto get the display resolution to behave properly. I give up on VirtualBox, again (I keep trying this every few years forgetting why I don't use VirtualBox)<p>Next, I want to try VMWare, only to find out it is sold to Broadcom, and when I follow the link to their page, I'm supposed to log in to download, and yet I see no way to register. Oh well.<p>Next, I try Parallels. After getting a Debian VM running on it, I marvel at how smoothly it works. I'm in the trial, but I'm not going to have a problem paying up if everything goes on well. Alas, it was too good to be true. I start to to have random loss of internet connectivity (weirdly affecting the terminal only) in the VM. I see that the default networking mode is shared networking. I read guides online suggesting to switch to bridged networking. After spending oodles of time setting up the firewall and other security configuration on the VM and switching to bridged networking, I'm still having intermittent connectivity issues. it seems they are even worse now. Suddenly I remember again why I don't have a Parallels subscription after all these years.<p>Frustrated, I finally give up. I ruefully remember that UTM also has similar performance and screen display problems as VirtualBox.<p>So what options are left? I can't really physically install a dual-boot Linux on my Macbook (Asahi notwithstanding, since I only want Debian). Maybe I could sign up for a cloud VPS and use that. Or just buy new AMD mini PCs and run Debian on those. Either way, it's clear the virtualization story, after decades of supposed tech advancement, is still a bitter one.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Still, I am surprised, you seem to imply that you need to provision a new VM because of trouble with TypeScript/VSCode?

          "text": "The problem is that the whole virtualization situation was left as an afterthought in the Apple ecosystem, and it got worse during the Apple Silicon transition years. Just now things are starting to catch up, but there's still a wide gap in features; Apple Virtualization Framework is still very limited. And a personal limitation I hit recently, no USB4/Thunderbolt passthrough anywhere, not in UTM (which uses AVF), not in VMWare either. Also remember the final Apple Silicon version of VMWare supporting M1/M2 wasn't available until November 2022 (it was a tech preview before), while all the Broadcom situation was ensuing. And I think only as of 2024 it runs smoothly. So far it's still the most reliable for desktop Linux VMs for me. Windows 11 for ARM runs very well too, and it does x86 emulation transparently, even 2010s games run well. reply",

          "text": "FWIW, I've used VMWare Fusion on Mac OS for years (and their Workstation product on Linux/Windows since 1999). It has worked well for me so far. VirtualBox used to be not great on MacOS with multiple CPUs and lots of interrupts - I noticed problems when moving from a Mac laptop with a spinning HDD to NVMe SSDs. The slow inter-processor interrupts (IPIs) and some related contention caused concurrent IOs to get very slow with fast SSDs with VirtualBox (back when still running on an Intel Mac with VMWare kernel module). In fact, I could get more IOPS out of the VM with fio when giving just 1-2 vCPUs to the VM, vs 4-8 vCPUs. I haven't tested VirtuaBox on latest Mac versions as I'm happy with VMWare Fusion (also on ARM M1/M2 machines). The product is still good, regardless of Broadcom's business shenanigans. Edit: If Parallels works for you, but only the SSH terminal sessions get stuck, maybe the \"shared network\" connection drops your connections for some reason. Before diving too deep into troubleshooting this across layers, you could try out the usual suspects workaround, setting SSH TCP keepalive. I have this for some connections in my ~/.ssh/config file: TCPKeepalive yes ServerAliveInterval 30 reply",

You mention Typescript which I’ll assume means some sort of web development, one thing to maybe consider is looking at https://omakub.org/ for inspiration on hardware choices and a setup.

Or while working on a feature, I can ask it to delete all the test records I created, etc. I can do that in a repl myself, but it’s sometimes a nice shortcut.

          "text": "This is an issue with the prompt and/or the tool descriptions and/or the model. A MCP server is really just a collection of functions the model can call, and a list of those functions and their description/input params. In theory the MCP connector is calling /get-tools on the MCP servers and injecting that into the prompt, so the model knows which tools are available, their description and input params.  It's then up to the model to pick a specific tool to use. I don't know where specifically the MCP tools are injected into the prompt or what the original system prompt is (ie: maybe it's saying \"always give the internal tools priority and only use MCPs if nothing else fits\"). It could be the MCP server has poor descriptions of the tool.  That is what the model uses to decide to use it or not. It could also be the model just sucks.  Claude Opus/Sonnet seem to be some of the best at tool calling, but it's still up to the model to pick which tools to use.  Some models are better than other. Some models start to regress in their tool calling abilities as the context window fills up. My instinct is the MCP tools have bad descriptions.  I've done a bit of reverse engineering of Claude Code and most of the tool descriptions are very detailed.  \"Use this tool to call a bash command\" would be a bad tool description.  The Claude Code bash tool description is 110 lines long containing detailed usage information, when to use it, when not to use it, example usage and etc. It also has a summary at the bottom of very important things (that were just written above in the same description) for the model not to forget (they use the word IMPORTANT and YOU MUST a lot in the prompts/descriptions) reply",

Claude dominates because it \"feels smart\" during code manipulation — but that’s not a model quality issue. It’s that Claude’s underlying attention bias aligns better with certain symbolic abstractions (e.g. loop repair or inline type assumptions). Cursor and Windsurf ride that perception well. But if you inspect real semantic coherence across chained retrievals or ask them to operate across nonlinear logic breaks, most tools fall apart. That’s why I stopped benchmarking tools by \"stars\" and started treating meaning-routing as a core design variable. I wrote a weird little engine to explore this problem: https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY It’s more a semantic firewall than an IDE — but it solves the exact thing these tools fail at: continuity of symbolic inference. tl;dr: The tools that win attention don’t always win in recursive reasoning. And eventually, reasoning is what devs will benchmark. reply",

Claude Code grabbed tons of attention because it uses the command line and enables developers to boost their productivity. Because it works via the command line, it doesn’t require using an editor/IDE you may not use, and it’s extensible via custom slash commands and hooks. It’s only been out a few months and there’s already a cottage industry of websites, tutorials and videos supporting it. It’s not perfect but it’s really good in ways that matter to developers. I’ve never seen so many developers making videos and blogposts describing how happy they are to pay $200/month for the Max plan due to the productivity gains. reply",

Claude Code wins for me for one simple reason: I can just pay for a MAX account and not worry about running out of credits or going through my credit card limit.

At some point the child is familiar enough with the computer that we install X or Wayland or whatever it may be. This is mainly in order to start them off in a fairly safe environment until they have shown they are able to handle more.<p>The questions I have are:<p>(1) Is this a good idea? I'm aware they'll probably run into Windows as soon as they enter elementary school, but I'm not too concerned they'd fall behind their peers.<p>(2) Which OS would be a good fit? I had my sights set on NetBSD at first, but then I learned its non-graphical interface does not support Unicode, which is probably a dealbreaker since our native language uses non-ASCII characters.[1]<p>I'm still leaning toward a BSD because it would be more of a complete, stand-alone operating system than a Linux distribution, but I'm willing to be convinced otherwise.<p>[1]: Not that I'm planning to localise the OS, but I suspect we'd start off creating files with little messages in our own language.</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hey HN,<p>I'm in a tough spot and could use some outside perspective, especially from anyone who's navigated startup politics or EU/Dutch employment law.<p>I'm a senior engineer with a background at bigger tech companies in the US. A few months ago, I took a job at a small-ish (around 150 people), fully remote tech startup based in Europe. The pay is good for the EU, though definitely a big step down from my US salary. The main reason for the move was to get a visa and work in Europe, and the project (AI stuff) seemed really exciting.<p>It's been a chaotic ride. The project has been in a constant \"prototyping\" phase, with the product direction pivoting at least 4-5 times since I joined. As the main frontend dev, I've been building and refactoring constantly to keep up. It's been high-pressure, but I thought we were making good progress.<p>Recently, things took a sharp turn. My manager, who is new to management and I report directly to, put me on a formal PIP. This was a total shock, as it was literally the first time he'd ever given me any formal managerial feedback. We've never had a single 1-on-1. The reasons cited in the PIP are subjective things like \"code quality\" and \"seniority.\"<p>The part that feels off is that the \"messy\" code they're pointing to is a direct result of the constant pivots and the \"move fast\" culture we've all been working in. My manager's own PRs have introduced critical bugs that I've had to stay late to fix. It feels less like a real performance issue and more like they needed a scapegoat because the project is under pressure.<p>Now things are escalating. I was recently excluded from a key project Slack channel where launch feedback was being shared. And I just got an automated email asking me to sign a contract amendment that cuts my salary by nearly 20%.<p>I know my contract (permanent, Dutch) gives me strong protections, and I've started pushing back on the procedural flaws with HR, which seems to be working. I'm documenting everything.<p>My question for the HN community is:<p>1) For those who've been in a similar startup PIP situation, what's the real end game here? Is this a genuine attempt to \"improve\" me, or is it just the first step in managing me out?<p>2) Any advice on how to handle the day-to-day emotional drain of working with a manager who you feel is actively trying to undermine you, while still needing to be \"professional\" and collaborative on PRs?<p>3) Are they trying to pressure me into quitting or accepting a lowball settlement offer (VSO)?<p>4) I'm trying to stay strategic and not get emotional, but it's tough when you feel like you're being disrespected.<p>Any advice or shared experiences would be incredibly helpful. Thanks!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Feeling like this is a temp situation will help. 3) 100% yes, they're trying to pressure you into leaving. Try to get the best terms you can. 4) Doesn't sound very \"strategic\" to over-stay somewhere that you call \"day-to-day emotional drain of working with a manager who you feel is actively trying to undermine you.\" You should work on your exit. You're talking about strategy, but realistically what do you imagine is the fairy-tail ending of this one? You get to drag it out painfully for both sides? Best case scenario you get to find a workplace that makes you happy, and let them continue their dysfunctional hell until they burn through all their runway without any actual product to show. reply",

And so (as I referred to a couple comments down) OpenAI and the others are in the Google pre-2006 moment where the products are highly successfully engaging and grabbing our attention, but they haven't quite found the business model that prints money in the way Google Ads do.

          "text": "Yup, but my earlier comment was a bit flippant, so here’s a more in-depth response. It was an answer to the OP’s question about why Gmail search feels broken, and a nod to the previous comment pointing out Google’s core business is selling ads. In that context, Gmail isn’t optimized for superior search. It’s part of a data funnel that enables keyword targeting, ad placement, and behavioral profiling. For me, there’s a deeper product lesson here, but also a signal about how someone thinks. Whether a candidate answers “ads” or “search” or “email” isn’t what really matters. It’s the why behind the answer that matters most. At the end of the day, business models directly shape product decisions. That tension is something every product manager has to navigate because they sit between the business and technical sides of a company. Being able to see and articulate that tradeoff, especially when user needs diverge from monetization incentives, is key to both building effectively and being a successful product manager. More often the business model, like subscriptions, is more tightly connected to the product. User has X problem that product Y solves and the company receives Z dollars in exchange for access. However, there are many examples where the pricing or monetization strategy is not so clearly connected to the feature set, of which google search is a great example. For the record, I don't ask this question to junior PMs. reply",

My primary email is apart of some vast international spam program where the mail servers responsible for sending me spam forge headers, falsify source record information, lie about which downstream service provider is hosting them, etc. It’s really quite interesting, but more so than that, it’s annoying. I pondered my problem for a few days, thinking about what sort of external service I could use to surgically remove these numerous, daily, very specifically identifiable spam emails before I stumbled on a thread on StackOverflow where some people discussed using Google App Scripts to do this very thing. I’d recommend searching the web for that sort of topic. You’ll find that there’s a way to set up an hourly script job that will wipe this spam completely off your mailbox and find some peace. Hope this points you in the right direction. The idea of having to use yet another Google service to fix an existing separate one is such a stupid labyrinthine experience, but at least it beats having to set up a job on a VPS for this. If you had this issue with another mailbox service provider, a VPS approach would probably be necessary, though. reply",

There are two potential reasons: 1) They have a problem with the Unicode-character, which is not that uncommon with foreign-companies, that they miss some details on a local market. 2) Most search-systems have long moved to fuzzy results, with exact search being a more and more flawed option. And this goes even deeper, as they have started to expand search terms, and show you different words with the same or even just similar meaning. And of course, there is also the solution that the search works correct, but just doesn't show you the part where this sign is, like somewhere in the header, hidden in some alternative view or an attachment, or something like that. reply",

I know they are completely separate divisions, but still… Both they and gmail have trouble finding someple words and sentence fragments that I know are in there and, worse, instead of just saying they can't find it they often return a bunch of useless stuff just-in-case I meant that instead. I keep thinking of writing an IMAP->SQL interface¹ so I can search more manually that way. Or even just mapping to files in a filesystem² so I can find/grep/etc, though the DB option would also allow some more complex searches (search for X in messages that are replies to messages containing Y, for example). -------- [1] Keeping mail on the mail server, but syncing it with a DB. This is more complicated than it would first sound as it will mean decoding MIME and various sub-encodings to extract the plain text so I can properly query it, hence that project is still on my “when hell freezes over so I have enough free time” list. [2] Yeah, maildir and similar storage formats already do this, but there is still the unpacking/decoding issue before being able to directly search the text of many messages. reply",

For example scientific research uses conda a lot, but I've rarely seen it used by code devs. People using only python will often have more system wide setup with tools and linters than those mixing different projects. Also you'll see some deprecated in tool use in projects which are older and not worth changing without a good reason. Etc. With that out of the way: mise for managing versions of all the runtimes (asdf is fine too), uv for packages (previously poetry which is ok), mypy type checking for things I make. Otherwise I switch between projects a lot so just use whatever the projects use by default. Deployment tools aren't really language specific (when they are they're rarely good). The editing, it's just Cursor, although I did like the jetbrains IDE previously. But overall - just give things a go. It's usually quite easy to swap those tools as needed. reply",

I think language servers and autocomplete are much more useful for .net (I used to do a lot of C# as a freelancer in college) than they are for python. Personally I just open a REPL and tab around in that if I need it but I do that maybe once a month. Most software is well organized such that you can keep enough of the theory in your head for the default nvim config to work easily. A small FITM model with a ring context like Qwen can help a bit with boilerplate if you really want autocomplete. Python just isn't that verbose. reply",

Wrote COBOL to help Atari add features to a inventory processing system to account for the fact that \"inventory\" intially was items received at the loading dock, fork-lifted to the shipping dock and shipped. So \"inventory\" needed to be booked immediately as sales. Now I dabble mostly with Python and JS/HTML. My memory of the Atari gig was that the most critical part was the CICS code. There was just one guy who knew enough to setup the CICS. If he got hit buy a bus... Well after about a year, the bus would not have mattered. Atari buried millions on unsold carts, and I went from working in a beautiful office complex next to Great America Park, to a windowless basement closet somewhere near Mountain View now making changess because the \"forklift inventory\" version was no longer needed. I know this is a bit off topic, but \"COBOL\" was the into I needed. reply",

The system contained records of all their policies including all the premium factors (e.g. make, model, year of car, parking location, physical address, etc). These premium factors were then fed into a rating engine which would use actuarial tables with custom actuarial defined algorithms to determine premiums. In insurance companies, working out the correct premium is core to everything. Insurance companies can have lots of different products and their competitive edge comes from how well they structure their offerings and determine the correct premiums based on risk factors. One does not simply rewrite such a thing. Couple of things I thought were a bit interesting about the place: - Their single server running Universe Basic (with a hot spare I believe) had 4TB of RAM.\n- While I was used to the devs being the stars of the show at the consulting house I worked at, at insurance companies it’s the actuaries. reply",

          "text": "I think you got most details from the others, but insurance is two basically two different things: Life Insurance is mostly a savings product, and the insurance part protects you if you live too long. Property and casualty insurance protects you from losses, including someone's life, but also houses, cars, etc. The domains are quite different, but they both have specific \"insurance business\" computing that's related to actuarial science or analysis, i.e. the statistics needed to calculate reserves, policies, prices etc. I doubt COBOL is used for any actuarial analysis. I think SAS is still strong, but I suspect R is used now. Maybe Python is used in the more static calculations that are handed over to developers, but the actuaries are typically coding whatever they need when they create their models. The rest is just case management, automating business rules, bookkeeping, payments, and for life insurance also systems for trading securities and funds, and possibly in-house tools for asset management. There isn't really a strong case for COBOL. The only reason COBOL still is used is that the insurance companies where early adopters and saw computing as a way to reduce the administrative overhead. The investments were made at a time when trusting some hippies running UNIX wasn't really on the table, and even less so trusting some nerds and their rickety PCs. They built up a workforce with COBOL devs that also gained quite a lot of business knowledge. The digitalisation created another problem - a lot of the older employees were hired to do simple administrative tasks. Even big corporations aren't totally psychopathic so it actually has taken a long time to shift out the employees, and retrain the remainder for the jobs that got more demanding. Even the employees that didn't really have that much high-value domain-specific knowledge to begin with. So the case for more automation was actually not as strong as it could have been. Even still, although especially life insurance is a totally digital product (damage claims is not), they primarily see IT as a cost centre at heart although they probably claim they do not. This has shaped their systems and they have tended to replace their old systems when they're forced by external factors, as the upsides  - better digital sales, more automated decisions, better trading experience for their customers,etc \nare not as easy to achieve as the more tangible administrative automation cost savings they started out with. Actually, this also applies to banks. You could totally run an insurance company or bank without any mainframes or a single line of COBOL. But the organisations still have COBOL developers and maybe more important an upper management that come from that tradition. reply",

A vote for zeeframe's recommendation of the IBM Z Xplore course. Great stuff. If you're looking for more reading material, I'd suggest the O'Reilly book \"Modern Mainframe Development\" book that covers a range of topics. ( https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/modern-mainframe-d... ) If you're looking for an on-the-job training approach that would enable a career change into the mainframe, Broadcom offers something called the Vitality program ( https://mainframe.broadcom.com/beyondcode/vitality_program ) that runs every year in North America, Europe, and Australia.

Integrations are mostly file based but we do both call and expose APIs (“regular REST APIs”) as well as consuming from and producing to Kafka among other things. We integrate with both mainframe and distributed systems on prem as well as “internal” systems hosted on cloud. We use Git for source control but have a CI/CD solution that is built in house. Quite a lot of other infrastructure is also built in house.

You'd have been hard pressed to tell the difference between those COBOL apps and any VB6 or WPF app on Windows. With embedded SQL, the GUI controls in the SCREEN SECTION, and COBOL p-code and memory management, it was actually a rather nice little 4GL type development system.

The latter really isn't a problem since these systems are usually standalone, but the former does become a problem - they often are from a time where this just wasn't something to consider. As a result, these legacy systems are often using default passwords, have tons of crazy stuff exposed to the network, and are comprised of custom code written specifically for the business purpose (so the documentation is only as good as what they made). On the other hand, these guys generally write pretty neat, lean code that is quick, reliable, and directly responsive to the business. The really fun thing is watching the users fly through the keyboard-only screens, sometimes with muscle memory that is faster than the terminal emulator can update - they're literally working ahead of the screens. reply",

Super handy while reading someone's else code, which is like 90% on large projects. 2. Quick refactorings. Often times I see people discuss in lengths what would/could be instead of just go and try it out quickly, seeing all the pros and cons. Many times I proven myself wrong by trying it out and seeing pitfalls I didn't see earlier. 3. Warnings: so many real bugs could've been prevented if developers had seen (or cared about) to IDE showing a warning. Many PR review suggestions are detectable by a proper IDE without wasting reviewer's time. 4. Hotkeys (what the parent comment was talking about) -- speeds up all of that, especially refactorings, freeing dev's brain for thinking of architecture and other problems. I can go on an on. Sometimes it feels like 50%+ of AI usage for coding is to free up fingers, not knowing that they were already mostly free by using static analysis features/hotkeys. reply",

From a technical-cultural perspective it was mostly sulkiness, and a complete and utter lack of embracing the paradigms of distributed computing. Also, like most internal clouds, there were plenty of issues as it was. Initially they just tried to replace mainframe application components 1:1 onto VMs in whatever way and whenever anything was <100% reliable they complained that our cloud was not able to do it. I had to explain in a very harsh way, under a lot of pressure (I believe not hitting the deadline of switching off the mainframes meant renewal for a year at 40 Mil.. or thereabouts) the realities of \"cloud\". The developers I spoke with in that time though, were very much the opposite of the move fast breaking things crowd. Intelligent, but also narrow minded I would say. reply",

          "text": "I haven't worked in COBOL, but I've worked with it. This was around 1999, and I was building a system for configuring and ordering custom PC's at a large distribution company. One of the feature requirements was that we display inventory over the various options. (ie: There are 373 20G disks in stock, but only 12 30G disks in stock). The idea was that this would let a customer ordering 200 machines know that they should pick the 20G disk if the wanted it now. The way inventory at this company was done was via two systems. There was a normal SQL database that had access to a daily snapshot of inventory taken from a mainframe that always had the up to date data. With the mainframe taking a while to process queries, we used the less current SQL database for the majority of the UI, but took the time to query the mainframe once a customer was in the shopping cart.  Customers might see a change during the flow, but it would at least let them see the most current data prior to committing to a purchase. The mainframe query itself was implemented by someone else as a COBOL job that produced the required inventory numbers.  From my point of view, it was just a limited sort of query conducted over a specialized JDBC driver. (Not necessarily the weirdest aspect of that design.... for a variety of reasons, we did the UI in ASP/VBScript, the back end using Microsoft's JVM invoked via COM Automation, and the SQL database link was via a dubious use of a JDBC/ODBC bridge to connect to SQL Server. It all worked, but not the most solid architecture.) == My only other mainframe experience was working as an intern for a utility company a few years prior (1991-1992). They used CDC Cyber mainframes to run the power grid, using something like 4MM lines of FORTRAN code. The dispatchers themselves interfaced to the system using consoles with 4 19\" color displays running at 1280x1024. Heady stuff for 1991. (The real time weather radar screen was cool too, in an age before the internet made it common place.) reply",

          "text": "I have a friend who works writing COBOL for a US state government, I sent him this post and this was his response: I work in COBOL for government systems. We upgraded our old mainframes to IBM Z16's, and we just got some new ones in recently for our backup server. Part of the job is taking whatever they decide in legislation and translating that into code that processes whatever they decided to make law, from fees, suspensions, special legislation for certain areas, etc. Our programming environment primarily uses TSO/ISPF and changeman for version control. We have access to IBM's IDz (previously RDz) as an IDE for development, and I would personally prefer to use that but haven't been able to get it installed on my work computer due to licensing issues. Part of security protocol is that we cannot use anything open-source, so VSCode with Zowe is, unfortunately, out of the picture. We maintain a lot of old programs and modules, but we are also actively developing new programs as we expand our IT department - and yes, that is new COBOL programs. We have a Linux side as well which mainly deals with the web-side, but they still interact with the mainframe to call on modules - but all they are really doing is sending data to CICS to get data back. They do not know anything about the COBOL itself or how to program in it. reply",

I ended up ditching the usual RAG+embedding route and built a local semantic engine that uses ΔS as a resonance constraint (yeah it sounds crazy, but hear me out). Still uses local models (Ollama + gguf) But instead of just vector search, it enforces semantic logic trees + memory drift tracking Main gain: reduced hallucination in summarization + actual retention of reasoning across files Weirdly, the thing that made it viable was getting a public endorsement from the guy who wrote tesseract.js (OCR legend). He called the engine’s reasoning “shockingly human-like” — not in benchmark terms, but in sustained thought flow. Still polishing a few parts, but if you’ve ever hit the wall of “why is my LLM helpful but forgetful?”, this might be a route worth peeking into.

Then you can get two for $1600, fit them in a full size case, 128GB DDR5 for $300, some Ryzen CPU like the 9900X and a mobo and case and PSU to fill up the rest of the budget. If you want to skimp you can drop one of the GPUs until you're sure you need 48GB VRAM and some of the RAM but you really don't save that much. Just make sure you get a case that can fit multiple full size GPU and a mobo that can support it as well. The slot configurations are pretty bad on the AM5 generation for multi GPU. You'll probably end up with a mobo such as Asus ProArt Also none of this is worth the money because it's simply not possible to run the same kinds of models you pay for online on a standard home system. Things like ChatGPT 4o use more VRAM than you'll ever be able to scrounge up unless your budget is closer to $10,000-25,000+. Think multiple RTX A6000 cards or similar.

I use LLMs every day for random stuff, but not really because I need the output, more because I need to know and understand where it's strengths and weaknesses are. You're not trying to become an overnight expert here. Nobody expects that. But there's this gap right now between what stakeholders think AI can do (basically everything) and what it actually can do. And guess who needs to bridge that gap? As a software engineer part of your responsibility is to advise non-software engineers on what is just now possible with technology, because when a stakeholder comes to you with some wacky idea, you need to be able to judge it and decide on the investment of time the idea might require, or if it's even possible today/now. reply",

That branching tree approach you mentioned — composing prompt→prompt→query in a structured cascade — is underrated genius.\nWe ended up building something similar, but layered a semantic engine on top to decide which prompt chain deserves to exist in that moment, not just statically prewiring them.

Mostly self-taught, but I got quite a bit of employer-provided training and mentoring especially early in my career. I got recruited by a big company while in school, put university on hold and never got around to finishing. I'd have a history degree if I had gone back to school -- programming started as an interest and hobby for me, one that took over all of my spare time in high school and college. My kids (two with degrees, one went to a vocational program) all have jobs, but none of them work in tech or software. I can't imagine trying to get a job today as a junior, especially without a STEM degree. Plenty of employers (or freelance customers) will overlook credentials if the candidate has experience and a reputation, but young people fresh out of school don't have any of that. Employers seem completely unwilling to take a chance on young people eager to work and learn. I get the impression that very few employers put any resources into training or mentoring their programmers, instead they want to hire people who exactly match some checklist or \"skill set\" and fob the screening and interviewing off to HR, recruiters, and now AI. reply",

          "text": "I came here to ask OP if they mean \"without STEM degree\", \"without STEM education\" ... Would physics degree (while STEM, it's supposedly not as close to Software/Tech as math or other types of engineering studies). Loads of such not strictly TECH folks end up in Big Tech as data scientists, as well as programmers. I only have ~25 years of \"work\" experience. I finished electrical engineering/electronics highschool (in parts of Europe you're 18 y/o by the time you finish highschool). And then just as I started with (computers focused) EE College - I also started freelancing. I started making websites/scripts/etc in the early 2000s. It turned into full time contracting, and then even moving countries for \"Software Engineering\" job - all before I finished college. Anyway - although in the last 2-5 years (Covid/Wars/etc) it became less common for companies to accept \"graduates\". My impression is that it's more about hiring freeze in general, than the more recent \"AI makes 100x developers possible\" hype. And by \"graduates\" I've seen both young folks with tech education but 0 work experience, as well as no (complete or at all official) tech education yet self taught and much more \"work experience\" from personal projects, competitions, hackathons. And of course there's also other tech stuff - UX/design, db/net/sys admins and such. reply",

          "text": "I have no degree at all. I’ve been doing software development professionally for around seven years now. Like many, I’ve started programming as a hobby as a child, around 11 or 12. I got pigeonholed quickly into enterprise development, mostly at non tech companies of various sizes. I knew I never wanted to work as a software dev professionally. I had other plans initially that fell through. However I found myself in a situation where my choices were to struggle off of a low skill job or try and break into the industry have a reasonably comfortable life. Of course, even that didn’t work out as expected. I was significantly underpaid (even with local COL/salary data in mind), still at least it was a foot in the door and a full time job. My salary came more in line with what someone would expect in a small city around the time, but still barely at the bottom of that range. Around the time of the COVID glut, I finally landed a six figure job, as well as the closest thing I’ve had to a job ”in tech”. It was pretty decent, but half the company was dumped a year or two later. I didn’t expect to have much of an issue in the market, ignorant of how bad it really was and with the understanding that with my experience I couldn’t be a total pariah. Instead it took over a year to find a new job and that was solely due to nepotism. A little bit into my current job, I realized my career was dead. I don’t keep up with the industry outside my day to day anymore, I’m certainly not keeping up with newer fresher people and to some extend miss that enthusiasm. But it really does not interest me anymore. Rarely the tech and never the product. I’ve thought about leaving before that happens, but I have yet to see a path to something else that I wouldn’t hate just as much. I figure I’ll either die of from stagnation or AI will replace me or lower that value of my work to the point where the money is no longer worth staying reply",

Saw a lot of contracts for something called \"technical writing\" and they often paid much better than other writing work. Figured out that it was basically \"instruction manuals for computer professionals\". Realized it was a good fit. Took a bunch of basic C.S. courses at community college. Family friend got my foot in the door at an IoT startup, but it was really those C.S. classes that persuaded them to give me a try. And the fact that I would work for peanuts. Turned out that I was competent in the work and I really enjoyed programming. A few years later, Google recruited me, and I've been at Google ever since. I technically have an A.S. in C.S. from that community college, but I think my circuitous path fits the \"non-traditional STEM background\" criteria. Computers have been great to me!

          "text": "My history is pretty wack. I have a graduate degree (MFA) in physical performance, and my work history until I was 40 was entirely in theatre: acting, writing, directing, and teaching. (And, you know, waiting tables, and selling shit, and all the other gig-work stuff actors have to do to get by). Thing is, I was always a tech nerd, too. I put up websites for every project I worked on - and plenty for friends, too - going back to the late nineties. I programmed (and sometimes physically repaired) lighting and sound systems. I built plug-ins for lighting and sound software, to solve problems various shows had. I set up networking stacks for a couple of theatres. In 2004 or so I built what was basically Brown Paper Tickets (before Brown Paper Tickets existed) for a theatre company I was working for at the time - backed by an Access database, of all things, running on an old box in the office because that's all we had to work with without paying for it. Later I built effectively MailChimp, to promote my own show. Arguably I should have monetized one or another of those tech projects, and done theatre later, but that was never the point. I enjoyed messing with tech, but didn't want to do any of it, except insofar as it made possible something else I really wanted to do. At 40 I lost my teaching job (enrollment dropped, and arts are always the first to go), and my wife and I didn't want to move, and were thinking of having a family, so I finally sold out. A restauranteur I'd worked a fair bit for in my twenties needed an IT Director for his growing company, and figured I could do it, which it turns out I can. I make three times what I did as a teacher, five or six times what I did in my best year as a working actor, and... Eh. I like my job. I'm pretty good at it, but it's what I'm doing in order to do what I really want to do, which these days is to support my family. I don't recommend my career path to anyone as a way into tech (lol!), and I think our world would be a better place if there were less money in tech, and more in arts and education. reply",

While it was always possible for me to find work before the degree, I have to admit that the work offered was vastly incommensurate with both my actual skill level and my desired compensation. This is much less the case post-degree. In fact I now regularly have to turn down work I frankly feel like I couldn't do as good a job on because I have a language to learn and a citizenship to clinch. I do think this effect would have faded out gradually either way, markets are going to reach equilibrium. But the degree made it happen much faster for me even despite relocating to an entirely foreign job market. I would say get the degree in almost all cases. reply",

          "text": "I'm a self-taught programmer, been coding since I was 12. Went to university for a science degree, but it was my programming skills that ended up being way more useful and lucrative. Worked in various technical roles since I was 18, from data engineering at major research hospital, technical due-diligence for venture capital, startups, ML research, etc. Basically, my degree didn't seem to matter. At the moment, I'm running a program for self-directed CS education[1] and end up talking to a lot of people who were self-taught. Part of the motivation for the program was that we found that people we hired who had a lot of self-directed experiences were much better engineers. It wasn't that degrees were necessarily bad, but it seemed like the thing that made them good was not the degree. From my experience talking to people who were also mostly self-taught, the outcomes are a mixed bag. In retrospect, I think I was quite lucky in that I had the right support structures (mentors, etc) in place throughout my life. Some I worked towards, others kinda fell in my lap. In addition, some of my earlier career/life decisions based on hunches have worked out so far (pivoting from medicine to ML in 2012). Not everyone I talked to had the same experience. Some really languished because they really had no support / positive influences. Others think it's one of the best decisions they've made, in both time/money saved and agency. If I had to summarize, one of the major negatives is that self-directed education frontloads a lot of the problems early on. You're in total control, but also exposed to all your mistakes. If you don't have the right environment, you can flounder in the sense that you don't even know what you're missing. This is compounded by our terrible K-12 education system, which does not prepare you for self-direction. If you don't have other sources of support, it could lead you to a vicious cycle of failure begetting failure. You'll also be \"marked\" [2] and mistakes/setbacks will be attributed to your lack of degree, whether justified or not. From a career perspective, some hiring managers are not incentivized to take risks on non-degree holders. Ie. it could blow back on them if you don't work out. You'll have to work harder on signaling and networking, etc. You're not going \"fit\", esp in a degree-heavy culture, and that could lead to social isolation. The positives is that, at the moment, there's never been a better time to self-direct your education. You end up learning things that interest you, at your pace at the right time, so the problems/work is always relevant. You can go really deep really fast. The people that you want to work for/with don't care about your degree. Self-directed education is inevitable, esp in tech. Every one of us eventually have to take control of our education. The problems you have to work through early on are also inevitable (ex. signaling to others that you are competent). The agency and sense of control is great for your mental well-being and developing accountability. Your team can count on you to take the initiative, figure things out, and learn the things you need to learn. Uncertainty is not paralyzing. You've dealt with it your whole life. Overall, it's not an easy path. I think a lot of it depends on early support and the mental attitude/personality of the individual.

Some may insist that a degree is more common than this narrative suggests, but granted that, it seems there is a weak to nonexistent correlation between technical career success and an advanced degree.

A MCP server is really just a collection of functions the model can call, and a list of those functions and their description/input params. In theory the MCP connector is calling /get-tools on the MCP servers and injecting that into the prompt, so the model knows which tools are available, their description and input params.  It's then up to the model to pick a specific tool to use. I don't know where specifically the MCP tools are injected into the prompt or what the original system prompt is (ie: maybe it's saying \"always give the internal tools priority and only use MCPs if nothing else fits\"). It could be the MCP server has poor descriptions of the tool.  That is what the model uses to decide to use it or not. It could also be the model just sucks.  Claude Opus/Sonnet seem to be some of the best at tool calling, but it's still up to the model to pick which tools to use.  Some models are better than other. Some models start to regress in their tool calling abilities as the context window fills up. My instinct is the MCP tools have bad descriptions.  I've done a bit of reverse engineering of Claude Code and most of the tool descriptions are very detailed.  \"Use this tool to call a bash command\" would be a bad tool description.  The Claude Code bash tool description is 110 lines long containing detailed usage information, when to use it, when not to use it, example usage and etc. It also has a summary at the bottom of very important things (that were just written above in the same description) for the model not to forget (they use the word IMPORTANT and YOU MUST a lot in the prompts/descriptions) reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">It's 2025, and virtualization is still a headache, even for casual use.<p>I use a MacBook Air M1 as my dev laptop, and I just wanted to have a reproducible dev environment running Debian.<p>My options: use devcontainer, or use a VM on Virtualbox, VMWare, Parallels, UTM, etc.<p>VSCode &amp; Typescript gets messed up every now and then, such that they don't work and I simply can't continue with them. Not sure why, but I think there are weird internal bugs in those that surface whenever there is some special combination of circumstances on my machine. With devcontainer I think VSCode still runs directly on my machine but connects to the container, so this is nto a solution for me, I need a real VM.<p>So I try VirtualBox first. After spending hours installing Debian on a VM and getting it running nicely, within a short time the VM slows to a crawl. Nothing I do reliably fixes this. I also cannto get the display resolution to behave properly. I give up on VirtualBox, again (I keep trying this every few years forgetting why I don't use VirtualBox)<p>Next, I want to try VMWare, only to find out it is sold to Broadcom, and when I follow the link to their page, I'm supposed to log in to download, and yet I see no way to register. Oh well.<p>Next, I try Parallels. After getting a Debian VM running on it, I marvel at how smoothly it works. I'm in the trial, but I'm not going to have a problem paying up if everything goes on well. Alas, it was too good to be true. I start to to have random loss of internet connectivity (weirdly affecting the terminal only) in the VM. I see that the default networking mode is shared networking. I read guides online suggesting to switch to bridged networking. After spending oodles of time setting up the firewall and other security configuration on the VM and switching to bridged networking, I'm still having intermittent connectivity issues. it seems they are even worse now. Suddenly I remember again why I don't have a Parallels subscription after all these years.<p>Frustrated, I finally give up. I ruefully remember that UTM also has similar performance and screen display problems as VirtualBox.<p>So what options are left? I can't really physically install a dual-boot Linux on my Macbook (Asahi notwithstanding, since I only want Debian). Maybe I could sign up for a cloud VPS and use that. Or just buy new AMD mini PCs and run Debian on those. Either way, it's clear the virtualization story, after decades of supposed tech advancement, is still a bitter one.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Virtualization has been solved for good, even the cheapest consumer hardware has virtualization support since at least a decade by now and I sometimes run virtual machines on a 4GB netbook with an Atom processor  just for fun. I am running 100% automatically deployed/configured Debian desktops on Apple hardware for several years now, Intel and M1 CPUs. (100% reproducible is another level and another story). Right now and for most of the past years I am running VMWare Fusion, which works with the features I need as long as you don't update macOS immediately after a new major revision was released. (Apple messing up internal APIs nearly every time.) Sometimes in the past I also used the QEMU version provided by macPorts, and the only issue I had was with my non English keyboard, if you use a US keyboard layout you shouldn't have any issues at all. Still, I am surprised, you seem to imply that you need to provision a new VM because of trouble with TypeScript/VSCode? Not sure what you are doing, or what plugins in VSCode you are running, but that I have to provision an entirely new VM to solve such kind of problems never happened to me and I haven't heard about that in my environment (big company, quite a lot of VSCode and TypeScript users). reply",

Just now things are starting to catch up, but there's still a wide gap in features; Apple Virtualization Framework is still very limited. And a personal limitation I hit recently, no USB4/Thunderbolt passthrough anywhere, not in UTM (which uses AVF), not in VMWare either. Also remember the final Apple Silicon version of VMWare supporting M1/M2 wasn't available until November 2022 (it was a tech preview before), while all the Broadcom situation was ensuing. And I think only as of 2024 it runs smoothly. So far it's still the most reliable for desktop Linux VMs for me. Windows 11 for ARM runs very well too, and it does x86 emulation transparently, even 2010s games run well. reply",

          "text": "FWIW, I've used VMWare Fusion on Mac OS for years (and their Workstation product on Linux/Windows since 1999). It has worked well for me so far. VirtualBox used to be not great on MacOS with multiple CPUs and lots of interrupts - I noticed problems when moving from a Mac laptop with a spinning HDD to NVMe SSDs. The slow inter-processor interrupts (IPIs) and some related contention caused concurrent IOs to get very slow with fast SSDs with VirtualBox (back when still running on an Intel Mac with VMWare kernel module). In fact, I could get more IOPS out of the VM with fio when giving just 1-2 vCPUs to the VM, vs 4-8 vCPUs. I haven't tested VirtuaBox on latest Mac versions as I'm happy with VMWare Fusion (also on ARM M1/M2 machines). The product is still good, regardless of Broadcom's business shenanigans. Edit: If Parallels works for you, but only the SSH terminal sessions get stuck, maybe the \"shared network\" connection drops your connections for some reason. Before diving too deep into troubleshooting this across layers, you could try out the usual suspects workaround, setting SSH TCP keepalive. I have this for some connections in my ~/.ssh/config file: TCPKeepalive yes ServerAliveInterval 30 reply",

Are these the same images as used in the paper books? My bet is that the images used for paper books are much higher quality, but I can't compare because in general I don't buy both the paper and epub version.<p>I've seen this in books from different publishers, different languages.

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I launched a free tools site called Kody Tools (https://www.kodytools.com/) almost two years ago as a side hustle. It features over 600 tools, a clean and responsive design, and I invested a lot of effort into promotion. I assumed monetizing with ads or selling ad space would be straightforward.<p>But despite all that, it only pulls in about 7-10k visitors a month, and the revenue is practically zero. Hosting costs me around $20-$40 monthly, making me seriously reconsider my approach.<p>I’m curious to hear how you’d tackle this kind of situation. What worked for you when monetizing a free tools site without driving away users or ruining the experience?<p>Any tips or strategies would be hugely appreciated!</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "This may be a situation where less is more. It might sound good to say there are 600 tools, but no one wants to scroll through a list of 600 things to find what they may want to use. I see that you have a search, but if people are going to search anyway, they’re going to use a search engine. People tend to search for the thing they want to convert, and just pick the first or second result. The URL and SEO are going to matter a lot for this. The most popular things are also being built right into search engines, eating everyone’s lunch. Sites with hundreds of tools are ones I bookmark, but then never go back to, because I usually just search for what I need in the moment, it’s faster than finding a bookmark and hunting to see if a site I have as a tool for it. The only time this might change is if a site has an exceptional design or does things the basic top results don’t have that I really want/need, and it’s something I do often enough for it to matter. I read a story not long ago about a guy who does pretty well with his converter site. It has a single tool, the URL is specific to that tool so it ranks high in the results, and it is something businesses need. This means they are willing to pay, because it saves them enough time to make it worth it, and they are coming back again and again. It wasn’t low hanging fruit though. If I remember correctly it could take in bank statements from bunch of different banks and parse them to pull out the details for some specific business purpose. When the banks changed their format, he’d have to tweak his code to account for it. I see the age calculator is at the top of the popularity list, but a million sites can calculate an age. I just stick date it Wolfram Alpha myself. Most people probably also do this in their head when precision isn’t needed. I think you want to find what other sites don’t do, or do poorly, focus on that, and optimize to show up in search results for people looking for those things. If it’s something a business is willing to pay for, even better. You’d have to be hugely popular to make ads generate enough to matter, and it’s hard to stand out in the converter website market at this stage of the game. reply",

Perhaps it would be better to split out the financial tools (bonds, cagr, interest) from the programmer/text tools stuff. I do actually think online / browser based tools that people hit via search for very occasional  / niche uses is a good idea, e.g.: https://everytimezone.com/ http://gc.kls2.com/ For these, they do non-trivial things, and are also a combination of a tool / logic plus some embedded reference data (timezones / DST, airport locations, etc) - I think that's the key.

Prioritize domain availability under .dev, .io, .tech, .host, or .xyz. Don’t obsess early; names evolve and rebranding is easy. Examples like “Aidev” balance AI-focus and clarity well. Currently, devo.host and aidev.host are available. reply",

Because of the cost, I tried Codex, but after a few simple questions I gave up. Nowhere close to CC when it comes to tool usage. Gemini cli asked for a Cloud project id, no idea what is meant with this. Cursor is not an option because I think long term they can’t compete with the integration that Anthropic can offer. Second, CC offers capabilities you will learn as power user, in that sense it is like a game; addictive. reply",

          "text": "I’ve built multiple RAG pipelines across Windsurf, Claude, and even Gemini-Codex hybrids, and I’ve learned this: Most of the current devtools are competing at the UX/UI layer — not the semantic inference layer. Claude dominates because it \"feels smart\" during code manipulation — but that’s not a model quality issue. It’s that Claude’s underlying attention bias aligns better with certain symbolic abstractions (e.g. loop repair or inline type assumptions). Cursor and Windsurf ride that perception well. But if you inspect real semantic coherence across chained retrievals or ask them to operate across nonlinear logic breaks, most tools fall apart. That’s why I stopped benchmarking tools by \"stars\" and started treating meaning-routing as a core design variable. I wrote a weird little engine to explore this problem: https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY It’s more a semantic firewall than an IDE — but it solves the exact thing these tools fail at: continuity of symbolic inference. tl;dr: The tools that win attention don’t always win in recursive reasoning. And eventually, reasoning is what devs will benchmark. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I don’t use UI-integrated coding assistants; I live in Aider. Mostly on Gemini 2.5 Pro, sometimes o3—after a while you learn which model shines at what.<p>I wanted something more agentic (simple things like edits across repos), and everyone kept hyping Claude Code. So I bit the bullet: signed up for Pro (Sonnet-only).<p>- Loved the agentic behavior—especially for debugging a distributed system (AWS CloudWatch/Lambda/SQS/CloudFormation). That would’ve been a ton of manual copy/paste pain in Aider.<p>- But the “Pro” subscription hit the wall after ~3 hours and Claude told me to wait “a couple of hours.” Disappointing.<p>Upgraded straight to Max, got Opus access. Nice—Opus is good. Sonnet, though, was a disappointment: lots of beginner mistakes I never see with Gemini 2.5 Pro or o3, so it just wastes my time.<p>Then I discovered my Opus quota was gone in under 30 minutes and I had to wait hours or fall back to Sonnet. Paying for something called “Max” and hitting brakes that fast reminded me why I avoid vague quota subs. (Later I learned you can theoretically use Claude Code via metered API, too.)<p>Main takeaways:<p>- Claude Code agent behavior is great (and I didn’t even touch MCP yet).<p>- Sonnet is bad.<p>- Opus is good—but basically unusable on a Max subscription!?<p>Question: Is there anything comparable to Claude Code but more Aider-style so I can plug in whatever LLM? I’ve seen some “hacks” to run Claude Code with other models via wrappers, but they feel half-baked.<p>What are folks using?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",
