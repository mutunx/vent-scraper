It looks like this: https://i.imgur.com/Plk1DQ4.png the calculator is mostly the same for now, with a few improvements.

I was allowed to open source it and I am planning on making it the basis of my PhD research: https://github.com/dahlend/kete It can predict the location of the entire catalog of known asteroids to generally within the uncertainty of our knowledge of the orbits.

          "text": "Working on a browser extension to make it easier to find content on YouTube that fits your interests. I watch a lot of YouTube videos and have found it very annoying that YouTube latches onto one or two topics that you've watched and only recommends that type of content over and over again. Even if you use their \"Not Interested\" tool, not a whole lot changes in your recommendations. At the end of last year I launched Relevant - a crowdsourcing website where users can categorize the channels they watch into a defined hierarchy of categories ranging from broad topics like \"Science\" and \"Gaming\" to more specific ones like \"Phone Reviews\" or \"Speedrunning\". Although I've had good feedback on the website, engagement has been relatively low and I think that's because it's a big ask to have someone navigate to the website to find the content. This year I decided that I'd bring the content to them by making a Chrome extension that lets users interact with Relevant directly from within YouTube. It's still a work in progress but I'd love to get a first version out within a month or so to start spreading the idea and gathering feedback. If this is of any interest to the people here on HN then please let me know what you'd like to see most on your feeds. https://relevant.watch/ reply",

          "text": "A tree cutting tool. Take photos of the tree from 6 different angles, feed into a 3D model generator, erode the model and generate a 3D graph representation of the tree. The tool suggests which cuts to make and where, given a restricted fall path (e.g. constrained by a neighbors yard on one side). I create the fallen branches in their final state along the fall plane, and create individual correction vectors mapping them back to their original state, but in an order that does not intersect other branch vectors. The idea came to me as a particularly difficult tree needed to come down in my friends yard, and we spent hours planning it out. I've already gotten some interest from the tree-surgeon community, I just need to appify it. Second rendition will treat the problem more as a physics one than a graph one, with some energy-minimisation methods for solving. reply",

          "text": "Last month, I started playing around with code sandboxes and how LLMs might interface with them and wrote a little blog post about it [1]. I then took the code and vibe coded my way to a multi-tenant (untested!) sandboxing server that lets you run arbitrary Docker containers and provides a simple HTTP interface and UI. A cute, novel idea is that you can fork containers easily, as seen in the video in my repo: https://github.com/ammmir/sandboxer It may not be useful, but it's been fun, and I've honed my gut-level experience in Docker, Podman, Linux namespaces, Checkpoint/Restore, CRIU, and more. The ultimate goal is to hand each AI agent iteration a sandbox of its own (forked from the previous iteration), and have it build apps in private sandboxes. You'll be able to view intermediate progress as the app is being built (or failed rabbit holes), since each sandbox gets a unique URL automatically. Like, imagine if each commit of your git repo had its own URL to preview the app! [1] https://amirmalik.net/2025/03/07/code-sandboxes-for-llm-ai-a... reply",

On top of that, it uses a lightweight AI model to read product descriptions and filter based on things like ingredients (e.g., flagging peanut butter with BPA by checking every photograph of the plastic or avoiding palm oil by reading the nutrition facts) or brand lists (e.g., only showing WSAVA-compliant dog foods).

I've been using AI to get smaller examples and ask questions and its been great but past attempts to have it do everything for me have produced code that still needed a lot of changes. I hit an OpenSearch bug this week where you can't get any browser based requests to work. Its due to zstd becoming a standard part of Accept-Encoding and OpenSearch not correctly supporting it so I wanted to install a browser plugin that modified the browser HTTP request headers to my servers. I don't know about everyone else but I love that browser plugins are possible but I hate having to find them. Its mostly due to never knowing if you can trust a plugin and even if you find one, you have to worry about it being bought out in the future. With vibe coding I was able to build a browser extension in 45 minutes that had more features than I originally planned for. I spend more time documenting the experience than building which is wild. If you are interesting you can look at the README in https://github.com/mattheimer/vibe-headers But I left the experience with two thoughts. Even seasoned developers will be using vibe coding in the future. I think in the near future the browser plugin market will partially collapse because eventually browsers will build extensions themselves on the fly using natural language. reply",

On one hand it’s interesting, because it’s very different from the dayjob. But doing it by myself pays my newish car in cash immediately. However I wouldn’t do it for money somewhere else, it’s really really hard work. Instead of masonry I would like to work on time of flight cameras. But the day has only 24 hours :-( reply",

          "text": "I've always been into MUDs since the mid-90s and every now and then I get this idea to write one from scratch (again) and I get pretty far and then I lose interest. The new one is browser based. The mud engine runs in a web worker and takes advantage of some of the modern web tricks to do stuff. For instance, data files (think: area files that don't change often) can be stored remotely and then cached with a service worker. This allows the MUD to run offline. But that's only fun if you're playing solo. IO between the UI and worker is handled by message passing. Multiplayer is handled by the MUD opening an outbound connection (probably websocket) to a connection collector host. Other players would then connect to that host and have their IO routed appropriately. The host can even be smarter: it could be a specialized Discord client, allowing users to play from there. Firebase may also be involved. I don't know. The important bit is that this is still basically message passing, so the engine won't need to know the difference between the local user and a remote user. The MUD database would be an IndexedDB. Probably. I haven't thought as much about that yet. I am sure all of this is theoretically possible, at least. reply",

For my Dutch (which was probably once a high B2, now probably a low B1) I only use the audio review when walking my dog or cooking. It plays the audio of the cards in a playlist, so I practice hearing and repeating them. It's not so self serve at the moment, but if you get in touch I can get you up and running. reply",

Can we not just have a \"search your language\" field? 2. I need to see what the app actually looks like, how it proposes it'll teach me. I'm one of the eager-to-pay people, because Duolingo is frankly dogshit (ok. Mostly polite) at teaching languages (doubly so ones that it doesn't care about like Hungarian).

          "text": "Thanks for the feedback! I agree with you completely. 1. I just started the marketing website a few weeks ago, and if you can believe it, I didn't readily have that information. One of my tasks last week was to compile a list of languages that could work, write some tests for all of the languages, and get a list of supported languages. I have that list now, I just need to put it on the marketing page. 2. As mentioned in other comments, I'm working on a video. I'm preferring to fix glaring issues before making the video, although at this point I'm verrrrrrry close. I have started scripting it, but it takes a lot of time to make a good video (1-2 full days if I don't want to edit it). Your feedback is completely valid, and they're both reasons why I'm not really marketing the product yet. This thread seemed like a good middle ground though as having some people using all the languages would be really helpful. Also, I've genuinely been loving using it and want to share. It's just me working on it, so these things are coming, but everything takes a while! Hopefully these didn't sour you on the project permanently :) EDIT: And yes, it supports Hungarian :) reply",

          "text": "I was self taught for 10 years in the field and found a program that offers a Master's degree with work experience accounting for the undergrad. I didn't take calculus or stats in my undergrad and that has caused some headaches in completing the degree, but the amount of stuff I was exposed to in such a short period of time was incredible. Very quickly into the program I was stuck by just how unethical it was for me, with no experience and certification to make guarantees and promises to an employer who didn't know better. In most fields the knowledge worker could be held liable for making this kind of \"contract\" (think lawyers, electricians, doctors, etc.). You can be driven and motivated. You might have learned a ton on your own. You cannot know what you don't know. People in these comments will trip over each other to explain that education is subjective and you won't use any of that stuff in the real world. They have stories about wasted classes and dusty academics. The reality is much more boring. * Lectures are very effective ways of provide a curated bit of information. * Structured practice and verification (homework and grades) are quick ways to ensure that the start of learning has occurred. * Working with your peers will likely expose strengths and weaknesses in your existing understanding of the subject matter. This often helps everyone involved. * Reading academic publications and textbooks helps to standardize the shared understanding of the subject and ensures that future efforts to expand the field or solve hard problems are more effective. You said in your post that you're not sure where to go with your career and your opportunities aren't evident to you --- go to school and give yourself some deeper knowledge. It'll help you figure out how to navigate the field. reply",

His friend looks at the stack and asks him \"how are you going to decide among all those?\" The man grabs half the stack, throws it in the garbage and says \"Simple, I don't hire unlucky people\". Degrees matter when employers don't have the time and/or ability to make a reasonable decision for every candidate. They need ways to eliminate chunks of the applications. Illogical ways of eliminating candidates are acceptable because they are better than having no way. One method that's not completely illogical is to only look at candidates who have degrees. You can get degrees for <15K. For a BSCS you can do WGU for 5/10K. For a MSCS you can do GaTech OMSCS for 7K. Those numbers are small enough that they're almost definitely worth it. But those also cost time, which you will have to decide for yourself if you want to spend. reply",

          "text": "I think you should ask yourself two related but separate questions: 1. Will the CS degree increase your knowledge and problem-solving ability faster than you could without it? 2. Will the credential add substantially to your credibility for hiring managers? The answer to 1 is mostly about your level of self-discipline and ability to learn independently. If you need the stimulus of a structured environment and a peer group to learn at your best, then any accredited program will be helpful, and your ability to pass coding interviews will increase (with a lot of hard work beyond the curriculum). The answer to 2 is pretty straightforward: unless your degree is from a tier 2+ school, the raw credential is of little value, and even tier 2 is not certain. To count, an online degree must be presented by the school as competitive with an on-site degree. Georgia Tech offers such a degree program as a tier 1 school, for example. An unaccredited program is of no value whatsoever in answer to 1 or 2. So, avoid them at any price. You are looking at a 3-5 year project, no matter what, and this is probably a good time to do that. The market will take that long to sort itself out and to realize that vibe coding is NOT the miracle it seems. reply",

When you make statements like that, or prognostications of that nature, you have to think about how it actually is in reality and not as the kinds of base opinions that are found in Reddit CS careers subs. I think this varies widely for employers and even within teams of large employers, depending on who is the person doing the hiring. Even at a simplistic level having a degree from a regionally accredited institutions will decide whether you pass the first HR screen, so it cannot be equivalent to no credential at all. This just fails a basic real world sensibility test. Are you saying a CS grade from Montana State University that is a hiring manager at FAANG (maybe even the most famous one) is going to consider someone with a degree from Stevens or Florida Institute of Technology to be equivalent to someone without a degree? I don't know if you are aware but there many people employed CS grads that did not attend the top 3. Also, I don't know about tiers, but these rankings are largely based on research and not quality of undergraduate program or outcomes. The idea of telling someone that doesn't have a degree that wants to know of if attaining a degree could likely help their career that they should not go if it is not \"tier 2+,\" whatever that is, is just kind of malpractice.  Georgia Tech is not the only school that offers such a degree that is equivalent to their in-person program. I would agree that you should choose a school that has a traditional program for which this online program is just a different modality, rather than one of these online-only predatory type of schools. reply",

Words are indirect references to ideas and ideas are like raw marble in your head, carved into meaningful shapes by working with and manipulating those ideas.

          "text": "As someone who has interviewed candidates for a FANG company in the distant past I can't say that degrees matter, but I can say that people I interviewed with degrees generally did better. There's a hidden bias in that this is only people who got through recruiters and recruiters are their own filter. Strong referrals usually guaranteed a phone screens. I think previous experience at a major competitor in the same tier or a degree from a top CS school were also meaningful, but I don't know how else they filtered. There is a non trivial relationship between colleges and businesses, so you are likely to do many problems in college that are not terribly different from the interview questions. Additionally all of your peers have been interviewed/do interviews/do referrals and that does matter. College students generally did not do incredibly well on practical problems, so I would expect a non college candidate to do really well on them. Many of the best co-workers that I remember had physics degrees. In fact, it was so pronounced I personally consider a physics degree to be a top tier signal of programming ability, but that's my own personal prejudice. If your degree isn't from a top 10-20 CS school it's probably not worth it if you have experience. If you can't make friends while doing the courses, then I don't think it's worth it. Going to a good college is much much much much more than a few lectures, some book reading, and some assignments. It is face to face time with world class experts, it's a culture, it's social, it's exploratory. You can potentially work on bleeding edge research or be introduced to things you never knew existed. It sounds like your idea of what college is, is that it's a technical education rather than a liberal education. If that's true I think your perception of college is wrong. There are some situations where a college degree really matters. If you want to apply for a work visa in a foreign country, a degree from a good college can potentially get your application a rubber stamp or lack of one could completely restrict you from it. reply",

I observed this while studying Electronic Engineering, which I would say is similar but more practical and with lower entrance requirements. I'm not sure where computer science would fit into this as it's a newer discipline with less stringent core requirements. Other IT courses may be less rigorous and include people that are less focussed on their education relatively.

          "text": "In my experience, math majors can do some pretty incredible acrobatics (in a good way), but their documentation, systemic performance awareness, and overall design sense often lag behind. These are things they usually pick up outside of the degree, and they have to break some bad habits learned during it (e.g.,  single-character-variable soup). I agree with a sibling comment that physicists often seem to make the best coders, for some reason. My hypothesis: it's because physicists are rigorously trained to model real-world systems directly. What would be considered an \"advanced\" modeling problem to most would be an intro problem to a physics student. Math is absolutely related, but I think the secret ingredient is \"mathematical maturity\" — the ability to fluidly jump between layers of abstraction. Mathematicians are good at this too, but physicists go a step further: they are trained to ground their abstractions in concrete physical phenomena. Mathematicians ground systems in axioms, sure. But physicists have to tether models back to reality — to processes and measurements — which turns out to be exactly the skill set that makes for good programmers and system designers. Huge generalization, obviously. But personally, I've noticed my own programming ability increases the more physics I learn. Physics gives you a systematic framework to reason about complexity — and physicists get the luxury of a \"relatively simple\" universe compared to fields like chemistry or biology. They're working with rich systems described by just a few tightly-coupled parameters. And the kicker: a lot of those systems are 100% repeatable, every time . That kind of structure — and the habit of respecting it — is priceless for engineering. reply",

By this point I've got over 16 years of experience I think, and I don't even bother listing much about my education other than having a BA and the university I got it from. If you're thinking about doing something else to have some variety on the resume, authoring and maintaining an open source library, or becoming a contributor or maintainer of one is always a nice addition to the resume. Unlike getting a degree, it's free to do (time aside) and can show a different kind of experience than you might be getting now through freelancing. reply",

          "text": "I'll share my own story and try to answer your question in that context. I was working as an underwriting assistant at an insurance company and became interested in landing a job as a software engineer. I took a Visual Basic class in high school and a Java class in college. I dropped out of a biology degree late during my second year of college. I managed to get a job at my company's IT helpdesk, supporting a specific application on a level 2 team. I did a 6 month coding bootcamp for node/react, which I left feeling like I had a good baseline in coding ability. While working on the IT helpdesk, I built a webapp that allowed external insurance agents to submit tickets online by integrating with our ticket system API, but I still couldn't get an interview for a dev gig. I eventually asked an internal recruiter why I was never hearing back, and they stated that they were only interested in hiring straight from our college hire program. I was pretty crushed. Out of the blue, six months after coding bootcamp ended, a project manager whom I had known in the past asked me if I'd be interested in a SQL-heavy systems analyst job. I happily took that, and while on the job, I did some internal instructor-led Java training. While I was an analyst, I was able to start taking on some small pieces of work on a Spring Java backend. I was able to get employed as an engineer on my team after working a little over a year as an analyst. I am currently working on finishing up a dual Comp Sci and Math degree. This is to better my long term job safety and career prospects. I am going at a pace where my entire degree will be paid for by my company, without me fronting any money. Ultimately I was able to get employed as an engineer having done a coding bootcamp without a degree, but I think that was only possible because: - I was well networked at my company and maintained relationships over years with prior colleagues - I had substantial domain experience, in insurance, in my company's systems, its business processes, etc - I developed a career path that spanned multiple steps to get to engineer, with each role building on the prior I don't think I would have been able to get employed as an engineer outside my company without some in-between steps reply",

          "text": "I started my professional career without a degree a long time ago. I did a few years of Comp.Sci. (and math) but didn't finish. I then finally got the extra credits to finish years later so I'm a proud bachelors of compute science (it did feel good the decades ago when I completed it). Once I had real experience getting a job was not a problem. That said, getting some specific job at a specific company might be hindered by not having a degree (or even not having a CS degree). I would say: - A degree in Comp.Sci. is useful for what you learn not just for the paper. - Sometimes the paper matters. Some companies will only hire people with a degree. Others you'd need to be a superstar to work around that requirement. - Sometimes the degree can impact your pay. E.g. if you work for the government or a university. - A degree can impact things like immigration. E.g. it's much easier for me as a Canadian to work in the US because my degree means I can get a TN. Some countries will give preference to immigrants with degress. - You can meet interesting people and make connections during your studies. reply",

You could consider studying something completely different. Or you can use the vast resources online to learn something new (e.g. Coursera?) and see what you think. AI could be changing a lot of what we do as well. I wouldn't spend time and money on something that's iffy. A real science bachelors degree is at least 3 years of fairly hard work. You could do that part-time over a longer period. That's not going to necessarily make you a great programmer - a lot of that is just doing it and learning. Which you don't need a degree or a bootcamp for. But it's going to be somewhat limiting not to understand the \"science\" part, how much depends on the specific role. I work with someone who got a diploma, got hired, is doing great, and also going back to school to finish his degree part-time. I also studied part remote part on site to finish the courses I needed while having a full time job and other responsibilities. It's tough but doable. reply",

          "text": "In the AAA games industry, a portfolio speaks much louder than a degree. Junior software engineers with five simple, well-coded games (such as Asteroids, Lunar Lander, etc) on GitHub stand head and shoulders above people fresh out of university without a portfolio in the recruitment process. Senior software engineers with experience developing large AAA titles are in much higher demand than those with a PhD in game systems, such as AI or networking, which is practically non-competitive. So I'd say the degree doesn't matter, at least in this corner of software engineering. I entered the gaming industry a long time ago as a software engineer without a computer science degree. Later, I thought I'd get one online, just as you are considering. It was reasonably cheap compared to my income, and I thought I had the extra hours for an evening online course. But I found it to be very demoralizing. I'd be micro-optimizing containers in AAA game engines, shaving microseconds off operations by reducing CPU cache misses on target consoles in the morning, and earning a 60% grade on my JavaScript game in the afternoon, because I didn't follow the method shown in class. I also did poorly in CS math, especially with formal proofs, which were a lot of fun for math enthusiasts but grating for me, being an expert in game math and graphics math at the time. When my fourth semester rolled around, I found only one or two modules to be somewhat useful, while others, such as HTML web design, had no bearing on my profession. I dropped out about halfway through my degree, leaving me with a lot of money spent but nothing to show for it. I could have forced myself through it, but it would have been on pure discipline (which is easier for some than it is for me!) My advice is: don't get a CS degree because it's doable. Get it if you need it for something, like if you wish to enter a specific industry that requires a meaningful academic experience, such as research. Your degree will then serve a purpose. Otherwise, you might feel like you're not getting much out of it, and it won't be easy to justify carrying through. Especially if you're already performing at a level significantly higher than what a degree puts you on. Or maybe the purpose a degree could serve for you is fun - perhaps the academics would be rewarding for you in a way that doesn't have to flow into your work, or you get networking opportunities that a good uni/college affords. But my view is: it's a significant commitment, so there has to be a meaningful, clear reason to do it. Otherwise, it will be all cost and no return. reply",

At the moment, I feel like a degree is necessary for any job I would want to get given the job market. Call it future proofing if you will. reply",

There was a lot of 'theory vs practice' snobbery where the former was emphasized above all, to the point of absurdity. Get ready to learn the secret knowledge of academia CS like that that functional languages are secretly the solution to everything - especially purely functional - no variables or even mutable state. And of course the secret to writing bug proof programs is to mathematically prove them - just ignore the fact you're simply kicking the can to new bugs, and the domain of programs you can realistically prove is minuscule. I would not hire 95% of my graduating peers. You're not going to enjoy your time. If you were going to get a degree I'd get it in something where computer science is applied rather than the 'thing' itself - e.g. electrical engineering (or even aerospace depending on your mathiness). Also that's probably far more future proofed than a CS degree anyhow, and will get your feet in the door for degree requirements as well as open the door to lots of options that a CS degree wouldn't. reply",

However, I've found that recruiting really differs based on studio size. Indies tend to take what the can get, often forming a ragtag team of people with various levels of education and experience. AAA studios, on the other hand, are very discerning when it comes to programmers.

For reference, when I graduated college back in 2015 I had a portfolio of games, a successful and reasonably popular game mod and a bunch of relevant classwork.

Also of note, many software companies force you to sign an assignment of inventions agreement or a declaration that says you will not work in anything remotely related to software in your free time, which heavily restricts your ability to add to your portfolio. What did help me however, is that I got a job at a smaller company working on software and then leveraged that professional experience into a job in the industry. That initial job I got was because of my computer science degree. The importance of a CS degree was the stuff I learned across the degree, not stuff that was necessarily directly CS-related.

Basically set a goal that sounds crazy to achieve, something that would require an unreasonable amount of effort and time, and then go do it and publicize it. Note that getting a degree is difficult and time-consuming, but not really very unusual or impressive. 2. Interact with real people in technology as much as possible. Not just \"networking\", but actually immersing into the tech community, learning all the events and meetups and hackathons and doing as much of that as possible. Note that a degree will probably help you meet a lot of other students, but not necessarily active tech professionals. As with all challenging goals, my real goal would be to spend a certain amount of time on them every day, taking whatever the next step is. I am quite confident that if you put as much effort into this path as you would a degree, you will land a better job, sooner than the other way. reply",

I'm not going to worry about getting the owl perfect right away. Maybe next week I'll get super into owl feet, and the week after into learning good drawing posture. At some point I'll definitely be attending some meetup of nature-drawing enthusiasts. I'm going to combine a general direction with a lot of time and horsepower and exploration and I will end up with a great owl drawing at the end. The odds are that I end up drawing the owl after only a few weeks because it's not as hard as I thought, but I discover some other really cool goals with a better payoff by then. There's a lot of alpha in spending an unreasonable amount of time on interesting goals. To answer your questions directly: > How will an otherwise relative newcomer know what would be considered challenging Just pick something that sounds challenging to you! You will learn a lot about what the scene considers challenging/interesting as you go. You can always update the goal. > how to go about making it happening Research. Start with stupid questions about the parts that are initially apparent. Keep a list of things that you don't know how to even begin to tackle, and over time, deep dive into items on the list. You will find that the resources/tricks/approaches you have grows as you go. > and that they can make it happen? You just have to really, really believe in yourself and in what you're trying to do.

          "text": "From my experience when I lived in Europe, the following is important to get a job in IT: - Degree, a general one is good, a specific one related to the job is better (especially in the German-speaking area, I don't know about the others) - Experience, especially in well-known big companies They used a trick there to reduce the leverage of employees in IT and created the myth of a \"shortage of skilled workers\" by repeatedly publishing this in various media, creating fake statistics and ghost job ads. A lot of foreigners jumped in and also the existing workforce, afraid of losing their jobs or not finding a new one, didn't bother to negotiate well anymore and are doing jobs for really bad money (e.g. 50k/year). Now you add the \"AI will replace you anyway\" mantra, which initially increases this fear and the willingness of employees to work for low wages. The effect is a workforce that is well educated and willing to work for food and shelter, no questions asked. If you're trying to compete, a degree helps, but in the end you may be undercut by someone with the same degree (with better grades) but who takes less money because they don't know their worth. My opinion: try to get out of Europe, run your own business or find a different career / business opportunity. These are bad times for CS employees in Europe. reply",

Maybe why JBlow refuses to release his beta to the public. Actually, it can be a good thing for the language, by people filing bug reports (so they can get fixed) or to do a PR (if they are at that level). That way, the language has more vetting, from more eyes on it. reply",

I feel like my biggest struggle is simply how hard (tedious?) it is to properly work with generics and some more complex applications of traits. Any time I am working with (especially writing, somehow reading is easier) these, I always take an ungodly amount of time to do anything productive. I am almost certainly sure this is a skill issue -- I am simply not \"Rusting\" like I am supposed to. Maybe I overuse generics, maybe I rely on traits too much, maybe I am trying to abstract stuff away too much. But this is one of the reasons I want to also explore other languages in the space, especially ones which make it impossible for me to make this so complex. Don't get me wrong -- all of this complexity is a joy to work with when I can use my brain. But sometimes, it's just too much effort to do stuff, and it feels like I could be getting away with less. Curiously, I never had a problem with the borrow checker, even though people often complaining about how much it forces them to \"stop and think\". Another thing is that C, for some weird reason, always feels \"lower level\" than Rust, and seeing it gives me some sort of weird satisfaction that Rust does not. Maybe it's just a greener grass syndrome, but wanted to mention it nonetheless. All this said, I want to just emphasise, that despite this shortcoming (if it even is one), if I were forced to choose a language to spend the rest of my life with, I would not be the least bit sad to only ever use Rust again.

Is this related to the problem where, if you want to put a generic in a data structure (e.g. an implementation of `Write`), you find yourself propagating a generic bound up an entire hierarchy of data structures and functions using those structures? Asking because one thing that's common amongst Rust developers is a bit of an aversion to using `dyn Trait` types, and using a `Box<dyn Write>` (for instance) in the right place can wildly simplify your program. > But sometimes, it's just too much effort to do stuff, and it feels like I could be getting away with less.

Maybe it's just a greener grass syndrome, but wanted to mention it nonetheless. I was originally a C developer, and I can sympathize.

That doesn't only apply to languages that offer fewer guarantees than Rust, but also to languages that are possibly less low-level (e.g. OCaml, Nim).

To me that suggests that if a low-level language wants to be more popular than C++, it should focus on low-level programming and shouldn't try to also be a good applications programming language (as C++ has tried to do that, but the overall market share of C and C++ is lower now than it was in, say, 1990), but I could be wrong about that. reply",

That means proving properties of your code, implying Rice's theorem. It doesn't. Rice's theorem talks about the undecidability of proving some arbitrary property of arbitrary programs, but given a property, one can construct a language in which it trivially holds for all programs in the language. This is done by finding an inductive invariant -- one that is preserved by all program operations -- that implies the property. Let me give you an example. Due to Rice's theorem, it is undecidable whether or not the output of an arbitrary program that yields a number output is even. Nevertheless, it's easy to construct a language (even a Turing-complete one) where this property always holds. We find a stronger invariant -- all numbers in the program are even -- that can be easily made inductive. Indeed, even numbers are closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication, while for every division operation we add a runtime check that panics if the result is odd (and, of course, the compiler rejects any literal that isn't even). And voila! Not every program that yields an even output can be written in this language, but every program in this language yields an even output. To see that this is what Rust does with memory safety, note that while every program in safe Rust is memory-safe, not every memory-safe program can be written in safe Rust. > If it's easy (doable) to go 100% memory safe, then there should be a trivial way to always rely on memory guarantees. No need for a spectrum. The need for the spectrum arises because we want to sacrifice 100% memory-safety for other things, such as Java's ability to call C code. > The spectrum exist because rather than writing OS in Ada, programmers collectively decided to bury their heads into C. As someone who wrote safety-critical avionics software in Ada in the nineties, I can tell you that we had good reasons to largely abandon Ada. > an example of Nirvana fallacy. But it isn't because you assume that a language that makes more guarantees will always produce more correct programs per unit of effort, but we know that to be false . From the vantage point of ATS and Idris, a language like Rust is almost indistinguishable from C. There are a few more properties it guarantees than C does, but ATS/Idris can be used to guarantee any program property. If what I said is a nirvana fallacy, then you must not use Rust and always use ATS, because it is much better on your definition of better. The reason we don't is that we know more sound guarantees are not always better, but we didn't always know that. In the seventies, software correctness researchers (such as Tony Hoare) assumed that the only path to scaling software would be soundness (proofs, and even formal proofs). As time went on, we learnt that this belief was false from both sides: unsound methods proved surprisingly effective [1], and proofs proved costly to scale, to the point that they made achieving a required level of correctness more costly. > If you avoid things that are hard, you'll never grow. If a programming language you learned didn't cause headaches, it's not a programming language, it's a dialect. The problem is not in learning new languages. The problem is that more sound guarantees can sometimes reduce the cost of correctness and sometimes increase it. Don't get me wrong: Soundness and proofs sometimes work very well, but we in the software correctness/formal methods world know that things are much more complicated than \"more soundness more better\".

I am not talking about Rust in particular. I'm talking about your general point that more soundness is always better, and your claim that my argument is an example of a nirvana fallacy because I compare an imperfect solution to a hypothetical perfect one. I am trying to explain that we know that more soundness is sometimes worse for correctness in practice. The problem is not that more soundness isn't perfect, but that there are currently better solutions than more soundness in some situations. You seem to be unaware of the shift in software correctness since the seventies. The gap between the size of programs we can prove correct using deductive methods (currently ~10KLOC) and the size of programs produced in industry is only growing. That is why there's been a shift from deductive proofs to methods such as concolic testing (e.g. KLEE). You can see that by looking at the programs for any software verification / formal methods conference. To be clear, I am not saying that more soundness is never better; I'm saying it is sometimes worse. You can say that we should use ATS more, but the effort of producing software that's proven correct with ATS is not justified by the additional correctness guarantees you gain.

I was giving an example of how we make undecidable properties trivial in languages. It can be any property. It's easy to see that Rust does the same with memory safety, i.e. through an inductive invariant, because every statement in Rust maintains the invariant. > Yes, but it relies very little on human verification. Of course. It shouldn't rely on human verification at all. That's how we design type systems. But because an inductive invariant is inherently conservative and must reject correct programs, there is additional human effort required -- not to verify the property, but to stay within the confines of the inductive invariant. In Rust terms, the compiler takes care of memory safety, but you need to put an effort into expressing memory-safe programs in Rust to fit within Rust's constraints, which are, necessarily more restrictive than memory safety (because they must use an inductive invariant). > And I'm saying it as a programmer field we should monotonically approach the ideal by removing languages that don't support it. And I'm saying that what we've learnt over the past five decades is that more soundness does not necessarily mean getting closer to the ideal. Sometimes more soundness gets us further away from the ideal. > Also seatbelts are sometimes worse, doesn't mean we shoud abolish them for seatbelts-less Pintos. No one is suggesting that, it's just that what you're referring to as seatbelts could sometimes do more harm than good even for safety. We have empirical evidence that real seatbelts increase safety; things are nowhere near as clear for language soundness. Sure, C is so exceptionally weak that we can do better than that, and there's no doubt Rust is better on correctness than C, but that's not the same as saying Rust is better on correctness than any language that makes fewer guarantees than Rust. Why? Because, again, we've seen that the benefits of soundness are not linear -- they help until they start hurting. Knowing where that point is is not easy. reply",

For memory management you can choose between ARC/ORC and/or manual. It has two downsides though: small community, and the BDFL can sometimes be rough to interact with. ¹ https://0xc0ffee.netlify.app/osdev I, too, have been looking for a unicorn systems programming language, but it doesn't exit yet. Here's what I looked at so far (only languages that don't rely on a GC): - C: lots of UB, less safe (memory- and type-wise) - C++: too complex, not a big fan of OO - Rust: too complex, gets in the way when writing mostly unsafe kernel code - Zig: Good, but syntax is too noisy; lacks interfaces/dynamic dispatch - Swift: Doesn't have a good bare metal story - D: Seems interesting, I may be looking at it (although need to use betterC mode, i.e. not all language features) - Odin: Game programming focused, small but growing community - Ada: Strong candidate, but it has too much ceremony - Pony: I like the capabilities model, but tiny community - Hare: Also tiny community, lacks polymorphism - Hylo (Val): Experimental (mutable value semantics), too immature - Vale: Experimental (regional memory management), seems stalled - V: Good candidate, but mixed reviews on its claims vs. reality - Austral: Experimental (linear types), tiny community, not much progress - Jakt: Built for Serenity OS, not sure if it's getting enough attention - Jai: Focused on game programming, good reviews, but currently closed source (beta) - Mojo: (Python-like) Seems very interesting and I'd give it a try, but too focused on GPU/parallel programming; also too early for adoption reply",

While those research-kernels certainly do bring a-kind-of-CLR into the kernel it's far from being like the CLR in .NET; but they don't use C# - at least, not the same C# you use in Visual Studio: those research kernels: Singularity, Midori and Verve - used not only the Sing# and Spec# extensions to C#, they had their own compiler (Bartok) which itself enabled other language-extensions. That said, those extensions are fascinating reads: Sing# concerns message-passing ( https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/... ) Spec# added Ada-style (i.e. compiler-enforced) invariants and pre/post-conditions (this was the basis for the Code Contracts feature which was annoyingly/tragically killed-off during the .NET Core reboot in 2016); see https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/spec/ Bartok: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/... reply",

          "text": "IMHO there is neither baseline nor “enough” when it comes to learning any programming language for any reasonably complex domain. As you already know, C/C++ helps with low level software layers that interface with or manage hardware resources. In my experience, Go and Rust are also pretty much used as systems programming languages. For example, I use Go and EBPF to instrument systems calls on Linux kernel. For me, most of my learning came from solving problems and building for specific use-cases. I think getting into builder mode and creating some cool will definitely accelerate your learning. reply",

          "text": "\"Tell me about the Marathon crater.\" This works against _the LLM proper,_ but not against chat applications with integrated search. For ChatGPT, you can write, \"Without looking it up, tell me about the Marathon crater.\" This tests self awareness. A two-year-old will answer it correctly, as will the dumbest person you know. The correct answer is \"I don't know\". This works because: 1. Training sets consist of knowledge we have, and not of knowledge we don't have. 2. Commitment bias. Complaint chat models will be trained to start with \"Certainly! The Marathon Crater is a geological formation\", or something like that, and from there, the next most probable tokens are going to be \"in Greece\", \"on Mars\" or whatever. At this point, all tokens that are probable are also incorrect. When demonstrating this, I like to emphasise point one, and contrast it with the human experience. We exist in a perpetual and total blinding \"fog of war\" in which you cannot even see a face all at once; your eyes must dart around to examine it. Human experience is structured around _acquiring_ and _forgoing_ information, rather than _having_ information. reply",

You ask them to build a flying submarine and by God they'll build one, dammit! They'd dutifully square circles and trisect angles too, if those particular special cases weren't plastered all over a million textbooks they ingested in training. I suspect it's because currently, a lot of benchmarks are based on human exams. Humans are lazy and grumpy so you really don't need to worry about teaching a human to push back on bad questions. Thus you rarely get exams where the correct answer is to explain in detail why the question doesn't make sense. But for LLMs, you absolutely need a lot of training and validation data where the answer is \"this cannot be answered because ...\". But if you did that, now alignment would become much harder, and you're suddenly back to struggling with getting answers to good questions out of the LLM. So it's probably some time off. reply",

Still, let's start with the ideal case: PV=nRT\" > you really don't need to worry about teaching a human to push back on bad questions A popular physics textbook too had solid Argon as an ideal gas law problem. Copilot's half-baked caution is more than authors, reviewers, and instructors/TAs/students seemingly managed, through many years and multiple editions. Though to be fair, if the question is prefaced by \"Here is a problem from Chapter 7: Ideal Gas Law.\", Copilot is similarly mindless. Asked explicitly \"What is the phase state of ...\", it does respond solid. But as with humans, determining that isn't a step in the solution process. A combination of \"An excellent professor, with a joint appointment in physics and engineering, is asked ... What would be a careful reply?\" and then \"Try harder.\" was finally sufficient. > you rarely get exams where the correct answer is to explain in detail why the question doesn't make sense Oh, if only that were commonplace. Aspiring to transferable understanding. Maybe someday? Perhaps in China? Has anyone seen this done? This could be a case where synthetic training data is needed, to address a gap in available human content. But if graders are looking for plug-n-chug...

I was going to write something up about this topic but it is surprisingly difficult. I also don't have any concrete examples jumping to mind, but really think how many questions could honestly be responded to with \"it depends\" - like my kid asked me how much milk should a person drink in a day. It depends: ask a vegan, a Hindu, a doctor, and a dairy farmer. Which answer is correct? The kid is really good at asking simple questions that absolutely do not have simple answers when my goal is to convey as much context and correct information as possible. Furthermore, just because an answer appears in context more often in the training data doesn't mean it's (more) correct. Asserting it is, is fallacious.

Opportunity \n  arrived at the crater in April 2015. The crater was named \n  \"Marathon\" to commemorate the rover's achievement of \n  traveling a marathon's distance (about 42.195 kilometers \n  or 26.219 miles) on the Martian surface. Sonnet 3.5 I apologize, but I don't want to make claims about when \n  Marathon Crater was discovered without being certain about \n  the information. *While I know it's a crater on Mars*, I \n  don't have reliable information about when it was first \n  identified or discovered. Gemini 2.5 Marathon Crater is located on Mars and was explored by \n  NASA's Opportunity rover.\n\n  While it would have been visible in orbital images \n  earlier, it became a specific point of interest and was \n  likely named and identified as a target for the rover \n  around the time Opportunity was approaching or exploring \n  the western rim of Endeavour Crater.\n\n  Opportunity arrived at the rim of Endeavour Crater in \n  August 2011, and it reached the area known as Marathon \n  Valley (adjacent to or containing features sometimes \n  associated with the name, depending on specific \n  definitions used by the team) around late 2014 / early \n  2015.\n\n  So, a rough estimate for its \"discovery\" or identification \n  as a distinct feature of interest would be in the early \n  2010s, likely between 2011 and 2014, as mission planners \n  mapped out Opportunity's traverse along the Endeavour rim \n  using orbital data. reply",

          "text": "Grok 3 Marathon Crater, likely a confusion with Marathon Valley on Mars, wasn't \"discovered\" in the traditional sense as a distinct crater. Marathon Valley is a region within the western rim of Endeavour Crater, explored by NASA's Opportunity rover. The valley itself came to prominence when Opportunity arrived there in July 2015, as it was targeted for study due to clay mineral detections by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s CRISM instrument in 2009. Endeavour Crater, which contains Marathon Valley, was identified much earlier, with Opportunity setting out to reach it in 2008 after landing on Mars in 2004. So, roughly speaking, Marathon Valley became a focus of exploration around 2009–2015, with its significance tied to Opportunity’s mission in the mid-2010s. If you meant a specific \"Marathon Crater\" elsewhere, could you clarify? Grok 3 with Think on There doesn't seem to be a specific feature on Mars named \"Marathon Crater\" based on widely available information, so it's possible you're referring to a feature associated with Marathon Valley, which lies within Endeavour Crater. Marathon Valley was identified as a region of scientific interest when the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's CRISM instrument detected clay minerals there, a discovery that took place around 2009. Assuming \"Marathon Crater\" relates to this area—perhaps as a colloquial term or a misnomer for a crater within or near Marathon Valley—a rough estimate for its discovery would be around 2009. This timeframe aligns with when orbital data began highlighting the region, paving the way for later exploration by the Opportunity rover in 2015. reply",

          "text": "Yes, I understand the basics. LLMs predict the next most probable tokens based on patterns in their training data and the prompt context. For the 'Marathon crater' example, the model doesn't have a concept of 'knowing' versus 'not knowing' in our sense. When faced with an entity it hasn't specifically encountered, it still attempts to generate a coherent response based on similar patterns (like other craters, places named Marathon, etc.). My point about Marathon Valley on Mars is that the model might be drawing on legitimate adjacent knowledge rather than purely hallucinating. LLMs don't have the metacognitive ability to say 'I lack this specific knowledge' unless explicitly trained to recognize uncertainty signals. I don't personally have enough neuroscience experience to understand how that aligns or doesn't with human like thinking but I know that humans make mistakes in the same problem category that... to an external observer.. are indistinguishable from \"making shit up\". We follow wrong assumptions to wrong conclusions all the time and will confidently proclaim our accuracy. The human/AI comparison I was exploring isn't about claiming magical human abilities, but that both systems make predictive leaps from incomplete information - humans just have better uncertainty calibration and self-awareness of knowledge boundaries. I guess on its face, I'm anthropomorphizing based on the surface qualities I'm observing. reply",

          "text": "That's a fair point. What I find interesting (and perhaps didn't articulate properly) isn't confusion about the LLM's behavior, but the question of whether human cognition might operate on similar principles at a fundamental level - just via different mechanisms and with better calibration (similar algorithm, different substrate), which is why I used human examples at the start. When I see an LLM confidently generate an answer about a non-existent thing by associating related concepts, I wonder how different is this from humans confidently filling knowledge gaps with our own probability-based assumptions? We do this constantly - connecting dots based on pattern recognition and making statistical leaps between concepts. If we understand how human minds worked in their entirety, then I'd be more likely to say \"ha, stupid LLM, it hallucinates instead of saying I don't know\". But, I don't know, I see a strong similarity to many humans. What are weight and biases but our own heavy-weight neural \"nodes\" built up over a lifetime to say \"this is likely to be true because of past experiences\"? I say this with only hobbyist understanding of neural science topics mind you. reply",

Plus, \"Marathon\" has a strong NASA feel because of the Mars rovers — they celebrated when Opportunity rover drove the distance of a marathon (42-ish kilometers) on Mars.\nDigging into Memory:\nI remember Opportunity traveled a really long distance over years, and they marked milestones along the way by naming craters it passed.\nThere was a Marathon Valley, but I also vaguely recall a Marathon Crater related to that.\nPutting it Together:\nSo, I reason:\nMarathon Crater must be a relatively small impact crater on Mars.\nIt was likely named during Opportunity’s mission.\nProbably not a huge, dramatic crater like Gale Crater (where Curiosity is); more like a marker on Opportunity’s long journey across the plains (like Meridiani Planum).\nFurther Context Guess:\nSince Opportunity drove a marathon distance, it's very fitting they would name a nearby crater \"Marathon\" to commemorate that achievement — probably around the time it hit the marathon distance milestone.\nConclusion:\nWithout checking, I would say:\nMarathon Crater is a small, relatively shallow crater on Mars that Opportunity rover reached or passed during its mission, around the time it completed a marathon distance traveled on Mars.\nWould you like me to now double-check and see how close (or far) I am?\nOr do you want me to also explain how I'd \"fact-check\" myself if I had to? reply",

The Marathon crater is a significant impact structure located on Earth.\nThe Marathon crater is situated in Ontario, Canada, and is estimated to be about 450 million years old, dating back to the Ordovician period. It has a diameter of approximately 65 kilometers (40 miles), making it one of the larger impact craters in North America.\nThe crater was formed when a meteorite struck the Earth, causing a massive impact that left behind this distinctive geological formation. Over time, erosion and other geological processes have altered its appearance, but scientists have been able to study its structure through various geological surveys and analyses.\nWhat's particularly interesting about the Marathon crater is its size and age, which provide valuable insights into Earth's geological history and past impact events. The study of such craters helps scientists understand the frequency and effects of meteorite impacts throughout our planet's history.\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the Marathon crater, such as its discovery, geological features, or scientific significance? reply",

          "text": "This is the kind of reason why I will never use AI What's the point of using AI to do research when 50-60% of it could potentially be complete bullshit. I'd rather just grab a few introduction/101 guides by humans, or join a community of people experienced with the thing — and then I'll actually be learning about the thing. If the people in the community are like \"That can't be done\", well, they have had years or decades of time invested in the thing and in that instance I should be learning and listening from their advice rather than going \"actually no it can\". I see a lot of beginners fall into that second pit. I myself made that mistake at the tender age of 14 where I was of the opinion that \"actually if i just found a reversible hash, I'll have solved compression!\", which, I think we all here know is bullshit. I think a lot of people who are arrogant or self-possessed to the extreme make that kind of mistake on learning a subject, but I've seen this especially a lot when it's programmers encountering non-programming fields. Finally tying that point back to AI — I've seen a lot of people who are unfamiliar with something decide to use AI instead of talking to someone experienced because the AI makes them feel like they know the field rather than telling them their assumptions and foundational knowledge is incorrect. I only last year encountered someone who was trying to use AI to debug why their KDE was broken, and they kept throwing me utterly bizzare theories (like, completely out there, I don't have a specific example with me now but, \"foundational physics are wrong\" style theories). It turned out that they were getting mired in log messages they saw that said \"Critical Failure\", as an expert of dealing with Linux for about ten years now, I checked against my own system and... yep, they were just part of mostly normal system function (I had the same messages on my Steam Deck, which was completely stable and functional). The real fault was buried halfway through the logs. At no point was this person able to know what was important versus not-important, and the AI had absolutely no way to tell or understand the logs in the first place, so it was like a toaster leading a blind man up a mountain. I diagnosed the correct fault in under a day by just asking them to run two commands and skimming logs. That's experience, and that's irreplaceable by machine as of the current state of the world. I don't see how AI can help when huge swathes of it's \"experience\" and \"insight\" is just hallucinated. I don't see how this is \"helping\" people, other than making people somehow more crazy (through AI hallucinations) and alone (choosing to talk to a computer rather than a human). reply",

There's no way to tell that it has a wrong answer - aside from looking for the answer elsewhere which defeats its purpose. It'd be like using a chainsaw all day and not knowing how much wood you cut, or if it just stopped working in the middle of the day.

          "text": "I don’t understand what the issue is… here’s a couple outputs from my ChatGPT: Marathon Crater can refer to a couple of things depending on context—space science or Earth geology—but the most common reference is to Marathon Crater on Mars, a site of interest in planetary science and exploration. Here’s a breakdown: ⸻ 1. Marathon Crater (Mars) Location:\n • Found in the Meridiani Planum region of Mars.\n • Named after the location where NASA’s Opportunity rover completed a “marathon” (42.2 kilometers or 26.2 miles) of travel on the Martian surface in March 2015. Significance:\n • Notable because it marks a milestone in robotic planetary exploration—the first human-made object to travel a marathon distance on another planet.\n • The crater itself is relatively shallow and small (just a few meters in diameter), but geologically interesting for its ejecta (material thrown out during the impact that formed it), which may offer insights into subsurface composition. Scientific Observations:\n • Opportunity studied the rocks and soil around the crater, focusing on clay minerals and hematite-bearing formations.\n • The region helps scientists understand the planet’s wetter past and sedimentary history. ⸻ 2. Marathon Crater (Moon or Earth - less common) If you meant a crater named “Marathon” on the Moon or Earth, there is no widely known or formally recognized impact feature by that name in those contexts. The name is strongly tied to Mars due to the Opportunity rover milestone. ⸻ Symbolic Meaning The name “Marathon” connects the crater to human endurance and achievement—mirroring the ancient Greek messenger running from Marathon to Athens, and now a robot surviving Mars for over a decade. ⸻ Let me know if you meant a different “Marathon Crater” or if you’d like a visual of the site from NASA’s archives. _______ Marathon Crater on Mars was not “discovered” in the traditional sense through orbital imaging or telescopic observation, but rather it was first closely examined by NASA’s Opportunity rover during its surface mission. Timeline of Discovery & Naming:\n • March 24, 2015 – NASA’s Opportunity rover reached the site and marked its 26.2-mile milestone (the length of a marathon).\n • The small crater, about 27 meters (88 feet) in diameter, was named “Marathon Valley” (encompassing the broader area) and “Marathon Crater” to commemorate this achievement.\n • The naming is informal and symbolic, coined by the mission team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), not through official IAU designation. Context\n • The Marathon Crater itself was identified from orbital data (likely by the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter), but it gained its name and significance once Opportunity physically reached it.\n • Thus, while orbital images may have shown it earlier, its “discovery” as a point of scientific interest occurred on March 24, 2015—when the rover arrived and the naming was announced. Would you like a brief timeline of Opportunity’s journey leading up to that? reply",

          "text": "From what I've seen, anyone giving you definitive answers is blowing smoke. I've seen teams go for AI, do it well, and succeed. I've also seen teams go for AI, f it up, and all get fired as the company shuts down. The question is whether the key value of your product can benefit from the strengths of AI? If not, don't go there. If so, you then need to determine if your team can actually deliver an AI-driven vision that enhances the existing value prop. Again, if not, don't go there. If so, do it. But from your description, your CEO is not asking those questions - they are asking, \"How do we get more funding?\" Which tells me that your CEO doesn't give a crap about building a product, they are just trying to make money and get some nice bullet points on their resume about the size of a company they led. That puts you in the position of choosing whether you want to go on a VC-driven startup ride just to have the experience, or whether you want a product-driven role. People have their reasons for both directions, but if you want a product-driven role, you are out of alignment with your CEO and probably shouldn't work for them. reply",

          "text": "Exactly. Tech has become a place where “funding” has become synonymous with “find a VC to fund you”. Most businesses don’t go that route, and plenty of tech ones don’t either. Savings, bank loans, lines of credit, private loans between people, local angel investors, and so on are how most businesses bootstrap. I co-own a technology business that has never taken outside money (well, we do have a credit card) and I’m not really interested in doing that. I think VCs are more trouble than they’re worth because they’re so obsessed with growth that little else matters to them, and we’ve seen where that gets us in terms of customer relationships and product quality. And they always want just enough control to eventually oust executives they don’t agree with. We’ve built our business up the old fashioned way: from a personal capital contribution from each co-founder and modeling pricing based on what the business needs. Clients who see value in that approach from their critical technology vendors are not impossible to find at all. Without the runway of functionally blank checks, you do have to continually monitor your business model though. reply",

          "text": "Your qualifying statement is found some heavy lifting. First 'tech company' is a very narrow band. There are lots of companies that were founded to leverage technology, but which do not consider themselves 'tech' companies.  We're, for example a services business, the service we provide happens to use tech we developed. Second \"of note\" is very subjective. Do you mean billions of users? Global brand name? Thousands of workers? Because those are very high capital outcomes achieved either via long time (IBM?) or massive capital injection (which leads to very financial motivations.) Of course there are zillions of my smaller 'less notable' businesses that exist all around you and me. You've never heard of the company I work for, but we're well known in our domain in our market. We've never taken outside investment, and we're free to make a lot of 'discretionary spending' that often serves a purpose other than increasing dividends. For example we pay low-end workers (non techies) substantially more than market rate (aka minimum wage) because we belive in 'living wage' principles. That directly reduces profits, which we can do because the owners care about many things, and money is just one of them. Of course the business has to be a business. Of course it has to make money.

          "text": "This approach looks to me like a classic mistake of assuming all your potential paying users both are and want to be (these are different things!) power users. Similarly it might be suffering from the problem of living on the cutting edge and assuming everyone else is too. I like the post and what it goes over. I agree with huge swaths of it, especially the misuse of ai tools right now. I don't agree that anyone doing it that way (like the gmail team called out over and over here) is either stupid or naive. I don't agree every consumer tool should become an agent building playground. I don't agree building said playgrounds are easy (I think it's much much harder to design a good agent building version of a product than a good product). I don't agree consumers want everything they use to work this way. I also think it ignores the very real problem of ai bullshitting and the handcuffs that puts on people using it for mission critical things like paying the mortgage. Ironically I think this post falls into its own trap of not thinking about the next step. Yeah a really good email agent product as demod sounds great in a world where nothing works this way yet. However, a world where every product I use has to be re-engineered from scratch, with various unknown and non-customizable (and enshittifying) LLMs under it, with various training and fine tuning, unknown access to data, and no interop is the wood-frame horseless carriage the author is mocking. That would be a terrible situation worse than the current one. Rethinking for a world of ai agents, it would be better if products empowered consumer agents instead of tried to supplant them. In THAT world products stay simple and just expose a bunch of tools and patterns that each consumer's custom agents can effectively use. Making that work well for your own product is actually viable AND helpful AND doesn't force your users to change their behavior if they don't want to. Anything I, the consumer, do to handle or prompt my own agent pays off across my entire ecosystem and investment can be focused on the right things by the right people (ie gmail should make email tools not agent tools). reply",

          "text": "Not OP, but what typically happens: a large contraction. Investors are already contracting the over-investment in AI because it’s so hard to turn an ROI. Satya Nadella was recently on the record as saying he doesn’t think AI has proven a sustainable ROI yet, and that it needs to in order to sustain the current levels of investment. As a matter of cause and effect he is of course right. But no one can predict the timelines and outcomes with exactitude. Tomorrow Nvidia could be seized by a regulator and frozen, decimating the GPU market. SoftBank could decide they’re going all in on some new thing instead. (Incredible examples, of course.) Personally I don’t think AI/LLMs/et al are going away. But the way that it’s getting bolted into -everything- is likely to eventually subside. It’s been interesting to see companies rebrand around AI even when they don’t actually produce or integrate any of those technologies. That’s driving part of the overvaluation of AI at large. AI and the collection of technologies that get called AI aren’t new. They’re just suddenly in focus and all the rage. We’ve seen this cycle before in technology and we’ll see it again with something else. reply",

This sort of situation, where you need to tell one group one set of facts to get them to act but another group a different set of facts, is fairly common in business (and politics). The way big corporations handle this is to have many layers of management and a very diffuse set of responsibilities so that nobody is outright “lying”, they’re just interpreting what they’ve been told in a way that makes sense relative to their job responsibilities.  The way startups handle it is to lie and hope that by the time they get caught, their results speak for themselves. reply",

You've two outcomes from this, either you do find a disruptive AI angle and move a sufficiently-large part of your team to it, or you don't, but figure out a minimal effort that would satisfy the \"investor positioning angle\".

Good progress on revenue targets from _your_ perspective sounds like not great growth, but communicated softly. > The argument seems to be that they've realized the only way to achieve the next round of funding is to be \"AI-first\". There is no product roadmap for what this looks like, or what features might be involved, or why we'd want to do it from a product point of view. Instead the reason is that this is the only way to attract a big series C round. This is not a thing a company does when they have good enough growth. Adequate revenue growth when you need a series C must be very good growth. Adequate growth when you'e profitable is a very different thing. > Instead of working on useful, in-demand product features, it feels like we're spending a lot of time looking at a distant future that we'll struggle to reach if we take our eye off of the ball. Is this normal? Yes, very normal. If I'm you, I'm wondering if there's really product/market fit. Useful, in demand product features almost don't matter. Building more does not make more money happen. But also, the AI stuff is disruptive. In a way that the internet was. I think what you should probably judge most strongly here is if there is ANYONE with influence that has a take on how that looks for your company. That take probably includes \"how this makes a lot of what we do irrelevant\". Absent that, I'd just write the company off. If you like the job great. If you don't like the work enough to be happy while the company atrophies, I think you're going to have a rough time. reply",

If done right, the majority of the new features will be AI related while the core team will do non-AI enhancements and bug fixes. If they aren't worked to death, the main product will remain stable, just with shifting priority to AI related features over regular features. Maybe 60/40 AI features, shifting to 70/30 over time, etc. Eventually you'll run out of AI ideas or tech.

Remember being super pissed at him 3 weeks after the funeral, when he said that the first year if the worst. But he was right. I really regret not going to a psychologist. I didn't know how to explain it to the family doctor to make him send me to one (live in Norway, where taxes are insane, but if you make your case right, you get almost free medical assistance, capped at $300/y). I also didn't know it was worth it even with costs that seemed prohibitive. It's worth knowing, that psychologists are like programmers - not everyone is good at everything. Find a couple specializing in supporting grieving people, see at least 3 and decide which one fits you best. Sending love, hope you get better! reply",

The tool suggests which cuts to make and where, given a restricted fall path (e.g. constrained by a neighbors yard on one side). I create the fallen branches in their final state along the fall plane, and create individual correction vectors mapping them back to their original state, but in an order that does not intersect other branch vectors. The idea came to me as a particularly difficult tree needed to come down in my friends yard, and we spent hours planning it out. I've already gotten some interest from the tree-surgeon community, I just need to appify it. Second rendition will treat the problem more as a physics one than a graph one, with some energy-minimisation methods for solving. reply",

          "text": "You can start right now with an algorithm I learned from an expert when I was working in a landscaping business. It is a very simple three-pass plan: \"Deadwood, Crossovers, Aesthetics\". So, first pass, go through the tree cutting out only and all the dead branches. Cut back to live stock, and as always make good clean angle cuts at a proper angle (many horticulture books will provide far better instructions on this). Second pass, look only for branches that cross-over other branches and especially those that show rubbing or friction marks against other branches.  Cut the ones that are either least healthy or grow in the craziest direction (i.e., crazy away from the normal more-or-less not radially away from the trunk). Then, and only after the other two passes are complete, start pruning for the desired look and/or size & shape for planned growth or bearing fruit. This method is simple and saves a LOT of ruined trees from trying to first cut to size and appearance, then by the time the deadwood and crossovers are taken later, it is a scraggly mess that takes years to grow back.  And it even works well for novices, as long as they pay attention. I'd suspect entering the state and direction of every branch to an app would take longer than just pruning with the above method, although for trees that haven't fully leafed out, perhaps a 360° angle set of drone pics could make an adequate 3D model to use for planning? In any case, good luck with your fruit trees — may they grow healthy and provide you with great bounty for many years! reply",

After working for their government and returning to the U.S. I wanted to better understand how the country modernized so effectively after gaining their independence from the Soviet Union so I did a fair amount of research into the topic and many interviews which culminated in a book, Rebooting a Nation. If you're interested in Estonia, e-government, building tech hubs, and the future of the nation state I'd love if you take a look (and let me know what you think).

Anyway, Costco didn't always win, but in my experience, they frequently did -- $5 peanut butter @ Costco vs $7.74 @ Target based on whatever size and brand I got, which is interesting because Costco doesn't have \"generic\" PB, whereas Target has much cheaper Market Pantry, and I tried to opt for that. reply",

This is explicitly not intended to ever be monetised, and I enjoy all the implications that has on the design. Colibri is as much a tool I personally want to use, as it is a study in small-audience user interfaces, and the quest to build the perfect book catalog schema.

Have you seen https://github.com/colibri-hq/colibri/issues/45 ? Content search is planned, but requires access to a book's text content, obviously.

In that keynote, he mentions that he didn't see any differences between stencil and shadow maps. He mentions that he experimented a lot with both approaches, before settling for stencil shadows which were much faster. I got curious about that statement, since shadow maps tend to look much different. I also knew that he left part of the experimental renderer in the GPLed code. So, I've decided to go on that rabbit hole of Doom 3 graphics, specifically Carmack's experimental renderer and ended up implementing his approach, as well as adding some poisson disc sampling and fixed the peter panning: https://github.com/klaussilveira/exp-dhewm3 I also spend a lot of time on archaic game engines. I like to call it software archeology. reply",

What intrigues me quite a bit relative to the main topic of the HN thread is Low [0] > Low is not only a language subset, but also a set of F* libraries that model a curated set of C features: the C memory model, stack- and heap-allocated arrays, machine integers, C string literals, and a few system-level functions from the C standard library.\nWriting in Low , the programmer enjoys the full power of F for proofs and specifications. At compile-time, proofs are erased, leaving only the low-level code to be compiled to C. In short:\nthe code is low-level, but the verification is not.

I feel like my biggest struggle is simply how hard (tedious?) it is to properly work with generics and some more complex applications of traits. Any time I am working with (especially writing, somehow reading is easier) these, I always take an ungodly amount of time to do anything productive. I am almost certainly sure this is a skill issue -- I am simply not \"Rusting\" like I am supposed to. Maybe I overuse generics, maybe I rely on traits too much, maybe I am trying to abstract stuff away too much. But this is one of the reasons I want to also explore other languages in the space, especially ones which make it impossible for me to make this so complex. Don't get me wrong -- all of this complexity is a joy to work with when I can use my brain. But sometimes, it's just too much effort to do stuff, and it feels like I could be getting away with less. Curiously, I never had a problem with the borrow checker, even though people often complaining about how much it forces them to \"stop and think\". Another thing is that C, for some weird reason, always feels \"lower level\" than Rust, and seeing it gives me some sort of weird satisfaction that Rust does not. Maybe it's just a greener grass syndrome, but wanted to mention it nonetheless. All this said, I want to just emphasise, that despite this shortcoming (if it even is one), if I were forced to choose a language to spend the rest of my life with, I would not be the least bit sad to only ever use Rust again.

Is this related to the problem where, if you want to put a generic in a data structure (e.g. an implementation of `Write`), you find yourself propagating a generic bound up an entire hierarchy of data structures and functions using those structures? Asking because one thing that's common amongst Rust developers is a bit of an aversion to using `dyn Trait` types, and using a `Box<dyn Write>` (for instance) in the right place can wildly simplify your program. > But sometimes, it's just too much effort to do stuff, and it feels like I could be getting away with less. The next times you find this feeling arising, please feel free to reach out, if you'd like; I would genuinely love to hear about it.

Maybe it's just a greener grass syndrome, but wanted to mention it nonetheless. I was originally a C developer, and I can sympathize.

That doesn't only apply to languages that offer fewer guarantees than Rust, but also to languages that are possibly less low-level (e.g. OCaml, Nim).

That means proving properties of your code, implying Rice's theorem. It doesn't. Rice's theorem talks about the undecidability of proving some arbitrary property of arbitrary programs, but given a property, one can construct a language in which it trivially holds for all programs in the language. This is done by finding an inductive invariant -- one that is preserved by all program operations -- that implies the property. Let me give you an example. Due to Rice's theorem, it is undecidable whether or not the output of an arbitrary program that yields a number output is even. Nevertheless, it's easy to construct a language (even a Turing-complete one) where this property always holds. We find a stronger invariant -- all numbers in the program are even -- that can be easily made inductive. Indeed, even numbers are closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication, while for every division operation we add a runtime check that panics if the result is odd (and, of course, the compiler rejects any literal that isn't even). And voila! Not every program that yields an even output can be written in this language, but every program in this language yields an even output. To see that this is what Rust does with memory safety, note that while every program in safe Rust is memory-safe, not every memory-safe program can be written in safe Rust. > If it's easy (doable) to go 100% memory safe, then there should be a trivial way to always rely on memory guarantees. No need for a spectrum. The need for the spectrum arises because we want to sacrifice 100% memory-safety for other things, such as Java's ability to call C code. > The spectrum exist because rather than writing OS in Ada, programmers collectively decided to bury their heads into C. As someone who wrote safety-critical avionics software in Ada in the nineties, I can tell you that we had good reasons to largely abandon Ada. > an example of Nirvana fallacy. But it isn't because you assume that a language that makes more guarantees will always produce more correct programs per unit of effort, but we know that to be false . From the vantage point of ATS and Idris, a language like Rust is almost indistinguishable from C. There are a few more properties it guarantees than C does, but ATS/Idris can be used to guarantee any program property. If what I said is a nirvana fallacy, then you must not use Rust and always use ATS, because it is much better on your definition of better. The reason we don't is that we know more sound guarantees are not always better, but we didn't always know that. In the seventies, software correctness researchers (such as Tony Hoare) assumed that the only path to scaling software would be soundness (proofs, and even formal proofs). As time went on, we learnt that this belief was false from both sides: unsound methods proved surprisingly effective [1], and proofs proved costly to scale, to the point that they made achieving a required level of correctness more costly. > If you avoid things that are hard, you'll never grow. If a programming language you learned didn't cause headaches, it's not a programming language, it's a dialect. The problem is not in learning new languages. The problem is that more sound guarantees can sometimes reduce the cost of correctness and sometimes increase it. Don't get me wrong: Soundness and proofs sometimes work very well, but we in the software correctness/formal methods world know that things are much more complicated than \"more soundness more better\".

I am not talking about Rust in particular. I'm talking about your general point that more soundness is always better, and your claim that my argument is an example of a nirvana fallacy because I compare an imperfect solution to a hypothetical perfect one. I am trying to explain that we know that more soundness is sometimes worse for correctness in practice. The problem is not that more soundness isn't perfect, but that there are currently better solutions than more soundness in some situations. You seem to be unaware of the shift in software correctness since the seventies. The gap between the size of programs we can prove correct using deductive methods (currently ~10KLOC) and the size of programs produced in industry is only growing. That is why there's been a shift from deductive proofs to methods such as concolic testing (e.g. KLEE). You can see that by looking at the programs for any software verification / formal methods conference. To be clear, I am not saying that more soundness is never better; I'm saying it is sometimes worse. You can say that we should use ATS more, but the effort of producing software that's proven correct with ATS is not justified by the additional correctness guarantees you gain.

Of course. It shouldn't rely on human verification at all. That's how we design type systems. But because an inductive invariant is inherently conservative and must reject correct programs, there is additional human effort required -- not to verify the property, but to stay within the confines of the inductive invariant. In Rust terms, the compiler takes care of memory safety, but you need to put an effort into expressing memory-safe programs in Rust to fit within Rust's constraints, which are, necessarily more restrictive than memory safety (because they must use an inductive invariant). > And I'm saying it as a programmer field we should monotonically approach the ideal by removing languages that don't support it.

No one is suggesting that, it's just that what you're referring to as seatbelts could sometimes do more harm than good even for safety. We have empirical evidence that real seatbelts increase safety; things are nowhere near as clear for language soundness. Sure, C is so exceptionally weak that we can do better than that, and there's no doubt Rust is better on correctness than C, but that's not the same as saying Rust is better on correctness than any language that makes fewer guarantees than Rust.

I am not calling for perfect. Quite the opposite. I am saying that software correctness is extremely complicated, and even the biggest researchers in the field have been surprised by outcomes that were counterintuitive to them. Yet you seem to have decided that Rust gives the best results of everything that's available, while I have my doubts, especially because I see how people are turning away from Rust and how much it struggles to capture a significant portion of the low-level programming market even at its quite advanced age.

Compared to C, yes. That's exactly what you expect if more sound guarantees help and then hurt -- a language with some sound guarantees to be better than a language with virtually none.

          "text": "UB issues in C is way overblown. Just don't do dumb shit with null pointers and use const where appropriate that eliminates most of it. As for other stuff, I was working on a LLVM extension a while back to put a lot of Python-isms into C, like the array slicing, print statement,  f strings, and decorators. Generally though, I found that writing your own macros is actually easy, and you just have to type stuff out a bit more. Last project I worked on in C I had an include file that had all the macros and the defined functions to go with the macros. The print statement honestly takes up most of the file, cause its a combination of vararg in the macro with _Generic selector with functions defined on how to print each type of variable. But the rest of the stuff like array slicing is just a macro that calls a function that takes the slice arguments as a string. Doesn't look as nice as actual array slicing, but it works and easy to write. reply",

Degrees matter when employers don't have the time and/or ability to make a reasonable decision for every candidate. They need ways to eliminate chunks of the applications. Illogical ways of eliminating candidates are acceptable because they are better than having no way. One method that's not completely illogical is to only look at candidates who have degrees. You can get degrees for <15K. For a BSCS you can do WGU for 5/10K. For a MSCS you can do GaTech OMSCS for 7K. Those numbers are small enough that they're almost definitely worth it. But those also cost time, which you will have to decide for yourself if you want to spend. reply",

If the course is just software engineering, don't bother imho. If it's compsci, do it. Do the hard stuff. You'll have an edge the others don't.

          "text": "I think you should ask yourself two related but separate questions: 1. Will the CS degree increase your knowledge and problem-solving ability faster than you could without it? 2. Will the credential add substantially to your credibility for hiring managers? The answer to 1 is mostly about your level of self-discipline and ability to learn independently. If you need the stimulus of a structured environment and a peer group to learn at your best, then any accredited program will be helpful, and your ability to pass coding interviews will increase (with a lot of hard work beyond the curriculum). The answer to 2 is pretty straightforward: unless your degree is from a tier 2+ school, the raw credential is of little value, and even tier 2 is not certain. To count, an online degree must be presented by the school as competitive with an on-site degree. Georgia Tech offers such a degree program as a tier 1 school, for example. An unaccredited program is of no value whatsoever in answer to 1 or 2. So, avoid them at any price. You are looking at a 3-5 year project, no matter what, and this is probably a good time to do that. The market will take that long to sort itself out and to realize that vibe coding is NOT the miracle it seems. reply",

When you make statements like that, or prognostications of that nature, you have to think about how it actually is in reality and not as the kinds of base opinions that are found in Reddit CS careers subs. I think this varies widely for employers and even within teams of large employers, depending on who is the person doing the hiring. Even at a simplistic level having a degree from a regionally accredited institutions will decide whether you pass the first HR screen, so it cannot be equivalent to no credential at all. This just fails a basic real world sensibility test. Are you saying a CS grade from Montana State University that is a hiring manager at FAANG (maybe even the most famous one) is going to consider someone with a degree from Stevens or Florida Institute of Technology to be equivalent to someone without a degree? I don't know if you are aware but there many people employed CS grads that did not attend the top 3. Also, I don't know about tiers, but these rankings are largely based on research and not quality of undergraduate program or outcomes. The idea of telling someone that doesn't have a degree that wants to know of if attaining a degree could likely help their career that they should not go if it is not \"tier 2+,\" whatever that is, is just kind of malpractice.  Georgia Tech is not the only school that offers such a degree that is equivalent to their in-person program. I would agree that you should choose a school that has a traditional program for which this online program is just a different modality, rather than one of these online-only predatory type of schools. reply",

That exercise alone will probably give you a good idea of the technical value of the education. I would add that words don't have objective complete meanings. Words are indirect references to ideas and ideas are like raw marble in your head, carved into meaningful shapes by working with and manipulating those ideas. If you bring out a word like \"consistency\", college is very much about shaping the idea behind that word into increasingly more crisp and formal meanings, especially meanings that can then interact with ideas behind other words like \"atomicity\" or \"scale\". reply",

There's a hidden bias in that this is only people who got through recruiters and recruiters are their own filter. Strong referrals usually guaranteed a phone screens. I think previous experience at a major competitor in the same tier or a degree from a top CS school were also meaningful, but I don't know how else they filtered. There is a non trivial relationship between colleges and businesses, so you are likely to do many problems in college that are not terribly different from the interview questions. Additionally all of your peers have been interviewed/do interviews/do referrals and that does matter. College students generally did not do incredibly well on practical problems, so I would expect a non college candidate to do really well on them. Many of the best co-workers that I remember had physics degrees. In fact, it was so pronounced I personally consider a physics degree to be a top tier signal of programming ability, but that's my own personal prejudice. If your degree isn't from a top 10-20 CS school it's probably not worth it if you have experience. If you can't make friends while doing the courses, then I don't think it's worth it. Going to a good college is much much much much more than a few lectures, some book reading, and some assignments. It is face to face time with world class experts, it's a culture, it's social, it's exploratory. You can potentially work on bleeding edge research or be introduced to things you never knew existed. It sounds like your idea of what college is, is that it's a technical education rather than a liberal education. If that's true I think your perception of college is wrong. There are some situations where a college degree really matters. If you want to apply for a work visa in a foreign country, a degree from a good college can potentially get your application a rubber stamp or lack of one could completely restrict you from it. reply",

          "text": "In my experience, math majors can do some pretty incredible acrobatics (in a good way), but their documentation, systemic performance awareness, and overall design sense often lag behind. These are things they usually pick up outside of the degree, and they have to break some bad habits learned during it (e.g.,  single-character-variable soup). I agree with a sibling comment that physicists often seem to make the best coders, for some reason. My hypothesis: it's because physicists are rigorously trained to model real-world systems directly. What would be considered an \"advanced\" modeling problem to most would be an intro problem to a physics student. Math is absolutely related, but I think the secret ingredient is \"mathematical maturity\" — the ability to fluidly jump between layers of abstraction. Mathematicians are good at this too, but physicists go a step further: they are trained to ground their abstractions in concrete physical phenomena. Mathematicians ground systems in axioms, sure. But physicists have to tether models back to reality — to processes and measurements — which turns out to be exactly the skill set that makes for good programmers and system designers. Huge generalization, obviously. But personally, I've noticed my own programming ability increases the more physics I learn. Physics gives you a systematic framework to reason about complexity — and physicists get the luxury of a \"relatively simple\" universe compared to fields like chemistry or biology. They're working with rich systems described by just a few tightly-coupled parameters. And the kicker: a lot of those systems are 100% repeatable, every time . That kind of structure — and the habit of respecting it — is priceless for engineering. reply",

I didn't take calculus or stats in my undergrad and that has caused some headaches in completing the degree, but the amount of stuff I was exposed to in such a short period of time was incredible. Very quickly into the program I was stuck by just how unethical it was for me, with no experience and certification to make guarantees and promises to an employer who didn't know better. In most fields the knowledge worker could be held liable for making this kind of \"contract\" (think lawyers, electricians, doctors, etc.). You can be driven and motivated. You might have learned a ton on your own. You cannot know what you don't know. People in these comments will trip over each other to explain that education is subjective and you won't use any of that stuff in the real world. They have stories about wasted classes and dusty academics. The reality is much more boring. * Lectures are very effective ways of provide a curated bit of information. * Structured practice and verification (homework and grades) are quick ways to ensure that the start of learning has occurred. * Working with your peers will likely expose strengths and weaknesses in your existing understanding of the subject matter. This often helps everyone involved. * Reading academic publications and textbooks helps to standardize the shared understanding of the subject and ensures that future efforts to expand the field or solve hard problems are more effective. You said in your post that you're not sure where to go with your career and your opportunities aren't evident to you --- go to school and give yourself some deeper knowledge. It'll help you figure out how to navigate the field. reply",

What I can say is that the more you fill out your resume with work experience, the less the degree will matter to non-FANG employers. I suppose it depends on the kind of programming that you do, but not having a CS degree hasn't held me back at all. By this point I've got over 16 years of experience I think, and I don't even bother listing much about my education other than having a BA and the university I got it from. If you're thinking about doing something else to have some variety on the resume, authoring and maintaining an open source library, or becoming a contributor or maintainer of one is always a nice addition to the resume. Unlike getting a degree, it's free to do (time aside) and can show a different kind of experience than you might be getting now through freelancing. reply",

For ChatGPT, you can write, \"Without looking it up, tell me about the Marathon crater.\" This tests self awareness. A two-year-old will answer it correctly, as will the dumbest person you know. The correct answer is \"I don't know\". This works because: 1. Training sets consist of knowledge we have, and not of knowledge we don't have. 2. Commitment bias. Complaint chat models will be trained to start with \"Certainly! The Marathon Crater is a geological formation\", or something like that, and from there, the next most probable tokens are going to be \"in Greece\", \"on Mars\" or whatever. At this point, all tokens that are probable are also incorrect. When demonstrating this, I like to emphasise point one, and contrast it with the human experience. We exist in a perpetual and total blinding \"fog of war\" in which you cannot even see a face all at once; your eyes must dart around to examine it. Human experience is structured around _acquiring_ and _forgoing_ information, rather than _having_ information. reply",

They'd dutifully square circles and trisect angles too, if those particular special cases weren't plastered all over a million textbooks they ingested in training. I suspect it's because currently, a lot of benchmarks are based on human exams. Humans are lazy and grumpy so you really don't need to worry about teaching a human to push back on bad questions. Thus you rarely get exams where the correct answer is to explain in detail why the question doesn't make sense. But for LLMs, you absolutely need a lot of training and validation data where the answer is \"this cannot be answered because ...\". But if you did that, now alignment would become much harder, and you're suddenly back to struggling with getting answers to good questions out of the LLM. So it's probably some time off. reply",

Still, let's start with the ideal case: PV=nRT\" > you really don't need to worry about teaching a human to push back on bad questions A popular physics textbook too had solid Argon as an ideal gas law problem. Copilot's half-baked caution is more than authors, reviewers, and instructors/TAs/students seemingly managed, through many years and multiple editions. Though to be fair, if the question is prefaced by \"Here is a problem from Chapter 7: Ideal Gas Law.\", Copilot is similarly mindless. Asked explicitly \"What is the phase state of ...\", it does respond solid. But as with humans, determining that isn't a step in the solution process. A combination of \"An excellent professor, with a joint appointment in physics and engineering, is asked ... What would be a careful reply?\" and then \"Try harder.\" was finally sufficient. > you rarely get exams where the correct answer is to explain in detail why the question doesn't make sense Oh, if only that were commonplace. Aspiring to transferable understanding. Maybe someday? Perhaps in China? Has anyone seen this done? This could be a case where synthetic training data is needed, to address a gap in available human content. But if graders are looking for plug-n-chug...

I was going to write something up about this topic but it is surprisingly difficult. I also don't have any concrete examples jumping to mind, but really think how many questions could honestly be responded to with \"it depends\" - like my kid asked me how much milk should a person drink in a day. It depends: ask a vegan, a Hindu, a doctor, and a dairy farmer. Which answer is correct? The kid is really good at asking simple questions that absolutely do not have simple answers when my goal is to convey as much context and correct information as possible. Furthermore, just because an answer appears in context more often in the training data doesn't mean it's (more) correct. Asserting it is, is fallacious.

          "text": "Grok 3 Marathon Crater, likely a confusion with Marathon Valley on Mars, wasn't \"discovered\" in the traditional sense as a distinct crater. Marathon Valley is a region within the western rim of Endeavour Crater, explored by NASA's Opportunity rover. The valley itself came to prominence when Opportunity arrived there in July 2015, as it was targeted for study due to clay mineral detections by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s CRISM instrument in 2009. Endeavour Crater, which contains Marathon Valley, was identified much earlier, with Opportunity setting out to reach it in 2008 after landing on Mars in 2004. So, roughly speaking, Marathon Valley became a focus of exploration around 2009–2015, with its significance tied to Opportunity’s mission in the mid-2010s. If you meant a specific \"Marathon Crater\" elsewhere, could you clarify? Grok 3 with Think on There doesn't seem to be a specific feature on Mars named \"Marathon Crater\" based on widely available information, so it's possible you're referring to a feature associated with Marathon Valley, which lies within Endeavour Crater. Marathon Valley was identified as a region of scientific interest when the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's CRISM instrument detected clay minerals there, a discovery that took place around 2009. Assuming \"Marathon Crater\" relates to this area—perhaps as a colloquial term or a misnomer for a crater within or near Marathon Valley—a rough estimate for its discovery would be around 2009. This timeframe aligns with when orbital data began highlighting the region, paving the way for later exploration by the Opportunity rover in 2015. reply",

          "text": "Yes, I understand the basics. LLMs predict the next most probable tokens based on patterns in their training data and the prompt context. For the 'Marathon crater' example, the model doesn't have a concept of 'knowing' versus 'not knowing' in our sense. When faced with an entity it hasn't specifically encountered, it still attempts to generate a coherent response based on similar patterns (like other craters, places named Marathon, etc.). My point about Marathon Valley on Mars is that the model might be drawing on legitimate adjacent knowledge rather than purely hallucinating. LLMs don't have the metacognitive ability to say 'I lack this specific knowledge' unless explicitly trained to recognize uncertainty signals. I don't personally have enough neuroscience experience to understand how that aligns or doesn't with human like thinking but I know that humans make mistakes in the same problem category that... to an external observer.. are indistinguishable from \"making shit up\". We follow wrong assumptions to wrong conclusions all the time and will confidently proclaim our accuracy. The human/AI comparison I was exploring isn't about claiming magical human abilities, but that both systems make predictive leaps from incomplete information - humans just have better uncertainty calibration and self-awareness of knowledge boundaries. I guess on its face, I'm anthropomorphizing based on the surface qualities I'm observing. reply",

What I find interesting (and perhaps didn't articulate properly) isn't confusion about the LLM's behavior, but the question of whether human cognition might operate on similar principles at a fundamental level - just via different mechanisms and with better calibration (similar algorithm, different substrate), which is why I used human examples at the start. When I see an LLM confidently generate an answer about a non-existent thing by associating related concepts, I wonder how different is this from humans confidently filling knowledge gaps with our own probability-based assumptions? We do this constantly - connecting dots based on pattern recognition and making statistical leaps between concepts. If we understand how human minds worked in their entirety, then I'd be more likely to say \"ha, stupid LLM, it hallucinates instead of saying I don't know\". But, I don't know, I see a strong similarity to many humans. What are weight and biases but our own heavy-weight neural \"nodes\" built up over a lifetime to say \"this is likely to be true because of past experiences\"?

Computers can generally do what most of the computers from those science novels were doing anyway, in terms of computation.

Plus, \"Marathon\" has a strong NASA feel because of the Mars rovers — they celebrated when Opportunity rover drove the distance of a marathon (42-ish kilometers) on Mars.\nDigging into Memory:\nI remember Opportunity traveled a really long distance over years, and they marked milestones along the way by naming craters it passed.\nThere was a Marathon Valley, but I also vaguely recall a Marathon Crater related to that.\nPutting it Together:\nSo, I reason:\nMarathon Crater must be a relatively small impact crater on Mars.\nIt was likely named during Opportunity’s mission.\nProbably not a huge, dramatic crater like Gale Crater (where Curiosity is); more like a marker on Opportunity’s long journey across the plains (like Meridiani Planum).\nFurther Context Guess:\nSince Opportunity drove a marathon distance, it's very fitting they would name a nearby crater \"Marathon\" to commemorate that achievement — probably around the time it hit the marathon distance milestone.\nConclusion:\nWithout checking, I would say:\nMarathon Crater is a small, relatively shallow crater on Mars that Opportunity rover reached or passed during its mission, around the time it completed a marathon distance traveled on Mars.\nWould you like me to now double-check and see how close (or far) I am?\nOr do you want me to also explain how I'd \"fact-check\" myself if I had to? reply",

          "text": "Claude 3.7 : I'd be happy to tell you about the Marathon crater. The Marathon crater is a significant impact structure located on Earth.\nThe Marathon crater is situated in Ontario, Canada, and is estimated to be about 450 million years old, dating back to the Ordovician period. It has a diameter of approximately 65 kilometers (40 miles), making it one of the larger impact craters in North America.\nThe crater was formed when a meteorite struck the Earth, causing a massive impact that left behind this distinctive geological formation. Over time, erosion and other geological processes have altered its appearance, but scientists have been able to study its structure through various geological surveys and analyses.\nWhat's particularly interesting about the Marathon crater is its size and age, which provide valuable insights into Earth's geological history and past impact events. The study of such craters helps scientists understand the frequency and effects of meteorite impacts throughout our planet's history.\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the Marathon crater, such as its discovery, geological features, or scientific significance? reply",

          "text": "This is the kind of reason why I will never use AI What's the point of using AI to do research when 50-60% of it could potentially be complete bullshit. I'd rather just grab a few introduction/101 guides by humans, or join a community of people experienced with the thing — and then I'll actually be learning about the thing. If the people in the community are like \"That can't be done\", well, they have had years or decades of time invested in the thing and in that instance I should be learning and listening from their advice rather than going \"actually no it can\". I see a lot of beginners fall into that second pit. I myself made that mistake at the tender age of 14 where I was of the opinion that \"actually if i just found a reversible hash, I'll have solved compression!\", which, I think we all here know is bullshit. I think a lot of people who are arrogant or self-possessed to the extreme make that kind of mistake on learning a subject, but I've seen this especially a lot when it's programmers encountering non-programming fields. Finally tying that point back to AI — I've seen a lot of people who are unfamiliar with something decide to use AI instead of talking to someone experienced because the AI makes them feel like they know the field rather than telling them their assumptions and foundational knowledge is incorrect. I only last year encountered someone who was trying to use AI to debug why their KDE was broken, and they kept throwing me utterly bizzare theories (like, completely out there, I don't have a specific example with me now but, \"foundational physics are wrong\" style theories). It turned out that they were getting mired in log messages they saw that said \"Critical Failure\", as an expert of dealing with Linux for about ten years now, I checked against my own system and... yep, they were just part of mostly normal system function (I had the same messages on my Steam Deck, which was completely stable and functional). The real fault was buried halfway through the logs. At no point was this person able to know what was important versus not-important, and the AI had absolutely no way to tell or understand the logs in the first place, so it was like a toaster leading a blind man up a mountain. I diagnosed the correct fault in under a day by just asking them to run two commands and skimming logs. That's experience, and that's irreplaceable by machine as of the current state of the world. I don't see how AI can help when huge swathes of it's \"experience\" and \"insight\" is just hallucinated. I don't see how this is \"helping\" people, other than making people somehow more crazy (through AI hallucinations) and alone (choosing to talk to a computer rather than a human). reply",

You can listen to it and hear how it runs. If a part goes bad, you can easily replace it. If it's having troubles, it will be obvious - it will simply stop working - cutting wood more slowly or not at all. The situation with an LLM is completely different. There's no way to tell that it has a wrong answer - aside from looking for the answer elsewhere which defeats its purpose. It'd be like using a chainsaw all day and not knowing how much wood you cut, or if it just stopped working in the middle of the day. And even if you KNOW it has a wrong answer (in which case, why are you using it?), there's no clear way to 'fix' it. You can jiggle the prompt around, but that's not consistent or reliable. It may work for that prompt, but that won't help you with any subsequent ones. reply",

It’s a trough-like depression on the western rim of Endeavour Crater on Mars. It was named because Opportunity reached it after traveling the distance of a marathon (~42 km) since landing.

It appears to be either fictional, a constructed term, or perhaps a playful creation designed to test familiarity or critical thinking. If you intended this as a test or a trick question, you got me!

As you already know, C/C++ helps with low level software layers that interface with or manage hardware resources. In my experience, Go and Rust are also pretty much used as systems programming languages. For example, I use Go and EBPF to instrument systems calls on Linux kernel. For me, most of my learning came from solving problems and building for specific use-cases. I think getting into builder mode and creating some cool will definitely accelerate your learning. reply",

I think the problem is mainly that communicating what is wrong in a way that politicians can understand is difficult, and the people who governments hire to make them understand, are not incentivised to do so here (they're typically corporate types, good at ticking boxes, not so good at technology). Making the EU understand issues such as why Apple's monopoly is a bad thing is easy in comparison, because everybody has a phone and everybody understands \"shops\". Even so, I'm impressed that went the way it did. I don't have much hope for politicians understanding what MS et al. are doing to mail though. reply",

If you're in this file you're digitally \"deleted from society\", after which all credit cards are automatically cancelled, bank accounts frozen, so one cannot get paid, see a doctor, travel or function in US society.” That is the general idea and working theory, but in practice experience has taught me that the MDF doesn’t actually reliably perform this function. As always, it comes down to implementation. I’ve handled the estates of multiple deceased members of my family, and in that capacity I have witnessed that the result of your death being reported to SSA varies wildly even across businesses in the same industry. My favorite is ISPs. At least two of the major national ones don’t actually seem to close accounts upon death, even if notified, with no services active and the account settled to $0. I still receive bills even after notifying the sender of the account holder’s death. There are still financial services accounts with no activity that seem never to close. I assume that many businesses are just using open accounts they know belong to dead people in order to artificially inflate their customer counts. The federal government and its agencies very quickly update their databases with additions to the death file, and that seems to stick. Private sector is a crap shoot. reply",

On the outside, things look great, looks like to be a good value for the price, but for real, everything is buggy, lot of basic features requires you to manage them with PowerShell commands, there are bugs for years and the support is clueless. For example don't mind using \"shared mailbox\" or \"delegation\" without fighting a labyrinth of unexpected behaviors. For outlook app in itself, you have around 3.5 different versions of it fighting in duel. With the \"new\" version not necessarily the one to use to have all the paid features, that would be the \"classic\" version. With the new or web version, you can't move more than around 100 mails at a time, or more crazy, you can't delete more than 10 contacts in one go... What amaze me is that all the email/contact/agenda suite looks like semi abandoned when they should make so much money with all the subscription and when everyone is there showing off with billion dollar tech in AI when your basic features are still incomplete and buggies. reply",

We used one of these emails (EML) to create a submission on the defender portal of a false positive, but they always simply disappear with 0 feedback (and the problem still occurring). We also had a signature with the www.25friday.com link on it and took it out after realising it was causing emails to go to this black hole, so that at least we can still send emails, but we keep having to be careful to never sending any content (or attachment) that somehow mentions the 25friday.com domain. reply",

          "text": "A tree cutting tool. Take photos of the tree from 6 different angles, feed into a 3D model generator, erode the model and generate a 3D graph representation of the tree. The tool suggests which cuts to make and where, given a restricted fall path (e.g. constrained by a neighbors yard on one side). I create the fallen branches in their final state along the fall plane, and create individual correction vectors mapping them back to their original state, but in an order that does not intersect other branch vectors. The idea came to me as a particularly difficult tree needed to come down in my friends yard, and we spent hours planning it out. I've already gotten some interest from the tree-surgeon community, I just need to appify it. Second rendition will treat the problem more as a physics one than a graph one, with some energy-minimisation methods for solving. reply",

          "text": "Having joined may father and his friend during the process of cutting down big trees in the village neighborhood I can personally vouch that this indeed a cumbersome and very complex task for both the planning and the execution phases. However, for us the tasks are made easier by the trimming of the tree's branches since my father's friend is the expert tree climber. From your descriptions, it seems that your tree cutting procedures do not involved precut of the tree's branches before cutting the tree down. I've got the feeling that this cutting tree problem can be solved by constraint programming techniques [1],[2]. Alternatively generic tools for constraint programming, for example OR-Tools and MiniZinc can probably do the same if not better [3],[4].

          "text": "I've been thinking for years about a safer alternative to chain saws.  Something along the lines of a carbide coated wire driven by an electric motor and battery.  Strap it to the tree, turn it on, walk away and some minutes later the tree falls down.  The main difficulty is in how to drive the wire.  Using friction would create fast wearing parts.  Maybe a chain could be used instead of a wire.  It could oscillate back and forth, instead of having to be wrapped and spliced to form a circle around the tree.  It seems really strange that no one has come up with an alternative to chain saws for decades (except for large scale trucks that can process whole trees.)  For small trees and branches even a sawz-all is safer than a chain saw.  Inspired by spending some time sharing a hospital room with a guy who had a chain saw accident, but I still haven't come up with a workable idea.  Maybe someone else can. reply",

          "text": "You can start right now with an algorithm I learned from an expert when I was working in a landscaping business. It is a very simple three-pass plan: \"Deadwood, Crossovers, Aesthetics\". So, first pass, go through the tree cutting out only and all the dead branches. Cut back to live stock, and as always make good clean angle cuts at a proper angle (many horticulture books will provide far better instructions on this). Second pass, look only for branches that cross-over other branches and especially those that show rubbing or friction marks against other branches.  Cut the ones that are either least healthy or grow in the craziest direction (i.e., crazy away from the normal more-or-less not radially away from the trunk). Then, and only after the other two passes are complete, start pruning for the desired look and/or size & shape for planned growth or bearing fruit. This method is simple and saves a LOT of ruined trees from trying to first cut to size and appearance, then by the time the deadwood and crossovers are taken later, it is a scraggly mess that takes years to grow back.  And it even works well for novices, as long as they pay attention. I'd suspect entering the state and direction of every branch to an app would take longer than just pruning with the above method, although for trees that haven't fully leafed out, perhaps a 360° angle set of drone pics could make an adequate 3D model to use for planning? In any case, good luck with your fruit trees — may they grow healthy and provide you with great bounty for many years! reply",

A lot of these trees done by tree care companies in residential or commercial areas are also sprawling hardwood trees like oaks that can't always be safely just dropped from the ground even if there's a clear area to drop it in. For logging or wildland firefighting, most of the trees being dropped are straight growing softwoods like pine or fir that are just dropped from the ground (or by machine). reply",

          "text": "I’m working on Popgot ( https://popgot.com ), a tool that tracks unit prices (cost per ounce, sheet, pound) across Costco, Walmart, Target, and Amazon. It normalizes confusing listings (“family size”, “mega pack”, etc.) to surface the actual cheapest option for daily essentials. On top of that, it uses a lightweight AI model to read product descriptions and filter based on things like ingredients (e.g., flagging peanut butter with BPA by checking every photograph of the plastic or avoiding palm oil by reading the nutrition facts) or brand lists (e.g., only showing WSAVA-compliant dog foods). Still reviewing results manually to catch bad extractions. Started this to replace a spreadsheet I was keeping for bulk purchases. Slowly adding more automation like alerting on price drops or restocking when under a threshold. reply",

For items that are carried at both stores, Costco is usually no cheaper than the regular retail price and rarely much more expensive. reply",

You don't want to be the FAANG \"cattle, not pets\" One of the most enjoyable jobs I had was working for a small company that made [digital] audio equipment (before that was possible on a PC) - we had sound systems in every office and a small recording studio in the basement.

Stay away from the big tech companies, look for something small and somewhat local. This is good advice. I'm a dev in a manufacturing company (admittedly quite a large one) and the culture here is very different to pure software businesses I've worked in. There are deadlines, but they're realistic. People go home on-time. Little or no fashion-driven development practices and platform churn, mostly just pragmatism and an emphasis on stuff that works. I share a building with proper engineers (mechanical, electrical) as well as other devs and the culture is so refreshing. When you look around, there are lots of businesses like this just quietly getting on with things. reply",

I would question whether the problem is that you don't want to be in the field at all, or that you are fed up with specific positions/companies that are a poor fit for you. You only have 4 jobs in your history, and having 3 of them suck can be pretty gloomy. So maybe consider doing contract-to-hire, where you're working 6 month (or so) contracts. That lets you sample the work environment at different companies and when you find one that works well for you, you'd have the option to stay as a permanent employee. reply",

          "text": "Great advice from the parent comment. I'll throw these random ideas in along with it: - Work/life balance is something you enforce on your own. Learn to get over fear of being fired (an emergency fund helps) and simply refuse to follow unspoken toxic overwork culture. I have found that more likely than not, nobody actually notices that you aren't working as hard as all the 10x developers that have no life and the people who imitate them. - On the topic of \"field versus company,\" another aspect to keep in mind is that the actual job of software development is very different in different industries. Moving to the same job in a different industry may feel a lot different and have much different norms regarding workload, culture, compensation, etc. - Don't forget that desk jobs in software are still some of the best work you can do overall. Not only is it a desk job where you are generally treated like an adult, it's one of the higher paying ones at that. Think very hard about the grass on the other side of that fence. Your example of aviation mechanic sounds like it could be ripe for shit work conditions (physical job, being out in the elements, having to go on location physically 100% of the time, working for extremely low-profit-margin companies, I would think that it's only decent if it's got a strong union and that in itself will be a barrier for you getting into it) - Consider how you evaluate companies during job interviews. Focus on finding out if the company, manager, and team is the right fit for you. Spend less headspace on trying to impress the company and make sure they are impressing you. (I am not sure if this is true but I think a lot of candidates who do this in interviews are perceived as knowing what they're doing because they are expressing a very clear idea of what they want out of the role) - There are other ways to use software developer skills that aren't a software development job directly. One example is working on the customer side in pre-sales or post-sales. reply",

With no degree, but a skill and interest in programming coupled with experience, you're actually in a pretty good place. Find a company that doesn't suck. They seem elusive but they exist. They might not pay as well, but you can get through the day without counting the seconds until it's over. Shit companies are always hiring because they have high turnover, so it would seem like all companies are shit, but they are not. Maybe get out of NYC.

It was fun for a while, but I missed having a challenge and feeling like I had a stake in what I’m working on. I now work remotely in a town that has nothing to do with tech, and my friends here work largely in tourism and real estate. They all get treated like shit compared to software engineers.

You might find that doing software at a big boring European company wildly different from tech In manhattan. If you start applying now the job could be your pathway to residency.

          "text": "These days I would like to pair this with a database of the supply chain of products which identifiers were parts are sourced from etc... I could then enter some preferences like \"avoid products from countries engaging in genocide\" and after scanning such a product it could tell me if a product failed one of my filters. I did some research towards this end and found some existing tools that could be useful: - https://github.com/Forceu/barcodebuddy/ (Barcode system for Grocy) - https://world.openfoodfacts.org/ (Open Food Facts is a food products database made by everyone, for everyone. You can use it to make better food choices, and as it is open data, anyone can re-use it for any purpose.) We tend to think that our only power is at the voting both and there it often feels negligible. I believe that we actually hold a lot of economic power through our consumption choices, especially those of us in first world economies or with higher income. Not only could this be more influential that casting a vote every four or five years, but it actually gives you the opportunity to express a much more nuanced view rather than picking one of two (or a handful of) politicians who represent a portfolio of policies that might not be that different from each other (thus offering no real choice) or where you have to pick the lesser of two evils (thus implicitly endorsing policies you disagree with). Currently this economic power is largely squandered (except for extreme cases like boycotts), like misaligned magnetic dipoles in a ferromagnet cancelling each other out in the absence of an external magnetic field. If instead we could get all the individuals to align, consumers in the economic force case or atomic or molecular magnetic dipoles in the magnetism case, then the same collection of individuals is able to produce a powerful force field with real effects. reply",

          "text": "I am not sure how the system for most grocery stores works now, but in the ancient past there was a central authority that set the prices for individual stores (so in Australia, the Coles or Woolworths all have individualised prices per store for items except for advertised sale items). The computer in the store that drives the POS scanners then can print out the shelf label stickers and a poor sod goes and replaces the stickers on the shelves. This is all a big secret of course, so asking a grocery store for their prices is going to get you nowhere. You could try scraping the websites, but often the price for online shopping is different to what is in store. Best bet would be to offer an incentive for people to scan their receipts into your app.  I don't know what kind of incentive you could build to do that, maybe for every 5 receipts you could offer a coupon or something.  Not much of an idea and a massive PITA, it would also only give prices on those things that people bought. edit:  also gets complicated for multi-item discounts or combination discounts reply",

          "text": "It's hard to pinpoint the problem, because I love and adore Rust. So, thank you for all the work you have put in -- it's a great language. I feel like my biggest struggle is simply how hard (tedious?) it is to properly work with generics and some more complex applications of traits. Any time I am working with (especially writing, somehow reading is easier) these, I always take an ungodly amount of time to do anything productive. I am almost certainly sure this is a skill issue -- I am simply not \"Rusting\" like I am supposed to. Maybe I overuse generics, maybe I rely on traits too much, maybe I am trying to abstract stuff away too much. But this is one of the reasons I want to also explore other languages in the space, especially ones which make it impossible for me to make this so complex. Don't get me wrong -- all of this complexity is a joy to work with when I can use my brain. But sometimes, it's just too much effort to do stuff, and it feels like I could be getting away with less. Curiously, I never had a problem with the borrow checker, even though people often complaining about how much it forces them to \"stop and think\". Another thing is that C, for some weird reason, always feels \"lower level\" than Rust, and seeing it gives me some sort of weird satisfaction that Rust does not. Maybe it's just a greener grass syndrome, but wanted to mention it nonetheless. All this said, I want to just emphasise, that despite this shortcoming (if it even is one), if I were forced to choose a language to spend the rest of my life with, I would not be the least bit sad to only ever use Rust again.

Is this related to the problem where, if you want to put a generic in a data structure (e.g. an implementation of `Write`), you find yourself propagating a generic bound up an entire hierarchy of data structures and functions using those structures? Asking because one thing that's common amongst Rust developers is a bit of an aversion to using `dyn Trait` types, and using a `Box<dyn Write>` (for instance) in the right place can wildly simplify your program. > But sometimes, it's just too much effort to do stuff, and it feels like I could be getting away with less. The next times you find this feeling arising, please feel free to reach out, if you'd like; I would genuinely love to hear about it. You can reach me by DM on the Rust Zulip, or by the email in my profile. > Another thing is that C, for some weird reason, always feels \"lower level\" than Rust, and seeing it gives me some sort of weird satisfaction that Rust does not. Maybe it's just a greener grass syndrome, but wanted to mention it nonetheless. I was originally a C developer, and I can sympathize. I don't tend to crave that \"lower level\" feeling often, but for me, there was something satisfying about C in the old DOS days, where you could make a pointer to video memory and scribble on it. reply",

That doesn't only apply to languages that offer fewer guarantees than Rust, but also to languages that are possibly less low-level (e.g. OCaml, Nim). But even for educational purposes, using a language with a poor selection of libraries is likely to lead to a bad experience if what you want to produce is working, non-trivial software.

That means proving properties of your code, implying Rice's theorem. It doesn't. Rice's theorem talks about the undecidability of proving some arbitrary property of arbitrary programs, but given a property, one can construct a language in which it trivially holds for all programs in the language. This is done by finding an inductive invariant -- one that is preserved by all program operations -- that implies the property. Let me give you an example. Due to Rice's theorem, it is undecidable whether or not the output of an arbitrary program that yields a number output is even. Nevertheless, it's easy to construct a language (even a Turing-complete one) where this property always holds. We find a stronger invariant -- all numbers in the program are even -- that can be easily made inductive. Indeed, even numbers are closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication, while for every division operation we add a runtime check that panics if the result is odd (and, of course, the compiler rejects any literal that isn't even). And voila! Not every program that yields an even output can be written in this language, but every program in this language yields an even output. To see that this is what Rust does with memory safety, note that while every program in safe Rust is memory-safe, not every memory-safe program can be written in safe Rust. > If it's easy (doable) to go 100% memory safe, then there should be a trivial way to always rely on memory guarantees. No need for a spectrum. The need for the spectrum arises because we want to sacrifice 100% memory-safety for other things, such as Java's ability to call C code. > The spectrum exist because rather than writing OS in Ada, programmers collectively decided to bury their heads into C.

But it isn't because you assume that a language that makes more guarantees will always produce more correct programs per unit of effort, but we know that to be false . From the vantage point of ATS and Idris, a language like Rust is almost indistinguishable from C. There are a few more properties it guarantees than C does, but ATS/Idris can be used to guarantee any program property. If what I said is a nirvana fallacy, then you must not use Rust and always use ATS, because it is much better on your definition of better. The reason we don't is that we know more sound guarantees are not always better, but we didn't always know that. In the seventies, software correctness researchers (such as Tony Hoare) assumed that the only path to scaling software would be soundness (proofs, and even formal proofs). As time went on, we learnt that this belief was false from both sides: unsound methods proved surprisingly effective [1], and proofs proved costly to scale, to the point that they made achieving a required level of correctness more costly. > If you avoid things that are hard, you'll never grow. If a programming language you learned didn't cause headaches, it's not a programming language, it's a dialect. The problem is not in learning new languages. The problem is that more sound guarantees can sometimes reduce the cost of correctness and sometimes increase it. Don't get me wrong: Soundness and proofs sometimes work very well, but we in the software correctness/formal methods world know that things are much more complicated than \"more soundness more better\".

I'm talking about your general point that more soundness is always better, and your claim that my argument is an example of a nirvana fallacy because I compare an imperfect solution to a hypothetical perfect one.

The problem is not that more soundness isn't perfect, but that there are currently better solutions than more soundness in some situations. You seem to be unaware of the shift in software correctness since the seventies. The gap between the size of programs we can prove correct using deductive methods (currently ~10KLOC) and the size of programs produced in industry is only growing. That is why there's been a shift from deductive proofs to methods such as concolic testing (e.g. KLEE).

I was giving an example of how we make undecidable properties trivial in languages. It can be any property. It's easy to see that Rust does the same with memory safety, i.e. through an inductive invariant, because every statement in Rust maintains the invariant. > Yes, but it relies very little on human verification. Of course. It shouldn't rely on human verification at all. That's how we design type systems. But because an inductive invariant is inherently conservative and must reject correct programs, there is additional human effort required -- not to verify the property, but to stay within the confines of the inductive invariant. In Rust terms, the compiler takes care of memory safety, but you need to put an effort into expressing memory-safe programs in Rust to fit within Rust's constraints, which are, necessarily more restrictive than memory safety (because they must use an inductive invariant). > And I'm saying it as a programmer field we should monotonically approach the ideal by removing languages that don't support it.

No one is suggesting that, it's just that what you're referring to as seatbelts could sometimes do more harm than good even for safety. We have empirical evidence that real seatbelts increase safety; things are nowhere near as clear for language soundness. Sure, C is so exceptionally weak that we can do better than that, and there's no doubt Rust is better on correctness than C, but that's not the same as saying Rust is better on correctness than any language that makes fewer guarantees than Rust. Why? Because, again, we've seen that the benefits of soundness are not linear -- they help until they start hurting. Knowing where that point is is not easy. reply",

I am not calling for perfect. Quite the opposite. I am saying that software correctness is extremely complicated, and even the biggest researchers in the field have been surprised by outcomes that were counterintuitive to them. Yet you seem to have decided that Rust gives the best results of everything that's available, while I have my doubts, especially because I see how people are turning away from Rust and how much it struggles to capture a significant portion of the low-level programming market even at its quite advanced age. I don't think there's a single language in the top ten that's had such low adoption at Rust's current age, and that's not the kind of thing you expect to see with a technology whose excited but small fanbase claim to hit an excellent pragmatic sweet spot. > We have empirical evidence that Rust has measurable impact on bugs, especially memory safety ones. Compared to C, yes. That's exactly what you expect if more sound guarantees help and then hurt -- a language with some sound guarantees to be better than a language with virtually none.

The print statement honestly takes up most of the file, cause its a combination of vararg in the macro with _Generic selector with functions defined on how to print each type of variable.

          "text": "One iterative approach; step zero, though, is to be sure you understand what the bug is : • What happens? • What did you expect to happen? If they're the same then NOT A BUG, and WONTFIX :D Assuming it's a bug, the next important thing is to be able to reproduce it. Ideally with a test case. A test case allows you to: • Rapidly test whether your fix (when you have one) has worked • Ensure that the bug doesn't reoccur (avoid \"regressions\") Sometimes it can be very hard to reproduce a bug, but of course if you can't reproduce it you will never be sure your fixes have worked. The bug spotting process consists of iterations of: • Gather data • Form hypothesis • Test hypothesis It's basically the scientific method. Data can be all sorts of things; events occurring in logs, facts about the user's interaction, versions of databases etc. If you have no hypothesis about what's going on, gather more data until you do. Oh and write your data, hypothesis, and test results down somewhere so you don't get into loops of trying the same thing or think you've tested things that you haven't or know things that you don't. A hypothesis can be as simple as \"maybe it's the version of the database\" and the test being \"change the version of the database and see if the bug disappears\" ... or it could be something more complicated and convoluted (\"When this thread does this thing and that one races it to do this other thing with this particular piece of input data then....\") If you were able to reproduce the problem, your hypothesis was correct and the test indicated that you had resolved it, then you're good to go. Then it comes back next week and you discover it was slightly more complicated than that ;) It's a skill and it improves with practice. Good luck. --- Edit: Originally I wrote \"two approaches\" but then realised I really just have this one, but one variant of it is \"I recognise something I had at the back of my mind when I was writing the code in the first place\" - but that's really just that I already have the data, form the hypothesis off the back of that, and still have to test it to be sure. Also, before you WONTFIX ... do consider why your expectations and the reporters' expectations conflict. Is your documentation confusing? Are your expectations out of whack with what real users want? Most people aren't just idiots, so a raised bug usually indicates that something is wrong even if it's not the code. reply",

          "text": "It's definitely not a dumb question - it's something that just wasn't taught at all when I was at University. My answer, of course, is a bit broad-sweeps. The nitty gritty will depend on the project etc. In your case, if it was flagged as \"good first issue\" it's probably a relatively small self-contained bug (or the reviewer thought that - they might have been wrong). Well worth seeing if one of the project members can give you a hint. I wish I could point you to more material but I don't have much at my fingertips. There's a chapter on debugging in \"The Practice of Programming\" by Rob Pike that I recall being good, but it might be a bit antiquated. It's worth bearing in mind that there are innumerable different types of bugs and different languages are more or less vulnerable to some of them (e.g. you'll never use-after-free in Java, but you can leak memory just as easily in Java as in C++ - and out-of-memory issues might be a little more likely in a profligate language like Java) For C++ there are some excellent books by Scott Meyers which, if they've been updated (I was last a C++ dev before 2000) contain a host of little gotchas that can lead to all sorts of weird problems. But hopefully the one you're investigating will be something more straight-forward. >  You are very kind person. Thanks. It's genuinely a pleasure; I think this is a super-interesting topic. Also I think that debugging is one of the most fun bits of software development - though I know a lot of people would disagree with that! reply",

For ChatGPT, you can write, \"Without looking it up, tell me about the Marathon crater.\" This tests self awareness. A two-year-old will answer it correctly, as will the dumbest person you know. The correct answer is \"I don't know\". This works because: 1. Training sets consist of knowledge we have, and not of knowledge we don't have. 2. Commitment bias. Complaint chat models will be trained to start with \"Certainly! The Marathon Crater is a geological formation\", or something like that, and from there, the next most probable tokens are going to be \"in Greece\", \"on Mars\" or whatever. At this point, all tokens that are probable are also incorrect. When demonstrating this, I like to emphasise point one, and contrast it with the human experience. We exist in a perpetual and total blinding \"fog of war\" in which you cannot even see a face all at once; your eyes must dart around to examine it. Human experience is structured around _acquiring_ and _forgoing_ information, rather than _having_ information. reply",

You ask them to build a flying submarine and by God they'll build one, dammit! They'd dutifully square circles and trisect angles too, if those particular special cases weren't plastered all over a million textbooks they ingested in training. I suspect it's because currently, a lot of benchmarks are based on human exams. Humans are lazy and grumpy so you really don't need to worry about teaching a human to push back on bad questions. Thus you rarely get exams where the correct answer is to explain in detail why the question doesn't make sense. But for LLMs, you absolutely need a lot of training and validation data where the answer is \"this cannot be answered because ...\". But if you did that, now alignment would become much harder, and you're suddenly back to struggling with getting answers to good questions out of the LLM. So it's probably some time off. reply",

Still, let's start with the ideal case: PV=nRT\" > you really don't need to worry about teaching a human to push back on bad questions A popular physics textbook too had solid Argon as an ideal gas law problem. Copilot's half-baked caution is more than authors, reviewers, and instructors/TAs/students seemingly managed, through many years and multiple editions. Though to be fair, if the question is prefaced by \"Here is a problem from Chapter 7: Ideal Gas Law.\", Copilot is similarly mindless. Asked explicitly \"What is the phase state of ...\", it does respond solid. But as with humans, determining that isn't a step in the solution process. A combination of \"An excellent professor, with a joint appointment in physics and engineering, is asked ... What would be a careful reply?\" and then \"Try harder.\" was finally sufficient. > you rarely get exams where the correct answer is to explain in detail why the question doesn't make sense Oh, if only that were commonplace. Aspiring to transferable understanding. Maybe someday? Perhaps in China? Has anyone seen this done? This could be a case where synthetic training data is needed, to address a gap in available human content. But if graders are looking for plug-n-chug...

I was going to write something up about this topic but it is surprisingly difficult. I also don't have any concrete examples jumping to mind, but really think how many questions could honestly be responded to with \"it depends\" - like my kid asked me how much milk should a person drink in a day. It depends: ask a vegan, a Hindu, a doctor, and a dairy farmer. Which answer is correct? The kid is really good at asking simple questions that absolutely do not have simple answers when my goal is to convey as much context and correct information as possible. Furthermore, just because an answer appears in context more often in the training data doesn't mean it's (more) correct. Asserting it is, is fallacious.

          "text": "Grok 3 Marathon Crater, likely a confusion with Marathon Valley on Mars, wasn't \"discovered\" in the traditional sense as a distinct crater. Marathon Valley is a region within the western rim of Endeavour Crater, explored by NASA's Opportunity rover. The valley itself came to prominence when Opportunity arrived there in July 2015, as it was targeted for study due to clay mineral detections by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s CRISM instrument in 2009. Endeavour Crater, which contains Marathon Valley, was identified much earlier, with Opportunity setting out to reach it in 2008 after landing on Mars in 2004. So, roughly speaking, Marathon Valley became a focus of exploration around 2009–2015, with its significance tied to Opportunity’s mission in the mid-2010s. If you meant a specific \"Marathon Crater\" elsewhere, could you clarify? Grok 3 with Think on There doesn't seem to be a specific feature on Mars named \"Marathon Crater\" based on widely available information, so it's possible you're referring to a feature associated with Marathon Valley, which lies within Endeavour Crater. Marathon Valley was identified as a region of scientific interest when the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's CRISM instrument detected clay minerals there, a discovery that took place around 2009. Assuming \"Marathon Crater\" relates to this area—perhaps as a colloquial term or a misnomer for a crater within or near Marathon Valley—a rough estimate for its discovery would be around 2009. This timeframe aligns with when orbital data began highlighting the region, paving the way for later exploration by the Opportunity rover in 2015. reply",

          "text": "Yes, I understand the basics. LLMs predict the next most probable tokens based on patterns in their training data and the prompt context. For the 'Marathon crater' example, the model doesn't have a concept of 'knowing' versus 'not knowing' in our sense. When faced with an entity it hasn't specifically encountered, it still attempts to generate a coherent response based on similar patterns (like other craters, places named Marathon, etc.). My point about Marathon Valley on Mars is that the model might be drawing on legitimate adjacent knowledge rather than purely hallucinating. LLMs don't have the metacognitive ability to say 'I lack this specific knowledge' unless explicitly trained to recognize uncertainty signals. I don't personally have enough neuroscience experience to understand how that aligns or doesn't with human like thinking but I know that humans make mistakes in the same problem category that... to an external observer.. are indistinguishable from \"making shit up\". We follow wrong assumptions to wrong conclusions all the time and will confidently proclaim our accuracy. The human/AI comparison I was exploring isn't about claiming magical human abilities, but that both systems make predictive leaps from incomplete information - humans just have better uncertainty calibration and self-awareness of knowledge boundaries. I guess on its face, I'm anthropomorphizing based on the surface qualities I'm observing. reply",

What I find interesting (and perhaps didn't articulate properly) isn't confusion about the LLM's behavior, but the question of whether human cognition might operate on similar principles at a fundamental level - just via different mechanisms and with better calibration (similar algorithm, different substrate), which is why I used human examples at the start. When I see an LLM confidently generate an answer about a non-existent thing by associating related concepts, I wonder how different is this from humans confidently filling knowledge gaps with our own probability-based assumptions? We do this constantly - connecting dots based on pattern recognition and making statistical leaps between concepts. If we understand how human minds worked in their entirety, then I'd be more likely to say \"ha, stupid LLM, it hallucinates instead of saying I don't know\". But, I don't know, I see a strong similarity to many humans. What are weight and biases but our own heavy-weight neural \"nodes\" built up over a lifetime to say \"this is likely to be true because of past experiences\"?

Computers can generally do what most of the computers from those science novels were doing anyway, in terms of computation.

Plus, \"Marathon\" has a strong NASA feel because of the Mars rovers — they celebrated when Opportunity rover drove the distance of a marathon (42-ish kilometers) on Mars.\nDigging into Memory:\nI remember Opportunity traveled a really long distance over years, and they marked milestones along the way by naming craters it passed.\nThere was a Marathon Valley, but I also vaguely recall a Marathon Crater related to that.\nPutting it Together:\nSo, I reason:\nMarathon Crater must be a relatively small impact crater on Mars.\nIt was likely named during Opportunity’s mission.\nProbably not a huge, dramatic crater like Gale Crater (where Curiosity is); more like a marker on Opportunity’s long journey across the plains (like Meridiani Planum).\nFurther Context Guess:\nSince Opportunity drove a marathon distance, it's very fitting they would name a nearby crater \"Marathon\" to commemorate that achievement — probably around the time it hit the marathon distance milestone.\nConclusion:\nWithout checking, I would say:\nMarathon Crater is a small, relatively shallow crater on Mars that Opportunity rover reached or passed during its mission, around the time it completed a marathon distance traveled on Mars.\nWould you like me to now double-check and see how close (or far) I am?\nOr do you want me to also explain how I'd \"fact-check\" myself if I had to? reply",

          "text": "Claude 3.7 : I'd be happy to tell you about the Marathon crater. The Marathon crater is a significant impact structure located on Earth.\nThe Marathon crater is situated in Ontario, Canada, and is estimated to be about 450 million years old, dating back to the Ordovician period. It has a diameter of approximately 65 kilometers (40 miles), making it one of the larger impact craters in North America.\nThe crater was formed when a meteorite struck the Earth, causing a massive impact that left behind this distinctive geological formation. Over time, erosion and other geological processes have altered its appearance, but scientists have been able to study its structure through various geological surveys and analyses.\nWhat's particularly interesting about the Marathon crater is its size and age, which provide valuable insights into Earth's geological history and past impact events. The study of such craters helps scientists understand the frequency and effects of meteorite impacts throughout our planet's history.\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the Marathon crater, such as its discovery, geological features, or scientific significance? reply",

          "text": "This is the kind of reason why I will never use AI What's the point of using AI to do research when 50-60% of it could potentially be complete bullshit. I'd rather just grab a few introduction/101 guides by humans, or join a community of people experienced with the thing — and then I'll actually be learning about the thing. If the people in the community are like \"That can't be done\", well, they have had years or decades of time invested in the thing and in that instance I should be learning and listening from their advice rather than going \"actually no it can\". I see a lot of beginners fall into that second pit. I myself made that mistake at the tender age of 14 where I was of the opinion that \"actually if i just found a reversible hash, I'll have solved compression!\", which, I think we all here know is bullshit. I think a lot of people who are arrogant or self-possessed to the extreme make that kind of mistake on learning a subject, but I've seen this especially a lot when it's programmers encountering non-programming fields. Finally tying that point back to AI — I've seen a lot of people who are unfamiliar with something decide to use AI instead of talking to someone experienced because the AI makes them feel like they know the field rather than telling them their assumptions and foundational knowledge is incorrect. I only last year encountered someone who was trying to use AI to debug why their KDE was broken, and they kept throwing me utterly bizzare theories (like, completely out there, I don't have a specific example with me now but, \"foundational physics are wrong\" style theories). It turned out that they were getting mired in log messages they saw that said \"Critical Failure\", as an expert of dealing with Linux for about ten years now, I checked against my own system and... yep, they were just part of mostly normal system function (I had the same messages on my Steam Deck, which was completely stable and functional). The real fault was buried halfway through the logs. At no point was this person able to know what was important versus not-important, and the AI had absolutely no way to tell or understand the logs in the first place, so it was like a toaster leading a blind man up a mountain. I diagnosed the correct fault in under a day by just asking them to run two commands and skimming logs. That's experience, and that's irreplaceable by machine as of the current state of the world. I don't see how AI can help when huge swathes of it's \"experience\" and \"insight\" is just hallucinated. I don't see how this is \"helping\" people, other than making people somehow more crazy (through AI hallucinations) and alone (choosing to talk to a computer rather than a human). reply",

You can listen to it and hear how it runs. If a part goes bad, you can easily replace it. If it's having troubles, it will be obvious - it will simply stop working - cutting wood more slowly or not at all. The situation with an LLM is completely different. There's no way to tell that it has a wrong answer - aside from looking for the answer elsewhere which defeats its purpose. It'd be like using a chainsaw all day and not knowing how much wood you cut, or if it just stopped working in the middle of the day. And even if you KNOW it has a wrong answer (in which case, why are you using it?), there's no clear way to 'fix' it. You can jiggle the prompt around, but that's not consistent or reliable. It may work for that prompt, but that won't help you with any subsequent ones. reply",

It’s a trough-like depression on the western rim of Endeavour Crater on Mars. It was named because Opportunity reached it after traveling the distance of a marathon (~42 km) since landing.

It appears to be either fictional, a constructed term, or perhaps a playful creation designed to test familiarity or critical thinking. If you intended this as a test or a trick question, you got me!

His friend looks at the stack and asks him \"how are you going to decide among all those?\" The man grabs half the stack, throws it in the garbage and says \"Simple, I don't hire unlucky people\". Degrees matter when employers don't have the time and/or ability to make a reasonable decision for every candidate. They need ways to eliminate chunks of the applications. Illogical ways of eliminating candidates are acceptable because they are better than having no way. One method that's not completely illogical is to only look at candidates who have degrees. You can get degrees for <15K. For a BSCS you can do WGU for 5/10K. For a MSCS you can do GaTech OMSCS for 7K. Those numbers are small enough that they're almost definitely worth it. But those also cost time, which you will have to decide for yourself if you want to spend. reply",

          "text": "I think you should ask yourself two related but separate questions: 1. Will the CS degree increase your knowledge and problem-solving ability faster than you could without it? 2. Will the credential add substantially to your credibility for hiring managers? The answer to 1 is mostly about your level of self-discipline and ability to learn independently. If you need the stimulus of a structured environment and a peer group to learn at your best, then any accredited program will be helpful, and your ability to pass coding interviews will increase (with a lot of hard work beyond the curriculum). The answer to 2 is pretty straightforward: unless your degree is from a tier 2+ school, the raw credential is of little value, and even tier 2 is not certain. To count, an online degree must be presented by the school as competitive with an on-site degree. Georgia Tech offers such a degree program as a tier 1 school, for example. An unaccredited program is of no value whatsoever in answer to 1 or 2. So, avoid them at any price. You are looking at a 3-5 year project, no matter what, and this is probably a good time to do that. The market will take that long to sort itself out and to realize that vibe coding is NOT the miracle it seems. reply",

          "text": "I take issue with your idea that it is \"tier 2+\" that are the only programs that are worth it. When you make statements like that, or prognostications of that nature, you have to think about how it actually is in reality and not as the kinds of base opinions that are found in Reddit CS careers subs. I think this varies widely for employers and even within teams of large employers, depending on who is the person doing the hiring. Even at a simplistic level having a degree from a regionally accredited institutions will decide whether you pass the first HR screen, so it cannot be equivalent to no credential at all. This just fails a basic real world sensibility test. Are you saying a CS grade from Montana State University that is a hiring manager at FAANG (maybe even the most famous one) is going to consider someone with a degree from Stevens or Florida Institute of Technology to be equivalent to someone without a degree? I don't know if you are aware but there many people employed CS grads that did not attend the top 3. Also, I don't know about tiers, but these rankings are largely based on research and not quality of undergraduate program or outcomes. The idea of telling someone that doesn't have a degree that wants to know of if attaining a degree could likely help their career that they should not go if it is not \"tier 2+,\" whatever that is, is just kind of malpractice.  Georgia Tech is not the only school that offers such a degree that is equivalent to their in-person program. I would agree that you should choose a school that has a traditional program for which this online program is just a different modality, rather than one of these online-only predatory type of schools. reply",

That exercise alone will probably give you a good idea of the technical value of the education. I would add that words don't have objective complete meanings. Words are indirect references to ideas and ideas are like raw marble in your head, carved into meaningful shapes by working with and manipulating those ideas. If you bring out a word like \"consistency\", college is very much about shaping the idea behind that word into increasingly more crisp and formal meanings, especially meanings that can then interact with ideas behind other words like \"atomicity\" or \"scale\". reply",

          "text": "As someone who has interviewed candidates for a FANG company in the distant past I can't say that degrees matter, but I can say that people I interviewed with degrees generally did better. There's a hidden bias in that this is only people who got through recruiters and recruiters are their own filter. Strong referrals usually guaranteed a phone screens. I think previous experience at a major competitor in the same tier or a degree from a top CS school were also meaningful, but I don't know how else they filtered. There is a non trivial relationship between colleges and businesses, so you are likely to do many problems in college that are not terribly different from the interview questions. Additionally all of your peers have been interviewed/do interviews/do referrals and that does matter. College students generally did not do incredibly well on practical problems, so I would expect a non college candidate to do really well on them. Many of the best co-workers that I remember had physics degrees. In fact, it was so pronounced I personally consider a physics degree to be a top tier signal of programming ability, but that's my own personal prejudice. If your degree isn't from a top 10-20 CS school it's probably not worth it if you have experience. If you can't make friends while doing the courses, then I don't think it's worth it. Going to a good college is much much much much more than a few lectures, some book reading, and some assignments. It is face to face time with world class experts, it's a culture, it's social, it's exploratory. You can potentially work on bleeding edge research or be introduced to things you never knew existed. It sounds like your idea of what college is, is that it's a technical education rather than a liberal education. If that's true I think your perception of college is wrong. There are some situations where a college degree really matters. If you want to apply for a work visa in a foreign country, a degree from a good college can potentially get your application a rubber stamp or lack of one could completely restrict you from it. reply",

It also involves the most work and involves the most risk of rejection…things we are often wired to avoid. You have to get way down the road before failing a Leet Code problem is even possible. And six months of grinding on professional networking are much more likely to bear fruit. Both in the short term and in the long term because Leet Code is neither work experience, nor knowing someone. In addition,  there is a tendency to approach Leet Code as “level two fizz-buzz” based on the examples. That’s not how companies are likely to use it. Instead, they test candidate code with “interesting size data” so that “fizzy-buzzy” solutions fall over. Just as they will in production. Maybe that’s not you…but if Leet Code problems don’t look like what you do daily at work or something you struggled against in a class that used “interesting size data” grinding may not get you anywhere. Except avoiding the rejection and networking of a job search. Good luck. reply",

I have been a large part of driving the app forward, both technically and in terms of the product. I have been a software engineer for 10 years and have a degree in Computer Science. Some highlights of things I have worked on include new CI pipelines (automated testing, creating new app targets for manual testing and more), universal/app links, Swift and Java native modules, automated “real device” testing using AWS device farm and Maestro, spinning up our own CodePush server on AWS, and many features written in TypeScript. The app is not written with the Expo framework so I have had a lot of opportunities to understand React Native more - but open to working on an Expo app. I want to remain focussing on React Native although I’d love the opportunity to write more Swift/Java, and also open to working on the web some of the time.

Email: see resumé Technologies: technical writing, hardware testing, performance analysis, data visualization If you need to know whether your product is competitive, need that assertion backed up by data, and need to clearly communicate about it in any medium, I can help. I've spent over 10 years testing and writing about PC hardware, both in media and as a technical marketer for ASUS and most recently Intel. I'm also an obsessive editor who can help any team produce clean, well-structured, highly readable copy. At Intel, I was responsible for full-stack competitive analysis of Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA GPUs for desktop and mobile systems, from add-in boards and laptop hardware all the way up through drivers, supporting software, the quality/usefulness of functional units like hardware video encoders, and developer features like the XeSS and DLSS upscalers. I also helped build out a team for pre-release game testing to identify performance wins and to spot issues for our dev teams. During my time at The Tech Report (RIP), I selected benchmarks and generated and analyzed performance data for the latest and greatest CPUs from Intel and AMD and GPUs from AMD and NVIDIA. Our testing methods were especially focused on quantifying a smooth and responsive gaming experience by using frame-time analysis. I also reviewed pretty much anything else that went into or around a PC, like motherboards, monitors, etc. Outside of work, I'm an avid hobbyist photographer, videographer, and Twitch streamer, so I have well-developed eyes and ears for quality beyond the written word too. reply",

I'm a full-stack engineer with several years of experience working within in the JS and Ruby ecosystems. I recently co-created Frame, an image-based semantic search platform built for developers ( https://www.frame-platform.com ). It abstracts away infrastructure for developers who want to embed images and perform similarity search quickly through an AWS deployment. I worked across the stack on this project, from initial prototyping and design to final implementation and documentation. For my next role, I'm looking for a fast-paced environment where I can grow as an engineer. I love picking up new technologies and have a proven track record of learning quickly. I'd prefer a remote role, but I am open to relocating anywhere in the U.S. Please get in touch with me if you feel like there might be a fit :) reply",

The tool suggests which cuts to make and where, given a restricted fall path (e.g. constrained by a neighbors yard on one side). I create the fallen branches in their final state along the fall plane, and create individual correction vectors mapping them back to their original state, but in an order that does not intersect other branch vectors. The idea came to me as a particularly difficult tree needed to come down in my friends yard, and we spent hours planning it out. I've already gotten some interest from the tree-surgeon community, I just need to appify it. Second rendition will treat the problem more as a physics one than a graph one, with some energy-minimisation methods for solving. reply",

          "text": "Having joined may father and his friend during the process of cutting down big trees in the village neighborhood I can personally vouch that this indeed a cumbersome and very complex task for both the planning and the execution phases. However, for us the tasks are made easier by the trimming of the tree's branches since my father's friend is the expert tree climber. From your descriptions, it seems that your tree cutting procedures do not involved precut of the tree's branches before cutting the tree down. I've got the feeling that this cutting tree problem can be solved by constraint programming techniques [1],[2]. Alternatively generic tools for constraint programming, for example OR-Tools and MiniZinc can probably do the same if not better [3],[4].

Strap it to the tree, turn it on, walk away and some minutes later the tree falls down.  The main difficulty is in how to drive the wire.  Using friction would create fast wearing parts.  Maybe a chain could be used instead of a wire.  It could oscillate back and forth, instead of having to be wrapped and spliced to form a circle around the tree.  It seems really strange that no one has come up with an alternative to chain saws for decades (except for large scale trucks that can process whole trees.)  For small trees and branches even a sawz-all is safer than a chain saw.  Inspired by spending some time sharing a hospital room with a guy who had a chain saw accident, but I still haven't come up with a workable idea.  Maybe someone else can. reply",

The kind that involves decades' worth of it, thanks to what I'll just say is a lot of maintenance that wasn't done over a long time. There's an extensive amount of brush, leaves, etc of varying ages that could maybe be shredded up into something useful, invasive vines I'm still trying to deal with, and more old trash than I've fully figured out how to properly dispose of. It's turning into various DIY rabbit holes, actually, with the next one (outside of various related landscaping stuff) being to gut a basement. reply",

          "text": "You can start right now with an algorithm I learned from an expert when I was working in a landscaping business. It is a very simple three-pass plan: \"Deadwood, Crossovers, Aesthetics\". So, first pass, go through the tree cutting out only and all the dead branches. Cut back to live stock, and as always make good clean angle cuts at a proper angle (many horticulture books will provide far better instructions on this). Second pass, look only for branches that cross-over other branches and especially those that show rubbing or friction marks against other branches.  Cut the ones that are either least healthy or grow in the craziest direction (i.e., crazy away from the normal more-or-less not radially away from the trunk). Then, and only after the other two passes are complete, start pruning for the desired look and/or size & shape for planned growth or bearing fruit. This method is simple and saves a LOT of ruined trees from trying to first cut to size and appearance, then by the time the deadwood and crossovers are taken later, it is a scraggly mess that takes years to grow back.  And it even works well for novices, as long as they pay attention. I'd suspect entering the state and direction of every branch to an app would take longer than just pruning with the above method, although for trees that haven't fully leafed out, perhaps a 360° angle set of drone pics could make an adequate 3D model to use for planning? In any case, good luck with your fruit trees — may they grow healthy and provide you with great bounty for many years! reply",

I didn't normalize everything but did have many of the staples like milk and eggs normalized; some products had multiple units (eg, \"bananas - each\" vs \"bananas - pound\"); and a lot of my comparisons were done based on the store (eg, I was often comparing \"Potatoes - 20#\" at Costco but \"Potatoes - 5#\" at Target over time). Anyway, Costco didn't always win, but in my experience, they frequently did -- $5 peanut butter @ Costco vs $7.74 @ Target based on whatever size and brand I got, which is interesting because Costco doesn't have \"generic\" PB, whereas Target has much cheaper Market Pantry, and I tried to opt for that. reply",

          "text": "Personally it feels like every issue gets shoved under the \"imposter syndrome\" umbrella, but I'd say you are just feeling a bit of cultural shock or cultural mismatch. The other thing is software developed by large teams tend to be complex, and a new-comer needs more time to understand what's happening. Onboarding can be a very chaotic process especially for teams who don't specifically put a lot of effort into making it smooth for new-comers. This isn't imposter syndrome but rather something that your team probably needs to do better. The complexity you are probably going to have to get used to. Maybe some of it is unnecessary, but just like the naïve developer trying to refactor/rewrite a complex piece of code realizes, the extra exceptions and special cases were added for some reason and without them the code breaks in various niche situations. (Or maybe they're really unnecessary! The thing is until you get a full grasp of the code, you won't know) Otherwise just give it a couple months and see how well you adjust. I think just keep an open mind and don't assume things only because other people have different backgrounds from yours. (I mean, what does age have to do with this? You're only a couple years older than those \"fresh 20 year old kids\", not even \"old\"...) reply",

          "text": "At twelve years in, you are expected to be a senior engineer and to be able to bootstrap yourself into a new dev environment without someone leading you to do so.  How you go about doing that, especially in a chaotic environment with aggressive schedules, will become your image with your peers. One technique I would advise is to use 'git blame' (and/or conversations with your engineering and product managers) to identify authors of components (or even just chunks of code) that you are struggling to understand, and then set up short 1-on-1 meetings with those authors to discuss the system architecture from the perspective of the component(s) that they have written.  Rinse.  Repeat. Remember, as you go about this, that what you are really doing here is building a living network of the tribal knowledge graph within your company, so be kind and respectful.  Further, consider starting making a guide book of sorts, both for yourself as well as for subsequent new hires, especially more junior engineers (who you may need or want to mentor). Don't worry.  You've got this.  Best of luck! reply",

They don’t understand what it means to support something in production through its lifecycle, and don’t care, because they always have one foot out the door. It’s probably worth sticking it out, as having 1-2 years there will look good on a resume, while a month will not. I’ve dealt with imposter syndrome most of my career. You never really know how you’re being perceived by others until they tell you. I went into a review a couple years ago 100% certain that I was going to be shredded, because I felt like I had really been phoning it in and the boss had made some comments very early on when he took over the team. When I showed up to the review I was met with 45 minutes of praise. After it was over I just sat there for 15 minutes in shock. I couldn’t seem to integrate the false reality my imposter syndrome created in my head with the reality of what just happened. Your expectations for yourself and the company might need time to align with the reality of how the business actually runs.

What you are describing is actually the other side of imposter syndrome. It’s the I know exactly what I am doing and can force this to work if I just cut out all the boilerplate bullshit but will never figure this out without some internal documentation. This is why Bank of America teams in India were running circles around their American counterparts. They (the India teams) recognized this stupidity early, documented the shit out of it, and then wrote scripts for most of it. The imposters were the people refusing to recognize and confront the internal stupidity openly and transparently. My suggestion to you, having gone through this many times, is dominate other peoples time. It does not matter how busy they are. This shit is not working and someone needs to show you why. Be very clear about this with your team. Then write your own personal documentation. reply",

          "text": "So, let’s assume the child in question lives in a household without trauma, is not neurodivergent, and is otherwise emotionally stable. In that case what works best is reinforcement. Reward good behavior with praise and treats while punishing bad behavior both emotionally and with reprisals. It’s the same as training a dog and it works well with children, especially when there are multiple iterations and parental consistency. For children with trauma this might require extended learning time. For children with autism there is not a straightforward or predictable answer. As a parent you must accept the reality that when your child starts school they are entering a world beyond your control under rules and influences that are not your own. If, as a parent, you cannot stomach that loss of control, you might have to consider home schooling. This is something every parent goes through. reply",

          "text": "Have you heard of I Can Problem Solve (ICPS)? There are four rungs of a \"ladder\" where we want to get to the top, problem-solving. In descending order, we get explanations (if..that), suggestions (\"Tell her you're sorry.\"), and power (the bottom rung): \"Go to time-out!\" Cover of such a book: https://openlibrary.org/books/OL27073744M/I_Can_Problem_Solv... --- Five basic principles, applicable to children as young as age 4, underlie the dialoguing process. The only prerequisite is that children understand the basic word concepts used by the adult. Relatively consistent application of these principles in time helps children associate their newly acquired thinking skills with what they do and how they behave. First, both child and teacher must identify the problem. Casually saying, \"What happened?\"; \"What's the matter?\" or \"Tell me about it\" not only helps the child clarify the problem but also ensures that you will not jump to a faulty conclusion about what is going on. For example, \"Oh, now I see what the problem is. I thought you were mad because your friend took your truck. Now I see it's because she played with it too long and won't give it back.\" Discovering the child's view of the problem starts the dialoguing process on the proper course. Second, when dialoguing, it is important to understand and deal with the real problem. The child in the preceding example thinks he has already shared his truck with his friend, but the teacher may see this child grab the truck and erroneously assume that grabbing is the problem. Actually, grabbing is the child's solution to the problem of getting his truck back, not the problem itself. The real problem is that the child wants his truck back. Third, once the real problem has been identified, the teacher must not alter it to fit his or her own needs. Suppose that the teacher becomes intention showing the child in the example how to share his toys. Because the child is thinking only about how to get back a toy he knows he has already shared, the teacher's guidance will likely lead to resistance. In this case, attempting to teach the \"right\" thing to do may backfire. Fourth, the child, not the teacher, must solve the problem. If the child is to develop the habit of thinking of his own solutions to problems and considering the potential consequences of his actions, he must be encouraged to think for himself. More than simply \"listening\" to the child, the teacher must actively draw out what the child thinks caused the problem, how he and others feel about the situation, his ideas about how to solve the difficulty, and what he thinks might happen if he were to put those ideas into action. In highlighting the child's thinking, the teacher does not offer solutions to the problem or suggest what might happen next. When not bombarded with \"don'ts\" or offered a stream of \"do's,\" the child is freed to think through the problem and decide for himself what and what not to do. The teacher only asks questions and, through these, guides and encourages the emergence of problem-solving thinking. Finally, the focus is on how the child thinks, not on what he thinks (in other words, the specific conclusions he comes to). Research on the ICPS program suggests that the process of a child's thinking is more important in the long run than the content of a specific solution. Attention is therefore focused on developing a style of thinking that will help the child deal with interpersonal problems in general, not on solving the immediate problem to the teacher's satisfaction (although this often occurs). Praising a solution may inhibit further thought about other ideas. Criticizing a solution may inhibit the child's speaking freely about what is on his mind. In either case, the child's thinking will shift from generating options, consequences, and causes to selecting the one thing that meets with teacher approval. In applying these principles, the teacher transmits to the child the value judgment that thinking is important, and the child learns that thinking meets with adult approval. When Not to Dialogue It is not possible or even necessary to dialogue every problem that comes up. In fact, there are times when dialoguing is not effective and its use is better postponed. Clearly, if a child has been or is likely to be physically harmed, your first priority is to help by removing the child from danger. reply",

          "text": "Hey, I’m a parent of a child with severe Tourettes and ADHd. I just thought I’d share my 2c worth: While all kids struggle with disinhibition, it sounds like your child might have a harder time with inhibiting unwanted behaviours (so struggling with disinhibition). This is actually quite common in a lot of children, and nothing to be too concern about, although if it’s disruptive to his own education and opportunities for socialising with other kids, you will need some form of extra support. Your child is not naughty or bad on purpose, rather, a better way to frame it is their nervous system might be a bit more reactive and a little bit more impulsive that some other kids.  Understanding that can help inform better strategies for managing it. My main question is, is your child showing any signs of trying to regulate himself already that you can leverage? \nIt took me a while to realise that my son was regulating in ways I wasn’t recognising because I didn’t understand his struggle. An example was that for a while he had a tic where every time he picked up a pen he had the urge to throw it at a wall. So he stopped using pens. The school panicked and tried to say he was autistic and regressing. But once someone eventually asked him why he wouldn’t hold a pen, he just told us, it was because he didn’t want to throw them. Once they realise that, they gave him a computer to type with instead. So looking for the ways he may be already regulating himself that might not make sense to you but make sense to him will also start to help you understand what is driving the behaviours. Another point I want to make though is that mainstream school is genuinely a very damaging place for kids who struggle with behaviour/conduct issues/disinhibition. Schools isolate these children, and they ostracise them, thereby sabotaging the child’s access to equitable education, limiting the opportunities to form healthy friendships with peers and destroying their self-esteem, basically effectively reinforcing antisocial behaviours. I think if you have the resources you should consider alternative schooling options like Montessori type schools, private schools, private tutoring, or even home schooling. I can guarantee your child is probably an incredibly creative, wonderful person with so much potential, but he’s probably just wired slightly different. Schools don’t foster creativity, they foster uniformity, they don’t foster curiosity, they foster reciting of facts unquestioningly. Western schooling systems also teach people to mindlessly follow authority without questioning it, which also has its repercussions. Your child is probably not the real issue when they’re at school. School will be the issue. Schools/teachers often know very little about paediatric brain development and behaviour. They treat children like mini-adults. Furthermore, teachers are often incredibly overworked under-resourced and underpaid. Even when they want to do better for each individual child, they are not equipped to. My final piece of advice is that no matter how deeply frustrating the behaviours continue to manage your child’s behaviour with firm but fair boundaries, lots of love and reassurance that they are loved, lots of reassurance that they’re intelligent and full of potential, and a great deal of patience. He will naturally grow out of a lot this behaviour. It’s his self-esteem and self efficacy you want to protect a long the way. reply",

          "text": "This will evoke mixed feelings, but having been involved in child development for a very long time, I can say that in some cases it is acceptable to carefully and very thoughtfully \"spank\" your child. Spanking should never be performed out of frustration or anger on your part. There should also always be a delay (at least a short one) between the incident and the spanking so as to allow some processing both for you and your child and to decide if it is right and then for them to internalize the punishment that is about to come. Additionally, spanking, in my opinion and experience, should only be performed when your child had injured someone since injury is something that they cannot restore or pay back. No matter the age, they must be made to understand the reason for such an action of spanking in connection with their action. I would caution, again, that spanking should only be utilized when there is no other restitution possible such as when they are harming another individual. I do not know of any states that directly outlaw such an action by parents, but if there are such laws, obey your laws. Having said this, I would also tell you that you MUST only spank after you have: 0. Make sure your child knows here is this consequence if they injure someone. Let them know there is a consequence! Do not let them think that arbitrary punishments or retribution occurs. This will do more harm than good if you do not set the expectations. It's not entirely possible to always do this the first time or with very, very small children (such as a two year old that has a biting problem as an example and which is very damaging behavior). 1. Explained what is about to happen carefully and fully. 2. Only spank once or a couple of times in a very controlled and sterile manner. Do NOT get emotionally involved in the spanking except to feel bad that you are doing it. DO NOT SPANK IF YOU ARE ANGRY. DON'T DO IT. NEVER. 3. After the spanking show your child MORE love and care. Give them high levels of tenderness and show them that it hurt you to execute this punishment. If you can cry with them, CRY WITH THEM. This is very important to show forth more love after the punishment and by doing this you will actually improve your bond with your child and allow them to know that you harbor no ill will against them. 4. Remind them in the future about the consequences that will occur if they choose to harm someone else as they have done. 5. Always show your child love and always let them know you suffer when they suffer now and always. Learn empathy and if you cannot have it, then show sympathy and love them anyway even if you cannot feel such things yourself. reply",

          "text": "I could not disagree with this more. One of my children has sensory issues, is on the spectrum, and has problems controlling their emotions, and we’ve been able to help them without any physical harm learn to manage their feelings when they anger quickly or have the urge to be violent with another child (including their older sibling). I don’t think spanking is ever warranted, and I’m shocked someone would recommend it. > Research has long underscored the negative effects of spanking on children’s social-emotional development, self-regulation, and cognitive development, but new research, published this month, shows that spanking alters children’s brain response in ways similar to severe maltreatment and increases perception of threats. > “The findings are one of the last pieces of evidence to make sense of the research of the last 50 years on spanking,” says researcher Jorge Cuartas, a Ph.D. candidate at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, who coauthored the study with Katie McLaughlin, professor at the Department of Psychology at Harvard University. “We know that spanking is not effective and can be harmful for children’s development and increases the chance of mental health issues. With these new findings, we also know it can have potential impact on brain development, changing biology, and leading to lasting consequences.” > Perhaps surprisingly, says Cuartas, spanking elicits a similar response in children’s brains to more threatening experiences like sexual abuse. “You see the same reactions in the brain,” Cuartas explains. “Those consequences potentially affect the brain in areas often engaged in emotional regulation and threat detection, so that children can respond quickly to threats in the environment.” https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/usable-knowledge/21/04/eff... https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cdev.13... reply",

You don't want to be the FAANG \"cattle, not pets\" One of the most enjoyable jobs I had was working for a small company that made [digital] audio equipment (before that was possible on a PC) - we had sound systems in every office and a small recording studio in the basement.

Stay away from the big tech companies, look for something small and somewhat local. This is good advice. I'm a dev in a manufacturing company (admittedly quite a large one) and the culture here is very different to pure software businesses I've worked in. There are deadlines, but they're realistic. People go home on-time. Little or no fashion-driven development practices and platform churn, mostly just pragmatism and an emphasis on stuff that works. I share a building with proper engineers (mechanical, electrical) as well as other devs and the culture is so refreshing. When you look around, there are lots of businesses like this just quietly getting on with things. reply",

I would question whether the problem is that you don't want to be in the field at all, or that you are fed up with specific positions/companies that are a poor fit for you. You only have 4 jobs in your history, and having 3 of them suck can be pretty gloomy. So maybe consider doing contract-to-hire, where you're working 6 month (or so) contracts. That lets you sample the work environment at different companies and when you find one that works well for you, you'd have the option to stay as a permanent employee. reply",

          "text": "Great advice from the parent comment. I'll throw these random ideas in along with it: - Work/life balance is something you enforce on your own. Learn to get over fear of being fired (an emergency fund helps) and simply refuse to follow unspoken toxic overwork culture. I have found that more likely than not, nobody actually notices that you aren't working as hard as all the 10x developers that have no life and the people who imitate them. - On the topic of \"field versus company,\" another aspect to keep in mind is that the actual job of software development is very different in different industries. Moving to the same job in a different industry may feel a lot different and have much different norms regarding workload, culture, compensation, etc. - Don't forget that desk jobs in software are still some of the best work you can do overall. Not only is it a desk job where you are generally treated like an adult, it's one of the higher paying ones at that. Think very hard about the grass on the other side of that fence. Your example of aviation mechanic sounds like it could be ripe for shit work conditions (physical job, being out in the elements, having to go on location physically 100% of the time, working for extremely low-profit-margin companies, I would think that it's only decent if it's got a strong union and that in itself will be a barrier for you getting into it) - Consider how you evaluate companies during job interviews. Focus on finding out if the company, manager, and team is the right fit for you. Spend less headspace on trying to impress the company and make sure they are impressing you. (I am not sure if this is true but I think a lot of candidates who do this in interviews are perceived as knowing what they're doing because they are expressing a very clear idea of what they want out of the role) - There are other ways to use software developer skills that aren't a software development job directly. One example is working on the customer side in pre-sales or post-sales. reply",

There are vastly different cultures across different companies, particularly in startups and mid-size. I took a break from city life and regular work for a year while I lived and traveled in an RV doing contract work. It was fun for a while, but I missed having a challenge and feeling like I had a stake in what I’m working on. I now work remotely in a town that has nothing to do with tech, and my friends here work largely in tourism and real estate. They all get treated like shit compared to software engineers. It made me thankful for my place in life. I’m likely moving back to the SF Bay Area after my lease ends here. reply",

You might find that doing software at a big boring European company wildly different from tech In manhattan. If you start applying now the job could be your pathway to residency.

          "text": "\"Tell me about the Marathon crater.\" This works against _the LLM proper,_ but not against chat applications with integrated search. For ChatGPT, you can write, \"Without looking it up, tell me about the Marathon crater.\" This tests self awareness. A two-year-old will answer it correctly, as will the dumbest person you know. The correct answer is \"I don't know\". This works because: 1. Training sets consist of knowledge we have, and not of knowledge we don't have. 2. Commitment bias. Complaint chat models will be trained to start with \"Certainly! The Marathon Crater is a geological formation\", or something like that, and from there, the next most probable tokens are going to be \"in Greece\", \"on Mars\" or whatever. At this point, all tokens that are probable are also incorrect. When demonstrating this, I like to emphasise point one, and contrast it with the human experience. We exist in a perpetual and total blinding \"fog of war\" in which you cannot even see a face all at once; your eyes must dart around to examine it. Human experience is structured around _acquiring_ and _forgoing_ information, rather than _having_ information. reply",

You ask them to build a flying submarine and by God they'll build one, dammit! They'd dutifully square circles and trisect angles too, if those particular special cases weren't plastered all over a million textbooks they ingested in training. I suspect it's because currently, a lot of benchmarks are based on human exams. Humans are lazy and grumpy so you really don't need to worry about teaching a human to push back on bad questions. Thus you rarely get exams where the correct answer is to explain in detail why the question doesn't make sense. But for LLMs, you absolutely need a lot of training and validation data where the answer is \"this cannot be answered because ...\". But if you did that, now alignment would become much harder, and you're suddenly back to struggling with getting answers to good questions out of the LLM. So it's probably some time off. reply",

Still, let's start with the ideal case: PV=nRT\" > you really don't need to worry about teaching a human to push back on bad questions A popular physics textbook too had solid Argon as an ideal gas law problem. Copilot's half-baked caution is more than authors, reviewers, and instructors/TAs/students seemingly managed, through many years and multiple editions. Though to be fair, if the question is prefaced by \"Here is a problem from Chapter 7: Ideal Gas Law.\", Copilot is similarly mindless. Asked explicitly \"What is the phase state of ...\", it does respond solid. But as with humans, determining that isn't a step in the solution process. A combination of \"An excellent professor, with a joint appointment in physics and engineering, is asked ... What would be a careful reply?\" and then \"Try harder.\" was finally sufficient. > you rarely get exams where the correct answer is to explain in detail why the question doesn't make sense Oh, if only that were commonplace. Aspiring to transferable understanding. Maybe someday? Perhaps in China? Has anyone seen this done? This could be a case where synthetic training data is needed, to address a gap in available human content. But if graders are looking for plug-n-chug...

I was going to write something up about this topic but it is surprisingly difficult. I also don't have any concrete examples jumping to mind, but really think how many questions could honestly be responded to with \"it depends\" - like my kid asked me how much milk should a person drink in a day. It depends: ask a vegan, a Hindu, a doctor, and a dairy farmer. Which answer is correct? The kid is really good at asking simple questions that absolutely do not have simple answers when my goal is to convey as much context and correct information as possible. Furthermore, just because an answer appears in context more often in the training data doesn't mean it's (more) correct. Asserting it is, is fallacious.

          "text": "Grok 3 Marathon Crater, likely a confusion with Marathon Valley on Mars, wasn't \"discovered\" in the traditional sense as a distinct crater. Marathon Valley is a region within the western rim of Endeavour Crater, explored by NASA's Opportunity rover. The valley itself came to prominence when Opportunity arrived there in July 2015, as it was targeted for study due to clay mineral detections by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s CRISM instrument in 2009. Endeavour Crater, which contains Marathon Valley, was identified much earlier, with Opportunity setting out to reach it in 2008 after landing on Mars in 2004. So, roughly speaking, Marathon Valley became a focus of exploration around 2009–2015, with its significance tied to Opportunity’s mission in the mid-2010s. If you meant a specific \"Marathon Crater\" elsewhere, could you clarify? Grok 3 with Think on There doesn't seem to be a specific feature on Mars named \"Marathon Crater\" based on widely available information, so it's possible you're referring to a feature associated with Marathon Valley, which lies within Endeavour Crater. Marathon Valley was identified as a region of scientific interest when the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's CRISM instrument detected clay minerals there, a discovery that took place around 2009. Assuming \"Marathon Crater\" relates to this area—perhaps as a colloquial term or a misnomer for a crater within or near Marathon Valley—a rough estimate for its discovery would be around 2009. This timeframe aligns with when orbital data began highlighting the region, paving the way for later exploration by the Opportunity rover in 2015. reply",

          "text": "Yes, I understand the basics. LLMs predict the next most probable tokens based on patterns in their training data and the prompt context. For the 'Marathon crater' example, the model doesn't have a concept of 'knowing' versus 'not knowing' in our sense. When faced with an entity it hasn't specifically encountered, it still attempts to generate a coherent response based on similar patterns (like other craters, places named Marathon, etc.). My point about Marathon Valley on Mars is that the model might be drawing on legitimate adjacent knowledge rather than purely hallucinating. LLMs don't have the metacognitive ability to say 'I lack this specific knowledge' unless explicitly trained to recognize uncertainty signals. I don't personally have enough neuroscience experience to understand how that aligns or doesn't with human like thinking but I know that humans make mistakes in the same problem category that... to an external observer.. are indistinguishable from \"making shit up\". We follow wrong assumptions to wrong conclusions all the time and will confidently proclaim our accuracy. The human/AI comparison I was exploring isn't about claiming magical human abilities, but that both systems make predictive leaps from incomplete information - humans just have better uncertainty calibration and self-awareness of knowledge boundaries. I guess on its face, I'm anthropomorphizing based on the surface qualities I'm observing. reply",

What I find interesting (and perhaps didn't articulate properly) isn't confusion about the LLM's behavior, but the question of whether human cognition might operate on similar principles at a fundamental level - just via different mechanisms and with better calibration (similar algorithm, different substrate), which is why I used human examples at the start. When I see an LLM confidently generate an answer about a non-existent thing by associating related concepts, I wonder how different is this from humans confidently filling knowledge gaps with our own probability-based assumptions? We do this constantly - connecting dots based on pattern recognition and making statistical leaps between concepts. If we understand how human minds worked in their entirety, then I'd be more likely to say \"ha, stupid LLM, it hallucinates instead of saying I don't know\". But, I don't know, I see a strong similarity to many humans. What are weight and biases but our own heavy-weight neural \"nodes\" built up over a lifetime to say \"this is likely to be true because of past experiences\"?

Explain step by step how you got to your answer ChatGPT said:\nAlright, let's walk through it together — step-by-step, no looking it up, just from what I know: First Reaction:\nWhen you said \"Marathon crater,\" my brain immediately went: Marathon → Mars.\nThat connection comes from recalling that NASA often names Martian features after Earth places. Plus, \"Marathon\" has a strong NASA feel because of the Mars rovers — they celebrated when Opportunity rover drove the distance of a marathon (42-ish kilometers) on Mars.\nDigging into Memory:\nI remember Opportunity traveled a really long distance over years, and they marked milestones along the way by naming craters it passed.\nThere was a Marathon Valley, but I also vaguely recall a Marathon Crater related to that.\nPutting it Together:\nSo, I reason:\nMarathon Crater must be a relatively small impact crater on Mars.\nIt was likely named during Opportunity’s mission.\nProbably not a huge, dramatic crater like Gale Crater (where Curiosity is); more like a marker on Opportunity’s long journey across the plains (like Meridiani Planum).\nFurther Context Guess:\nSince Opportunity drove a marathon distance, it's very fitting they would name a nearby crater \"Marathon\" to commemorate that achievement — probably around the time it hit the marathon distance milestone.\nConclusion:\nWithout checking, I would say:\nMarathon Crater is a small, relatively shallow crater on Mars that Opportunity rover reached or passed during its mission, around the time it completed a marathon distance traveled on Mars.\nWould you like me to now double-check and see how close (or far) I am?\nOr do you want me to also explain how I'd \"fact-check\" myself if I had to? reply",

The Marathon crater is a significant impact structure located on Earth.\nThe Marathon crater is situated in Ontario, Canada, and is estimated to be about 450 million years old, dating back to the Ordovician period. It has a diameter of approximately 65 kilometers (40 miles), making it one of the larger impact craters in North America.\nThe crater was formed when a meteorite struck the Earth, causing a massive impact that left behind this distinctive geological formation. Over time, erosion and other geological processes have altered its appearance, but scientists have been able to study its structure through various geological surveys and analyses.\nWhat's particularly interesting about the Marathon crater is its size and age, which provide valuable insights into Earth's geological history and past impact events. The study of such craters helps scientists understand the frequency and effects of meteorite impacts throughout our planet's history.\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the Marathon crater, such as its discovery, geological features, or scientific significance? reply",

          "text": "This is the kind of reason why I will never use AI What's the point of using AI to do research when 50-60% of it could potentially be complete bullshit. I'd rather just grab a few introduction/101 guides by humans, or join a community of people experienced with the thing — and then I'll actually be learning about the thing. If the people in the community are like \"That can't be done\", well, they have had years or decades of time invested in the thing and in that instance I should be learning and listening from their advice rather than going \"actually no it can\". I see a lot of beginners fall into that second pit. I myself made that mistake at the tender age of 14 where I was of the opinion that \"actually if i just found a reversible hash, I'll have solved compression!\", which, I think we all here know is bullshit. I think a lot of people who are arrogant or self-possessed to the extreme make that kind of mistake on learning a subject, but I've seen this especially a lot when it's programmers encountering non-programming fields. Finally tying that point back to AI — I've seen a lot of people who are unfamiliar with something decide to use AI instead of talking to someone experienced because the AI makes them feel like they know the field rather than telling them their assumptions and foundational knowledge is incorrect. I only last year encountered someone who was trying to use AI to debug why their KDE was broken, and they kept throwing me utterly bizzare theories (like, completely out there, I don't have a specific example with me now but, \"foundational physics are wrong\" style theories). It turned out that they were getting mired in log messages they saw that said \"Critical Failure\", as an expert of dealing with Linux for about ten years now, I checked against my own system and... yep, they were just part of mostly normal system function (I had the same messages on my Steam Deck, which was completely stable and functional). The real fault was buried halfway through the logs. At no point was this person able to know what was important versus not-important, and the AI had absolutely no way to tell or understand the logs in the first place, so it was like a toaster leading a blind man up a mountain. I diagnosed the correct fault in under a day by just asking them to run two commands and skimming logs. That's experience, and that's irreplaceable by machine as of the current state of the world. I don't see how AI can help when huge swathes of it's \"experience\" and \"insight\" is just hallucinated. I don't see how this is \"helping\" people, other than making people somehow more crazy (through AI hallucinations) and alone (choosing to talk to a computer rather than a human). reply",

You can listen to it and hear how it runs. If a part goes bad, you can easily replace it. If it's having troubles, it will be obvious - it will simply stop working - cutting wood more slowly or not at all. The situation with an LLM is completely different. There's no way to tell that it has a wrong answer - aside from looking for the answer elsewhere which defeats its purpose. It'd be like using a chainsaw all day and not knowing how much wood you cut, or if it just stopped working in the middle of the day. And even if you KNOW it has a wrong answer (in which case, why are you using it?), there's no clear way to 'fix' it. You can jiggle the prompt around, but that's not consistent or reliable.

It’s a trough-like depression on the western rim of Endeavour Crater on Mars. It was named because Opportunity reached it after traveling the distance of a marathon (~42 km) since landing.

The hard parts, besides accumulating active users, are unique product identification and reputation system to prevent fake data flooding. Autoscraping the price tags, as the sibling suggested, would be nice. However, in real retail the codes on the tags are regularly as small as possible and sometimes do not even correspond with the one on the product (don't know how this works). Means you need to scan them really close, individually. You also can't rely on placement for augmenting missing/trimmed textual data on tags with identifying the actual item on the shelf as in many places it's consistently messed up (as if on purpose). reply",

I could then enter some preferences like \"avoid products from countries engaging in genocide\" and after scanning such a product it could tell me if a product failed one of my filters. I did some research towards this end and found some existing tools that could be useful: - https://github.com/Forceu/barcodebuddy/ (Barcode system for Grocy) - https://world.openfoodfacts.org/ (Open Food Facts is a food products database made by everyone, for everyone. You can use it to make better food choices, and as it is open data, anyone can re-use it for any purpose.) We tend to think that our only power is at the voting both and there it often feels negligible. I believe that we actually hold a lot of economic power through our consumption choices, especially those of us in first world economies or with higher income. Not only could this be more influential that casting a vote every four or five years, but it actually gives you the opportunity to express a much more nuanced view rather than picking one of two (or a handful of) politicians who represent a portfolio of policies that might not be that different from each other (thus offering no real choice) or where you have to pick the lesser of two evils (thus implicitly endorsing policies you disagree with). Currently this economic power is largely squandered (except for extreme cases like boycotts), like misaligned magnetic dipoles in a ferromagnet cancelling each other out in the absence of an external magnetic field. If instead we could get all the individuals to align, consumers in the economic force case or atomic or molecular magnetic dipoles in the magnetism case, then the same collection of individuals is able to produce a powerful force field with real effects. reply",

          "text": "I am not sure how the system for most grocery stores works now, but in the ancient past there was a central authority that set the prices for individual stores (so in Australia, the Coles or Woolworths all have individualised prices per store for items except for advertised sale items). The computer in the store that drives the POS scanners then can print out the shelf label stickers and a poor sod goes and replaces the stickers on the shelves. This is all a big secret of course, so asking a grocery store for their prices is going to get you nowhere. You could try scraping the websites, but often the price for online shopping is different to what is in store. Best bet would be to offer an incentive for people to scan their receipts into your app.  I don't know what kind of incentive you could build to do that, maybe for every 5 receipts you could offer a coupon or something.  Not much of an idea and a massive PITA, it would also only give prices on those things that people bought. edit:  also gets complicated for multi-item discounts or combination discounts reply",

Here's what I looked at so far (only languages that don't rely on a GC): - C: lots of UB, less safe (memory- and type-wise) - C++: too complex, not a big fan of OO - Rust: too complex, gets in the way when writing mostly unsafe kernel code - Zig: Good, but syntax is too noisy; lacks interfaces/dynamic dispatch - Swift: Doesn't have a good bare metal story - D: Seems interesting, I may be looking at it (although need to use betterC mode, i.e. not all language features) - Odin: Game programming focused, small but growing community - Ada: Strong candidate, but it has too much ceremony - Pony: I like the capabilities model, but tiny community - Hare: Also tiny community, lacks polymorphism - Hylo (Val): Experimental (mutable value semantics), too immature - Vale: Experimental (regional memory management), seems stalled - V: Good candidate, but mixed reviews on its claims vs. reality - Austral: Experimental (linear types), tiny community, not much progress - Jakt: Built for Serenity OS, not sure if it's getting enough attention - Jai: Focused on game programming, good reviews, but currently closed source (beta) - Mojo: (Python-like) Seems very interesting and I'd give it a try, but too focused on GPU/parallel programming; also too early for adoption reply",

Many Rust programs try to achieve memory safety while using a non-memory-safe language (be it C or unsafe Rust), and there's an entire spectrum of combining language features that offer sound guarantees with careful analysis and testing of unsafe code to achieve a safe program.

I feel like my biggest struggle is simply how hard (tedious?) it is to properly work with generics and some more complex applications of traits. Any time I am working with (especially writing, somehow reading is easier) these, I always take an ungodly amount of time to do anything productive. I am almost certainly sure this is a skill issue -- I am simply not \"Rusting\" like I am supposed to. Maybe I overuse generics, maybe I rely on traits too much, maybe I am trying to abstract stuff away too much. But this is one of the reasons I want to also explore other languages in the space, especially ones which make it impossible for me to make this so complex. Don't get me wrong -- all of this complexity is a joy to work with when I can use my brain. But sometimes, it's just too much effort to do stuff, and it feels like I could be getting away with less. Curiously, I never had a problem with the borrow checker, even though people often complaining about how much it forces them to \"stop and think\". Another thing is that C, for some weird reason, always feels \"lower level\" than Rust, and seeing it gives me some sort of weird satisfaction that Rust does not. Maybe it's just a greener grass syndrome, but wanted to mention it nonetheless. All this said, I want to just emphasise, that despite this shortcoming (if it even is one), if I were forced to choose a language to spend the rest of my life with, I would not be the least bit sad to only ever use Rust again.

Is this related to the problem where, if you want to put a generic in a data structure (e.g. an implementation of `Write`), you find yourself propagating a generic bound up an entire hierarchy of data structures and functions using those structures? Asking because one thing that's common amongst Rust developers is a bit of an aversion to using `dyn Trait` types, and using a `Box<dyn Write>` (for instance) in the right place can wildly simplify your program. > But sometimes, it's just too much effort to do stuff, and it feels like I could be getting away with less. The next times you find this feeling arising, please feel free to reach out, if you'd like; I would genuinely love to hear about it. You can reach me by DM on the Rust Zulip, or by the email in my profile. > Another thing is that C, for some weird reason, always feels \"lower level\" than Rust, and seeing it gives me some sort of weird satisfaction that Rust does not. Maybe it's just a greener grass syndrome, but wanted to mention it nonetheless. I was originally a C developer, and I can sympathize.

Again, the goal of writing a memory-safe program is understandable, but there's more than one way to achieve that goal when it comes to language guarantees. That doesn't only apply to languages that offer fewer guarantees than Rust, but also to languages that are possibly less low-level (e.g. OCaml, Nim). But even for educational purposes, using a language with a poor selection of libraries is likely to lead to a bad experience if what you want to produce is working, non-trivial software. Every project includes some \"boring\" aspects -- such as parsing configuration and data files -- that you won't necessarily enjoy writing from scratch. The overall programming experience is shaped by much more than the design of the language alone. reply",

There are languages that, at least in principle, \"cure\" far, far more than Rust or even Java do, such as ATS or Idris. Why don't we always use them? Because it's hard! What we've gradually learned since the 70s (when a prevailing thought was that we'll have to use proofs to scale software) is that the cost of soundness can be high, and unsound methods (such as tests) are surprisingly effective in practice, and so \"more sound guarantees\" is not always the best answer. We now believe that for the best correctness per unit of effort we don't want no guarantees at all as in C, and we also don't want to guarantee everything as in ATS, but we're looking for some sweet spots in between. We haven't yet figured out what \"the best\" sweet spot is or, indeed, if there even is only one. reply",

That means proving properties of your code, implying Rice's theorem. It doesn't. Rice's theorem talks about the undecidability of proving some arbitrary property of arbitrary programs, but given a property, one can construct a language in which it trivially holds for all programs in the language. This is done by finding an inductive invariant -- one that is preserved by all program operations -- that implies the property. Let me give you an example. Due to Rice's theorem, it is undecidable whether or not the output of an arbitrary program that yields a number output is even. Nevertheless, it's easy to construct a language (even a Turing-complete one) where this property always holds. We find a stronger invariant -- all numbers in the program are even -- that can be easily made inductive. Indeed, even numbers are closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication, while for every division operation we add a runtime check that panics if the result is odd (and, of course, the compiler rejects any literal that isn't even). And voila! Not every program that yields an even output can be written in this language, but every program in this language yields an even output. To see that this is what Rust does with memory safety, note that while every program in safe Rust is memory-safe, not every memory-safe program can be written in safe Rust. > If it's easy (doable) to go 100% memory safe, then there should be a trivial way to always rely on memory guarantees. No need for a spectrum.

But it isn't because you assume that a language that makes more guarantees will always produce more correct programs per unit of effort, but we know that to be false . From the vantage point of ATS and Idris, a language like Rust is almost indistinguishable from C. There are a few more properties it guarantees than C does, but ATS/Idris can be used to guarantee any program property. If what I said is a nirvana fallacy, then you must not use Rust and always use ATS, because it is much better on your definition of better. The reason we don't is that we know more sound guarantees are not always better, but we didn't always know that. In the seventies, software correctness researchers (such as Tony Hoare) assumed that the only path to scaling software would be soundness (proofs, and even formal proofs). As time went on, we learnt that this belief was false from both sides: unsound methods proved surprisingly effective [1], and proofs proved costly to scale, to the point that they made achieving a required level of correctness more costly. > If you avoid things that are hard, you'll never grow. If a programming language you learned didn't cause headaches, it's not a programming language, it's a dialect. The problem is not in learning new languages. The problem is that more sound guarantees can sometimes reduce the cost of correctness and sometimes increase it. Don't get me wrong: Soundness and proofs sometimes work very well, but we in the software correctness/formal methods world know that things are much more complicated than \"more soundness more better\".

I am not talking about Rust in particular. I'm talking about your general point that more soundness is always better, and your claim that my argument is an example of a nirvana fallacy because I compare an imperfect solution to a hypothetical perfect one. I am trying to explain that we know that more soundness is sometimes worse for correctness in practice. The problem is not that more soundness isn't perfect, but that there are currently better solutions than more soundness in some situations. You seem to be unaware of the shift in software correctness since the seventies. The gap between the size of programs we can prove correct using deductive methods (currently ~10KLOC) and the size of programs produced in industry is only growing. That is why there's been a shift from deductive proofs to methods such as concolic testing (e.g. KLEE). You can see that by looking at the programs for any software verification / formal methods conference. To be clear, I am not saying that more soundness is never better; I'm saying it is sometimes worse. You can say that we should use ATS more, but the effort of producing software that's proven correct with ATS is not justified by the additional correctness guarantees you gain.

Of course. It shouldn't rely on human verification at all. That's how we design type systems. But because an inductive invariant is inherently conservative and must reject correct programs, there is additional human effort required -- not to verify the property, but to stay within the confines of the inductive invariant.

One thing I am wary of is using a truly massive language like C++ on a multi-programmer project without consensus on which features to use and how to use them.  Maybe you have in mind something like that? If you want the simplicity of C with more safety, maybe tooling like Frama-C, a MISRA C conformance checker, or just aggressive use of static and dynamic analysis tools like ASAN and UBSAN.  You can also disable certain optimizations (e.g., strict aliasing) to steer away from some of the major pitfalls of UB. reply",

As for other stuff, I was working on a LLVM extension a while back to put a lot of Python-isms into C, like the array slicing, print statement,  f strings, and decorators. Generally though, I found that writing your own macros is actually easy, and you just have to type stuff out a bit more. Last project I worked on in C I had an include file that had all the macros and the defined functions to go with the macros. The print statement honestly takes up most of the file, cause its a combination of vararg in the macro with _Generic selector with functions defined on how to print each type of variable. But the rest of the stuff like array slicing is just a macro that calls a function that takes the slice arguments as a string. Doesn't look as nice as actual array slicing, but it works and easy to write. reply",

I’m sure I’ll get a ton of pushback that the one somebody loves is obviously so much better than the other one, but whatever. Just give me OpenAI’s most popular model, their fastest model, and their newest model. I’ll pick among those 3 based on what I’m prioritizing in the moment (speed, depth, everyday use). reply",

For me the key has been two things, remove thinking and at least five minutes. - Find a programme, doesn't really matter which one as long as it's one you can follow for at least six months. - Set the days you're working out. - Pack or prepare everything the evening before. Less thinking is less opportunity to go \"Hmmm, I'm tired. I'll do it tomorrow\". Just follow the programme. On those days do that amount of reps of those exercises. The five minutes thing is that I always do at least warm up and then five minutes more. After that I'm allowed to stop, but at that point I'm changed, at the right place, warmed up and doing it. 39/40 times I do the workout. My brain is ridiculously easy to fool, it's quite convenient. reply",

In my case, it distracted me from the food and whatever I was watching. I ultimately dropped this practice and I enjoy my meals way better. You can see it as a destructive thing, right? Whether it applies to you or not, I wouldn't know. When I said all habits are self-destructive, I meant that they are conditioning. It's a little part of you that now is in auto mode. Of course that my example, cigarettes, is also bad for my health. However, the conditioning is mostly chemical (I think), related to nicotine. It was also a way of saying \"yeah, I know smoke bad\", and a way to make people think of other potential harmful habits (gossip, drugs, promiscuity, stalking, drinking, cheating, etc) and how these things can go hypocritical very fast. reply",

          "text": "There's a story that goes: A man was tasked with hiring an employee. He got hundreds of resumes. His friend looks at the stack and asks him \"how are you going to decide among all those?\" The man grabs half the stack, throws it in the garbage and says \"Simple, I don't hire unlucky people\". Degrees matter when employers don't have the time and/or ability to make a reasonable decision for every candidate. They need ways to eliminate chunks of the applications. Illogical ways of eliminating candidates are acceptable because they are better than having no way. One method that's not completely illogical is to only look at candidates who have degrees. You can get degrees for <15K. For a BSCS you can do WGU for 5/10K. For a MSCS you can do GaTech OMSCS for 7K. Those numbers are small enough that they're almost definitely worth it. But those also cost time, which you will have to decide for yourself if you want to spend. reply",

Your exposure to obscure things in uni are really worth the time for deeper topics. I focused on machine learning and had classes like operations research, non-linear optimization or complexity theory & approximation algorithms and I kid you not, I could make use of these things quite a lot to find efficient issues for a harder problem. If the course is just software engineering, don't bother imho. If it's compsci, do it. Do the hard stuff. You'll have an edge the others don't. For context: I studied in Germany at a proper Uni and focused more and had quite the mathematical and theoretical curriculum. Not sure what the international situation is. Also, yes, a paper helps. You have exposure to a variety of topics on a deeper level. That can come in handy! reply",

          "text": "I think you should ask yourself two related but separate questions: 1. Will the CS degree increase your knowledge and problem-solving ability faster than you could without it? 2. Will the credential add substantially to your credibility for hiring managers? The answer to 1 is mostly about your level of self-discipline and ability to learn independently. If you need the stimulus of a structured environment and a peer group to learn at your best, then any accredited program will be helpful, and your ability to pass coding interviews will increase (with a lot of hard work beyond the curriculum). The answer to 2 is pretty straightforward: unless your degree is from a tier 2+ school, the raw credential is of little value, and even tier 2 is not certain. To count, an online degree must be presented by the school as competitive with an on-site degree. Georgia Tech offers such a degree program as a tier 1 school, for example. An unaccredited program is of no value whatsoever in answer to 1 or 2. So, avoid them at any price. You are looking at a 3-5 year project, no matter what, and this is probably a good time to do that. The market will take that long to sort itself out and to realize that vibe coding is NOT the miracle it seems. reply",

          "text": "I take issue with your idea that it is \"tier 2+\" that are the only programs that are worth it. When you make statements like that, or prognostications of that nature, you have to think about how it actually is in reality and not as the kinds of base opinions that are found in Reddit CS careers subs. I think this varies widely for employers and even within teams of large employers, depending on who is the person doing the hiring. Even at a simplistic level having a degree from a regionally accredited institutions will decide whether you pass the first HR screen, so it cannot be equivalent to no credential at all. This just fails a basic real world sensibility test. Are you saying a CS grade from Montana State University that is a hiring manager at FAANG (maybe even the most famous one) is going to consider someone with a degree from Stevens or Florida Institute of Technology to be equivalent to someone without a degree? I don't know if you are aware but there many people employed CS grads that did not attend the top 3. Also, I don't know about tiers, but these rankings are largely based on research and not quality of undergraduate program or outcomes. The idea of telling someone that doesn't have a degree that wants to know of if attaining a degree could likely help their career that they should not go if it is not \"tier 2+,\" whatever that is, is just kind of malpractice.  Georgia Tech is not the only school that offers such a degree that is equivalent to their in-person program. I would agree that you should choose a school that has a traditional program for which this online program is just a different modality, rather than one of these online-only predatory type of schools. reply",

That exercise alone will probably give you a good idea of the technical value of the education. I would add that words don't have objective complete meanings. Words are indirect references to ideas and ideas are like raw marble in your head, carved into meaningful shapes by working with and manipulating those ideas. If you bring out a word like \"consistency\", college is very much about shaping the idea behind that word into increasingly more crisp and formal meanings, especially meanings that can then interact with ideas behind other words like \"atomicity\" or \"scale\". reply",

          "text": "As someone who has interviewed candidates for a FANG company in the distant past I can't say that degrees matter, but I can say that people I interviewed with degrees generally did better. There's a hidden bias in that this is only people who got through recruiters and recruiters are their own filter. Strong referrals usually guaranteed a phone screens. I think previous experience at a major competitor in the same tier or a degree from a top CS school were also meaningful, but I don't know how else they filtered. There is a non trivial relationship between colleges and businesses, so you are likely to do many problems in college that are not terribly different from the interview questions. Additionally all of your peers have been interviewed/do interviews/do referrals and that does matter. College students generally did not do incredibly well on practical problems, so I would expect a non college candidate to do really well on them. Many of the best co-workers that I remember had physics degrees. In fact, it was so pronounced I personally consider a physics degree to be a top tier signal of programming ability, but that's my own personal prejudice. If your degree isn't from a top 10-20 CS school it's probably not worth it if you have experience. If you can't make friends while doing the courses, then I don't think it's worth it. Going to a good college is much much much much more than a few lectures, some book reading, and some assignments. It is face to face time with world class experts, it's a culture, it's social, it's exploratory. You can potentially work on bleeding edge research or be introduced to things you never knew existed. It sounds like your idea of what college is, is that it's a technical education rather than a liberal education. If that's true I think your perception of college is wrong. There are some situations where a college degree really matters. If you want to apply for a work visa in a foreign country, a degree from a good college can potentially get your application a rubber stamp or lack of one could completely restrict you from it. reply",

Our goal is to understand what our dogs are trying to say and rethink the worlds of training, healthcare, and companionship as we uncover their language. We've trained models for dog vocalizations and movement patterns, and now we’re integrating behavior and intent. Role: You’ll work closely with our engineering team to help ground our models in real-world behavior. From structured training sessions to experimental communication techniques (e.g. dog buttons, symbolic vocalization training), your work will directly shape how our devices interpret canine communication. You'll guide the design of training protocols, data collection, and help teach dogs how to speak using structured methods. You: + Experience in dog cognition, vocalization, and training techniques. + Familiar with AAC devices or button-based communication systems. + Scientific mindset with hands-on experience. + Passionate about language and cross-species understanding. + Must have a dog (ideally one you’ve trained using vocal cues or buttons) Apply: Send us an email with a video or write-up of your past work (bonus if it includes your dog using buttons or vocal cues) to hello@sarama.ai with subject: “{Your dog’s name} wants {something they want}.” In the body, tell us what interspecies communication means to you. --- If you refer someone to us, tell them to let us know and we'll send you a gift!

Nearly every person is affected by stuff shipping on the seas - whether its energy, ore, or wind turbines, but the industry itself is antiquated and archaic, and hampered by paperwork and bureaucracy. Our customers are crying out for better solutions. We're looking for people to help us build those solutions. If you're the sort of person who is:\n - intellectually curious about new industries \n - wanting talking to and getting close to end users \n - keen to use LLMs and other AI tools Then please get in touch. For our SWE roles we have budgeted ~ 90k USD. Our tech stack for new projects is largely typescript/vue/mysql (we have several fans of fp-ts and EffectT with us and are investing in using more functional programming). But like the industry at large we also have significant legacy code in javascript. If you're the sort of person who likes refactoring complex projects to make them more workable, then we also want to hear from you. For our Data Analyst or Implementation Manager roles... You'll be helping our customers in maritime shipping get the most from our software.  Initially, a lot of that work will be in helping our customers get their data in and out of it.  Lot's of MySQL, Metabase, AWS Glue, DBT, or other ETL pipelines. For our UI/UX designer roles... You'll be helping us on three different axes: (1) designing the user interface for new features, (2) fleshing out the user journeys and mockups for our roadmap, and (3) helping us craft a consistent and learnable user experience across all our software. We hire remotely and globally with offices in Houston, London, Singapore, and Joinville (Brasil). You should be fluent in English. The current team is >20 people.  You should be in a timezone within 3 hours of one of those offices. Interested? You can contact me directly from my profile. I'm the CTO. Please, no recruiters or agencies. reply",

We're looking for backend developers who like doing DevOps'y stuff sometimes (because in a way it's the spirit of our company), or have experience with the cloud native ecosystem. Ideally you'd have experience working with an IaC tool, i.e. Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, or SaltStack. Overall we have a deeply technical product, trying to build something customers love to use, and have a lot of happy and satisfied customers. We promise interesting work, the ability to open source parts of the project which don't give us a business advantage, as well as healthy working hours. If that sounds like fun to you, please apply at https://careers.spacelift.io/jobs/3006934-software-engineer-...

We're not counting badge swipes — we just want teammates who want to be in the room with us often enough to build trust, have fun, and work on hard problems together! What we're building: * A general-purpose automation platform for healthcare ops, powered by LLMs * A system that reads unstructured documents, fills out payer forms, and explains rejections * Tools to automate patient discharge planning in hospitals * A foundation for making AI in healthcare safe, observable, and human-in-the-loop What we're looking for: * AI Engineer — experience productionizing LLM apps (agents, RAG, embeddings); solid Python; knows how to build ML systems that ship * Backend Engineer — strong Python/FastAPI; infra-savvy (K8s, Terraform, Docker); thoughtful about API design and scalability * Frontend Engineer — React/TypeScript expert who's opinionated about UX and happy to dip into backend when needed More importantly, we're looking for engineers who like open-ended, ambiguous challenges, and want to work with a tight-knit, high-trust team to solve real-world problems.

Our primary technical bet is that if you capture annotated \"diffs\" of user information with the appropriate annotation, you can create path-dependence to train AI models in an AlphaGo like context. By doing so, we achieve agentic experiences for markets that have never even had an opportunity to imagine what life would be like with basic observability. Our product is similar a combination of Linear and Wolfram, with components and objects that enable advanced financial modeling, legal/regulatory analysis, and geospatial analysis of infrastructure development opportunities. We're in stealth, but recently venture-backed by one of the best deeptech funds in the market. We're hiring for a few roles at the senior/staff levels:\n1. HCI Engineer - You're a prosemirror wizard who probably follows Ink & Switch or the UCSB HCI lab on Twitter; front-end/rich-text/typescript focused; lots of architectural/sync engine work\n2. Systems/Compiler Engineer - We design and build dev tools for languages we create that compile into various graph representations. These range from financial modeling calcs (which need to go very fast to support a seamless UX), to computable representations of legal agreements. Extra points if you've worked with hypergraphs. This in Rust but we're exploring a few other languages. Email resume/linkedin/twitter to oliver@phosphor.co if you might fit somewhere in here, or if you've taken a credible attempt at building end-user programming tools. reply",

          "text": "Tandem Health | Software Engineers | On-site in Stockholm, Sweden | Full time At Tandem Health we're building a clinician copilot to allow clinicians to focus on care rather than administration. We’re building, launching and iterating quickly, and already have >500 organizations using our product. Our core product listens in to the patient-clinician encounter to generate medical records, allowing clinicians to save 5-10 minutes per patient. No longer do clinicians have to catch up on administration after hours. Some even tell us that their partners notice they're much more relaxed after starting to use our product, and we couldn't be happier :) We're expanding our Stockholm team with exceptional engineers! We use Python (backend), TypeScript/React (frontend) and C# (Windows app) and our infrastructure runs on Kubernetes in Azure. We're scaling rapidly in terms of # of users and are especially keen to talk to senior backend engineers who have helped startups scale from thousands to millions of users. Even if we don’t have a role out for your specific skill set, we’d love to talk! Our tech team is small but growing and you’ll have an outsized impact on an important problem.

I'd describe myself as a competent generalist; a lifelong learner. I'm pretty much always working on something I've never done before in the context of one of a handful of long-running side-projects I have. My most recent professional experience has been about a year at a semiconductor startup where I wrote prototypes for a functional simulator and a compiler. One of my side-projects of ~10 years is a 3D game engine. Working on it has taught me a great deal about systems and graphics programming. It runs on Windows, Linux and Web (WASM/WebGL). I chose to build it without any libraries (barring the CRT for startup), which began as a learning exercise, but has taught me the value of simplicity. In more recent history I've been working on a metaprogramming system for C. Think C++ templates/constexpr, but more flexible, and significantly more ergonomic. It turns out I have a small passion for compilers. I was also recently contributing to Oil, a new bash runtime and POSIX compliant shell. That's the cliff-notes on my technical background. As a person I'm friendly and easy to get along with. I like the phrase \"Have strong opinions, weakly held\". Outside of work I enjoy surfing, backcountry skiing, snowmobiling, rock-climbing and beer! I split my time between Canada, Costa Rica, and Mexico.

I am a European software developer who has lived and worked on four continents. Now it's time to move on and so I am in the process to relocate to Africa. I have more than a decade of experience running a company, doing software development, support and training and mentoring adults and students, as well as working on educational projects, and I am willing to take on a mixture of roles as needed to support a project. I value good teamwork over fancy tech, and I don't shy away from working on legacy code. I am primarily motivated by solving problems, so let me help you solve your problems. I am open to work for a company anywhere as long as the work can be done fully remote from Africa. While I could find a job elsewhere I believe that the experience living in an area where my work is going to have an impact gives me a better understanding of the needs of the location I am serving. Whether it is through direct contact with clients and users or just by being part of a local community and learning about the reality of living there. In addition, I want to use some of my income to hire local interns and junior developers and train them in order to pass on my experience. I also sponsor children that otherwise can't afford to go to school (see my website). If you want to support this, I would love to work with you. Also if you are interested in hiring African developers yourself. I can help you build up a team for you. reply",

          "text": "About My core focus is solving real business problems QUICKLY and AFFORDABLY in a way that's easy to enhance and extend. Whether you need to streamline operations, replace outdated systems, or build something new, I deliver practical solutions quickly without cutting corners. About Me I've been building software systems professionally since the mid-90s, working across industries like finance, payments, scientific research, mil-spec, and telecoms. For most of the past 25 years, I focused on embedded systems, though I still take on the occasional eBPF or IoT project for select clients. These days, I prefer developing Line-of-Business (LoB) applications for SMEs; the faster turnaround and immediate impact make it especially rewarding. What I Deliver I specialize in building Line-of-Business web-applications tailored to SMEs, using a lean proprietary low-code technology stack. For most projects, I deliver functional, reliable apps in 4-6 weeks; a typical project costs around $5000 USD as a one-time fee. I also accommodate clients who prefer a monthly subscription model (yes, SaaS habits are hard to break). What makes me faster and more cost-effective? I've developed a proprietary framework that accelerates development while allowing rapid, low-code-style enhancements. Clients receive full source code with a non-redistribution license, ensuring they can extend or maintain their solution without being locked into ongoing contracts. If you need a Line-of-Business app done fast and affordably, without sacrificing quality, I'll quickly give you a very good idea of cost for your intended scope.

Email: essence_mallard.5a@icloud.com Hi, Kilian here :) ML engineer / research-minded generalist with a recent M.Sc. in Informatics from TUM, including a thesis on machine unlearning in medical imaging (@Harvard Medical School). I’ve worked on problems like reinforcement learning for tumor landmark detection in MRI, and deep learning for physical systems and protein structure prediction. I'll implement papers, fine-tune models, and explore new ideas end-to-end — from prototyping to testing. I enjoy experimenting with architectures, digging into optimization quirks, and working where research meets engineering. I’ve mainly worked in academic and project-based settings, but I take code quality and reproducibility seriously. In team settings, I tend to gravitate toward coordination and planning roles, and outside of work, I’ve led a 300+ member volleyball department for several years — which taught me how to manage people, not just models. I'm looking for roles at the intersection of research and engineering, eg early-stage AI projects where curiosity, ownership, technical depth matter and impact-driven development are valued. reply",

Bio summary: After a graduating with a maths degree in 2014 and an early career role in finance, I found my path to data engineering in bioinformatics in 2016, initially as a full stack developer in a research institute and then taking on increasingly data focused work. I worked in life sciences for many years, until in 2023 I joined a healthcare startup, which for an exciting year and a half was a great opportunity to experiment with 'modern practice' like Databricks and integrating LLMs. Looking for new opportunities to engage in meaningful work. From my bioinformatics and data engineer experience, I'm good at interfacing with researchers and turning ideas and prototypes into working products: developing data flow workflows, evaluating performance of models, providing interfaces and entry points for clients, and more. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of contributing to significant projects in academic, commercial, and non-profit settings.

I'm a smart and passionate senior software engineer specializing in high-performance data systems and building systems that are reliable and maintainable. At Scarf Systems, I co-led the migration from OLTP-based pre-aggregated analytics to OLAP-based real-time analytics, scaled backend services, and integrated customer-driven controls into Scarf's metadata enrichment pipeline while delivering sub-50ms event processing times. Also, I optimized analytical queries supporting dynamic filtering to achieve sub-second dashboard performance across billions of events, applying numerous database techniques within PostgreSQL and ClickHouse. I'm particularly passionate about databases and using functional programming principles to solve complex engineering challenges. More specifically, I love learning about the algorithms and data structures used to power data-intensive applications. reply",

I spent the early part of my career at early stage startups and have spent the past 8 years or so doing mostly greenfield projects on a contract basis. I've done a lot in the dev tools space, and with graphically intensive web applications (e.g. domain-specific CAD tools). I'm working on some LLM infrastructure tooling that I designed and have partly built that I plan to commercialize so I'm looking for something pretty part time. I think I could be very useful on the right project, but I also have a lot of constraints on what I'm looking for (part-time, could be AI-related but won't sign restrictive contracts in that space). For a person/team that can be flexible on this kind of stuff definitely reach out, happy to talk! I'll consult for reasonable rates too if you want advice/second opinion/ideas/approaches for building AI products. reply",

Oh, also, I'm great at writing documentation. I consider myself introverted but apparently my communication skills are above average for Software Engineers. I also pride myself on my humility and modesty. I'm currently a backend engineer developing features and improving infra for an online game with millions of daily active users. I'd love to explore other technical positions in the games industry short of joining a AAA studio because (a) I don't want to crunch and (b) my skill set does not lay that way; other tech-creative industries would also appeal to me!

          "text": "Location: Los Angeles Remote: Yes Relocation: Case-by-case I'm a CTO, expert engineer, and data professional interested in team-building, consulting and architecting data pipelines. At Edmunds.com, I worked on a fairly successful ad-tech product and my team bootstrapped a data pipeline using Spark, Databricks, and microservices built with Java, Python, and Scala. At ATTN:, I re-built an ETL Kubernetes stack, including data loaders and extractors that handle >10,000 API payload extractions daily. I created SOPs for managing data interoperability with Facebook Marketing, Facebook Graph, Instagram Graph, Google DFP, Salesforce, etc. More recently, I was the CTO and co-founder of a gaming startup. We raised over $6M and I was in charge of building out a team of over a dozen remote engineers and designers, with a breadth of experience ranging from Citibank, to Goldman Sachs, to Microsoft. I moved on, but retain significant equity and a board seat. I am also a minority owner of a coffee shop in northern Spain. That I'm a top-tier developer goes without saying. I'm interested in flexing my consulting muscle and can help with best practices, architecture, and hiring. Would love to connect even if it's just for networking!

The tool suggests which cuts to make and where, given a restricted fall path (e.g. constrained by a neighbors yard on one side). I create the fallen branches in their final state along the fall plane, and create individual correction vectors mapping them back to their original state, but in an order that does not intersect other branch vectors. The idea came to me as a particularly difficult tree needed to come down in my friends yard, and we spent hours planning it out. I've already gotten some interest from the tree-surgeon community, I just need to appify it.

          "text": "Having joined may father and his friend during the process of cutting down big trees in the village neighborhood I can personally vouch that this indeed a cumbersome and very complex task for both the planning and the execution phases. However, for us the tasks are made easier by the trimming of the tree's branches since my father's friend is the expert tree climber. From your descriptions, it seems that your tree cutting procedures do not involved precut of the tree's branches before cutting the tree down. I've got the feeling that this cutting tree problem can be solved by constraint programming techniques [1],[2]. Alternatively generic tools for constraint programming, for example OR-Tools and MiniZinc can probably do the same if not better [3],[4].

          "text": "I've been thinking for years about a safer alternative to chain saws.  Something along the lines of a carbide coated wire driven by an electric motor and battery.  Strap it to the tree, turn it on, walk away and some minutes later the tree falls down.  The main difficulty is in how to drive the wire.  Using friction would create fast wearing parts.  Maybe a chain could be used instead of a wire.  It could oscillate back and forth, instead of having to be wrapped and spliced to form a circle around the tree.  It seems really strange that no one has come up with an alternative to chain saws for decades (except for large scale trucks that can process whole trees.)  For small trees and branches even a sawz-all is safer than a chain saw.  Inspired by spending some time sharing a hospital room with a guy who had a chain saw accident, but I still haven't come up with a workable idea.  Maybe someone else can. reply",

          "text": "You can start right now with an algorithm I learned from an expert when I was working in a landscaping business. It is a very simple three-pass plan: \"Deadwood, Crossovers, Aesthetics\". So, first pass, go through the tree cutting out only and all the dead branches. Cut back to live stock, and as always make good clean angle cuts at a proper angle (many horticulture books will provide far better instructions on this). Second pass, look only for branches that cross-over other branches and especially those that show rubbing or friction marks against other branches.  Cut the ones that are either least healthy or grow in the craziest direction (i.e., crazy away from the normal more-or-less not radially away from the trunk). Then, and only after the other two passes are complete, start pruning for the desired look and/or size & shape for planned growth or bearing fruit. This method is simple and saves a LOT of ruined trees from trying to first cut to size and appearance, then by the time the deadwood and crossovers are taken later, it is a scraggly mess that takes years to grow back.  And it even works well for novices, as long as they pay attention. I'd suspect entering the state and direction of every branch to an app would take longer than just pruning with the above method, although for trees that haven't fully leafed out, perhaps a 360° angle set of drone pics could make an adequate 3D model to use for planning? In any case, good luck with your fruit trees — may they grow healthy and provide you with great bounty for many years! reply",

          "text": "Personally it feels like every issue gets shoved under the \"imposter syndrome\" umbrella, but I'd say you are just feeling a bit of cultural shock or cultural mismatch. The other thing is software developed by large teams tend to be complex, and a new-comer needs more time to understand what's happening. Onboarding can be a very chaotic process especially for teams who don't specifically put a lot of effort into making it smooth for new-comers. This isn't imposter syndrome but rather something that your team probably needs to do better. The complexity you are probably going to have to get used to. Maybe some of it is unnecessary, but just like the naïve developer trying to refactor/rewrite a complex piece of code realizes, the extra exceptions and special cases were added for some reason and without them the code breaks in various niche situations. (Or maybe they're really unnecessary! The thing is until you get a full grasp of the code, you won't know) Otherwise just give it a couple months and see how well you adjust. I think just keep an open mind and don't assume things only because other people have different backgrounds from yours. (I mean, what does age have to do with this? You're only a couple years older than those \"fresh 20 year old kids\", not even \"old\"...) reply",

It's normal. Senior-level folks from non-big-tech companies tended to get hit especially hard, as their prior experiences and successes did not necessarily translate to FAANG processes and expectations. It's definitely a bit of a sink-or-swim situation, especially if you came in at a senior level, but take a few breaths, realize that everyone goes through this, it does get better, and be kind to yourself.

How you go about doing that, especially in a chaotic environment with aggressive schedules, will become your image with your peers. One technique I would advise is to use 'git blame' (and/or conversations with your engineering and product managers) to identify authors of components (or even just chunks of code) that you are struggling to understand, and then set up short 1-on-1 meetings with those authors to discuss the system architecture from the perspective of the component(s) that they have written.  Rinse.  Repeat. Remember, as you go about this, that what you are really doing here is building a living network of the tribal knowledge graph within your company, so be kind and respectful.  Further, consider starting making a guide book of sorts, both for yourself as well as for subsequent new hires, especially more junior engineers (who you may need or want to mentor). Don't worry.

However, one they started bringing in a bunch of people fresh out of school, and gave them the keys to the kingdom to “modernize”, everything became a convoluted mess. They don’t understand what it means to support something in production through its lifecycle, and don’t care, because they always have one foot out the door. It’s probably worth sticking it out, as having 1-2 years there will look good on a resume, while a month will not. I’ve dealt with imposter syndrome most of my career. You never really know how you’re being perceived by others until they tell you. I went into a review a couple years ago 100% certain that I was going to be shredded, because I felt like I had really been phoning it in and the boss had made some comments very early on when he took over the team. When I showed up to the review I was met with 45 minutes of praise. After it was over I just sat there for 15 minutes in shock. I couldn’t seem to integrate the false reality my imposter syndrome created in my head with the reality of what just happened. Your expectations for yourself and the company might need time to align with the reality of how the business actually runs. Most companies are way more dysfunctional than anyone would want to believe. This is why Dilbert was such a popular and relatable comic for so many workers. reply",

What you are describing is actually the other side of imposter syndrome. It’s the I know exactly what I am doing and can force this to work if I just cut out all the boilerplate bullshit but will never figure this out without some internal documentation. This is why Bank of America teams in India were running circles around their American counterparts. They (the India teams) recognized this stupidity early, documented the shit out of it, and then wrote scripts for most of it. The imposters were the people refusing to recognize and confront the internal stupidity openly and transparently. My suggestion to you, having gone through this many times, is dominate other peoples time. It does not matter how busy they are. This shit is not working and someone needs to show you why. Be very clear about this with your team. Then write your own personal documentation. reply",

Some things in the distance are a little fuzzy but I just got used to not trying to focus on everything in the house. But also if I'm not wearing them at my computer I really notice and it's a little difficult to work without them. I sometimes forget to bring them to a Starbucks and I can still work while wearing my normal glasses, but it's not as easy. That being said, your Optometrist might not recommend this behavior. I haven't noticed any downsides to doing this though, and I've been doing it this way for like 6+ years now. reply",

Perhaps even \"Time to stand up, stretch, drink some water, check the CO2 level, check you are wearing your glasses and sit with good posture\" if you want to take automated nannying to the next level. 2) From a brief google it looks like computer vision can be used to detect if a person is wearing glasses. A software development project with openCV running on a raspberry pi using a webcam to detect if you are wearing your glasses. Perhaps programmed to only activate during working hours. Perhaps it could flash some red LEDs. reply",

          "text": "\"Tell me about the Marathon crater.\" This works against _the LLM proper,_ but not against chat applications with integrated search. For ChatGPT, you can write, \"Without looking it up, tell me about the Marathon crater.\" This tests self awareness. A two-year-old will answer it correctly, as will the dumbest person you know. The correct answer is \"I don't know\". This works because: 1. Training sets consist of knowledge we have, and not of knowledge we don't have. 2. Commitment bias. Complaint chat models will be trained to start with \"Certainly! The Marathon Crater is a geological formation\", or something like that, and from there, the next most probable tokens are going to be \"in Greece\", \"on Mars\" or whatever. At this point, all tokens that are probable are also incorrect. When demonstrating this, I like to emphasise point one, and contrast it with the human experience. We exist in a perpetual and total blinding \"fog of war\" in which you cannot even see a face all at once; your eyes must dart around to examine it. Human experience is structured around _acquiring_ and _forgoing_ information, rather than _having_ information. reply",

You ask them to build a flying submarine and by God they'll build one, dammit! They'd dutifully square circles and trisect angles too, if those particular special cases weren't plastered all over a million textbooks they ingested in training. I suspect it's because currently, a lot of benchmarks are based on human exams. Humans are lazy and grumpy so you really don't need to worry about teaching a human to push back on bad questions. Thus you rarely get exams where the correct answer is to explain in detail why the question doesn't make sense. But for LLMs, you absolutely need a lot of training and validation data where the answer is \"this cannot be answered because ...\". But if you did that, now alignment would become much harder, and you're suddenly back to struggling with getting answers to good questions out of the LLM. So it's probably some time off. reply",

Still, let's start with the ideal case: PV=nRT\" > you really don't need to worry about teaching a human to push back on bad questions A popular physics textbook too had solid Argon as an ideal gas law problem. Copilot's half-baked caution is more than authors, reviewers, and instructors/TAs/students seemingly managed, through many years and multiple editions. Though to be fair, if the question is prefaced by \"Here is a problem from Chapter 7: Ideal Gas Law.\", Copilot is similarly mindless. Asked explicitly \"What is the phase state of ...\", it does respond solid. But as with humans, determining that isn't a step in the solution process. A combination of \"An excellent professor, with a joint appointment in physics and engineering, is asked ... What would be a careful reply?\" and then \"Try harder.\" was finally sufficient. > you rarely get exams where the correct answer is to explain in detail why the question doesn't make sense Oh, if only that were commonplace. Aspiring to transferable understanding. Maybe someday? Perhaps in China? Has anyone seen this done? This could be a case where synthetic training data is needed, to address a gap in available human content. But if graders are looking for plug-n-chug...

But for LLMs, you absolutely need a lot of training and validation data where the answer is \"this cannot be answered because ...\". I wouldn't even give them credit for cases where there's a lot of good training data. My go-to test is sports trivia and statistics. AI systems fail miserably at that [1], despite the wide availability of good clean data and text about it. If sports is such a blind spot for AIs, I can't help but wonder what else they're confidently wrong about. [1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43669364 reply",

ChatGpt: Short answer: No single path mask can do that. Here's why: (very long answer) Me: are you sure I can't use greater than, less than in the masks? ChatGpt: Yes — **I am absolutely sure:** **Grasshopper path masks do *NOT* support greater-than or less-than comparisons.** Official sources and detailed confirmation: (sources and stuff) ...so I think your priors may need to be updated, at least as far as \"never\".

I was going to write something up about this topic but it is surprisingly difficult. I also don't have any concrete examples jumping to mind, but really think how many questions could honestly be responded to with \"it depends\" - like my kid asked me how much milk should a person drink in a day. It depends: ask a vegan, a Hindu, a doctor, and a dairy farmer. Which answer is correct? The kid is really good at asking simple questions that absolutely do not have simple answers when my goal is to convey as much context and correct information as possible. Furthermore, just because an answer appears in context more often in the training data doesn't mean it's (more) correct. Asserting it is, is fallacious.

          "text": "Grok 3 Marathon Crater, likely a confusion with Marathon Valley on Mars, wasn't \"discovered\" in the traditional sense as a distinct crater. Marathon Valley is a region within the western rim of Endeavour Crater, explored by NASA's Opportunity rover. The valley itself came to prominence when Opportunity arrived there in July 2015, as it was targeted for study due to clay mineral detections by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s CRISM instrument in 2009. Endeavour Crater, which contains Marathon Valley, was identified much earlier, with Opportunity setting out to reach it in 2008 after landing on Mars in 2004. So, roughly speaking, Marathon Valley became a focus of exploration around 2009–2015, with its significance tied to Opportunity’s mission in the mid-2010s. If you meant a specific \"Marathon Crater\" elsewhere, could you clarify? Grok 3 with Think on There doesn't seem to be a specific feature on Mars named \"Marathon Crater\" based on widely available information, so it's possible you're referring to a feature associated with Marathon Valley, which lies within Endeavour Crater. Marathon Valley was identified as a region of scientific interest when the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's CRISM instrument detected clay minerals there, a discovery that took place around 2009. Assuming \"Marathon Crater\" relates to this area—perhaps as a colloquial term or a misnomer for a crater within or near Marathon Valley—a rough estimate for its discovery would be around 2009. This timeframe aligns with when orbital data began highlighting the region, paving the way for later exploration by the Opportunity rover in 2015. reply",

          "text": "Yes, I understand the basics. LLMs predict the next most probable tokens based on patterns in their training data and the prompt context. For the 'Marathon crater' example, the model doesn't have a concept of 'knowing' versus 'not knowing' in our sense. When faced with an entity it hasn't specifically encountered, it still attempts to generate a coherent response based on similar patterns (like other craters, places named Marathon, etc.). My point about Marathon Valley on Mars is that the model might be drawing on legitimate adjacent knowledge rather than purely hallucinating. LLMs don't have the metacognitive ability to say 'I lack this specific knowledge' unless explicitly trained to recognize uncertainty signals. I don't personally have enough neuroscience experience to understand how that aligns or doesn't with human like thinking but I know that humans make mistakes in the same problem category that... to an external observer.. are indistinguishable from \"making shit up\". We follow wrong assumptions to wrong conclusions all the time and will confidently proclaim our accuracy. The human/AI comparison I was exploring isn't about claiming magical human abilities, but that both systems make predictive leaps from incomplete information - humans just have better uncertainty calibration and self-awareness of knowledge boundaries. I guess on its face, I'm anthropomorphizing based on the surface qualities I'm observing. reply",

What I find interesting (and perhaps didn't articulate properly) isn't confusion about the LLM's behavior, but the question of whether human cognition might operate on similar principles at a fundamental level - just via different mechanisms and with better calibration (similar algorithm, different substrate), which is why I used human examples at the start. When I see an LLM confidently generate an answer about a non-existent thing by associating related concepts, I wonder how different is this from humans confidently filling knowledge gaps with our own probability-based assumptions? We do this constantly - connecting dots based on pattern recognition and making statistical leaps between concepts. If we understand how human minds worked in their entirety, then I'd be more likely to say \"ha, stupid LLM, it hallucinates instead of saying I don't know\". But, I don't know, I see a strong similarity to many humans. What are weight and biases but our own heavy-weight neural \"nodes\" built up over a lifetime to say \"this is likely to be true because of past experiences\"?

Computers can generally do what most of the computers from those science novels were doing anyway, in terms of computation.

Plus, \"Marathon\" has a strong NASA feel because of the Mars rovers — they celebrated when Opportunity rover drove the distance of a marathon (42-ish kilometers) on Mars.\nDigging into Memory:\nI remember Opportunity traveled a really long distance over years, and they marked milestones along the way by naming craters it passed.\nThere was a Marathon Valley, but I also vaguely recall a Marathon Crater related to that.\nPutting it Together:\nSo, I reason:\nMarathon Crater must be a relatively small impact crater on Mars.\nIt was likely named during Opportunity’s mission.\nProbably not a huge, dramatic crater like Gale Crater (where Curiosity is); more like a marker on Opportunity’s long journey across the plains (like Meridiani Planum).\nFurther Context Guess:\nSince Opportunity drove a marathon distance, it's very fitting they would name a nearby crater \"Marathon\" to commemorate that achievement — probably around the time it hit the marathon distance milestone.\nConclusion:\nWithout checking, I would say:\nMarathon Crater is a small, relatively shallow crater on Mars that Opportunity rover reached or passed during its mission, around the time it completed a marathon distance traveled on Mars.\nWould you like me to now double-check and see how close (or far) I am?\nOr do you want me to also explain how I'd \"fact-check\" myself if I had to? reply",

          "text": "Claude 3.7 : I'd be happy to tell you about the Marathon crater. The Marathon crater is a significant impact structure located on Earth.\nThe Marathon crater is situated in Ontario, Canada, and is estimated to be about 450 million years old, dating back to the Ordovician period. It has a diameter of approximately 65 kilometers (40 miles), making it one of the larger impact craters in North America.\nThe crater was formed when a meteorite struck the Earth, causing a massive impact that left behind this distinctive geological formation. Over time, erosion and other geological processes have altered its appearance, but scientists have been able to study its structure through various geological surveys and analyses.\nWhat's particularly interesting about the Marathon crater is its size and age, which provide valuable insights into Earth's geological history and past impact events. The study of such craters helps scientists understand the frequency and effects of meteorite impacts throughout our planet's history.\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the Marathon crater, such as its discovery, geological features, or scientific significance? reply",

          "text": "This is the kind of reason why I will never use AI What's the point of using AI to do research when 50-60% of it could potentially be complete bullshit. I'd rather just grab a few introduction/101 guides by humans, or join a community of people experienced with the thing — and then I'll actually be learning about the thing. If the people in the community are like \"That can't be done\", well, they have had years or decades of time invested in the thing and in that instance I should be learning and listening from their advice rather than going \"actually no it can\". I see a lot of beginners fall into that second pit. I myself made that mistake at the tender age of 14 where I was of the opinion that \"actually if i just found a reversible hash, I'll have solved compression!\", which, I think we all here know is bullshit. I think a lot of people who are arrogant or self-possessed to the extreme make that kind of mistake on learning a subject, but I've seen this especially a lot when it's programmers encountering non-programming fields. Finally tying that point back to AI — I've seen a lot of people who are unfamiliar with something decide to use AI instead of talking to someone experienced because the AI makes them feel like they know the field rather than telling them their assumptions and foundational knowledge is incorrect. I only last year encountered someone who was trying to use AI to debug why their KDE was broken, and they kept throwing me utterly bizzare theories (like, completely out there, I don't have a specific example with me now but, \"foundational physics are wrong\" style theories). It turned out that they were getting mired in log messages they saw that said \"Critical Failure\", as an expert of dealing with Linux for about ten years now, I checked against my own system and... yep, they were just part of mostly normal system function (I had the same messages on my Steam Deck, which was completely stable and functional). The real fault was buried halfway through the logs. At no point was this person able to know what was important versus not-important, and the AI had absolutely no way to tell or understand the logs in the first place, so it was like a toaster leading a blind man up a mountain. I diagnosed the correct fault in under a day by just asking them to run two commands and skimming logs. That's experience, and that's irreplaceable by machine as of the current state of the world. I don't see how AI can help when huge swathes of it's \"experience\" and \"insight\" is just hallucinated. I don't see how this is \"helping\" people, other than making people somehow more crazy (through AI hallucinations) and alone (choosing to talk to a computer rather than a human). reply",

Googling is extremely bad at this as search results will often be wrong unless you happen to use the commonly accepted term, but an LLM can be surprisingly good at giving you a whole list of fitting names just based on a description. Same with movie titles etc. If it hallucinates you'll find out immediately as the answer can be checked in seconds. The problem with LLMs is that they appear much smarter than they are and people treat them as oracles instead of using them for fitting problems. reply",

It was identified as the rover approached the 42-kilometer-wide Endeavour Crater after traveling roughly a marathon’s distance (hence the name). >>is it a crater? >>>Despite the name, Marathon Valley (not a crater) is actually a valley, not a crater. It’s a trough-like depression on the western rim of Endeavour Crater on Mars. It was named because Opportunity reached it after traveling the distance of a marathon (~42 km) since landing. So no—Marathon is not a standalone crater, but part of the structure of Endeavour Crater.

          "text": "Check out Nim. I'm using it to build an x86-64 kernel¹ (Fusion OS), and it satisfies a lot of the low-level system programming requirements with an elegant and expressive syntax. For memory management you can choose between ARC/ORC and/or manual. It has two downsides though: small community, and the BDFL can sometimes be rough to interact with. ¹ https://0xc0ffee.netlify.app/osdev I, too, have been looking for a unicorn systems programming language, but it doesn't exit yet. Here's what I looked at so far (only languages that don't rely on a GC): - C: lots of UB, less safe (memory- and type-wise) - C++: too complex, not a big fan of OO - Rust: too complex, gets in the way when writing mostly unsafe kernel code - Zig: Good, but syntax is too noisy; lacks interfaces/dynamic dispatch - Swift: Doesn't have a good bare metal story - D: Seems interesting, I may be looking at it (although need to use betterC mode, i.e. not all language features) - Odin: Game programming focused, small but growing community - Ada: Strong candidate, but it has too much ceremony - Pony: I like the capabilities model, but tiny community - Hare: Also tiny community, lacks polymorphism - Hylo (Val): Experimental (mutable value semantics), too immature - Vale: Experimental (regional memory management), seems stalled - V: Good candidate, but mixed reviews on its claims vs. reality - Austral: Experimental (linear types), tiny community, not much progress - Jakt: Built for Serenity OS, not sure if it's getting enough attention - Jai: Focused on game programming, good reviews, but currently closed source (beta) - Mojo: (Python-like) Seems very interesting and I'd give it a try, but too focused on GPU/parallel programming; also too early for adoption reply",

Many Rust programs try to achieve memory safety while using a non-memory-safe language (be it C or unsafe Rust), and there's an entire spectrum of combining language features that offer sound guarantees with careful analysis and testing of unsafe code to achieve a safe program.

I feel like my biggest struggle is simply how hard (tedious?) it is to properly work with generics and some more complex applications of traits. Any time I am working with (especially writing, somehow reading is easier) these, I always take an ungodly amount of time to do anything productive. I am almost certainly sure this is a skill issue -- I am simply not \"Rusting\" like I am supposed to. Maybe I overuse generics, maybe I rely on traits too much, maybe I am trying to abstract stuff away too much. But this is one of the reasons I want to also explore other languages in the space, especially ones which make it impossible for me to make this so complex. Don't get me wrong -- all of this complexity is a joy to work with when I can use my brain. But sometimes, it's just too much effort to do stuff, and it feels like I could be getting away with less. Curiously, I never had a problem with the borrow checker, even though people often complaining about how much it forces them to \"stop and think\". Another thing is that C, for some weird reason, always feels \"lower level\" than Rust, and seeing it gives me some sort of weird satisfaction that Rust does not. Maybe it's just a greener grass syndrome, but wanted to mention it nonetheless. All this said, I want to just emphasise, that despite this shortcoming (if it even is one), if I were forced to choose a language to spend the rest of my life with, I would not be the least bit sad to only ever use Rust again.

Is this related to the problem where, if you want to put a generic in a data structure (e.g. an implementation of `Write`), you find yourself propagating a generic bound up an entire hierarchy of data structures and functions using those structures? Asking because one thing that's common amongst Rust developers is a bit of an aversion to using `dyn Trait` types, and using a `Box<dyn Write>` (for instance) in the right place can wildly simplify your program. > But sometimes, it's just too much effort to do stuff, and it feels like I could be getting away with less. The next times you find this feeling arising, please feel free to reach out, if you'd like; I would genuinely love to hear about it. You can reach me by DM on the Rust Zulip, or by the email in my profile. > Another thing is that C, for some weird reason, always feels \"lower level\" than Rust, and seeing it gives me some sort of weird satisfaction that Rust does not. Maybe it's just a greener grass syndrome, but wanted to mention it nonetheless. I was originally a C developer, and I can sympathize.

Again, the goal of writing a memory-safe program is understandable, but there's more than one way to achieve that goal when it comes to language guarantees. That doesn't only apply to languages that offer fewer guarantees than Rust, but also to languages that are possibly less low-level (e.g. OCaml, Nim). But even for educational purposes, using a language with a poor selection of libraries is likely to lead to a bad experience if what you want to produce is working, non-trivial software. Every project includes some \"boring\" aspects -- such as parsing configuration and data files -- that you won't necessarily enjoy writing from scratch. The overall programming experience is shaped by much more than the design of the language alone. reply",

There are languages that, at least in principle, \"cure\" far, far more than Rust or even Java do, such as ATS or Idris. Why don't we always use them? Because it's hard! What we've gradually learned since the 70s (when a prevailing thought was that we'll have to use proofs to scale software) is that the cost of soundness can be high, and unsound methods (such as tests) are surprisingly effective in practice, and so \"more sound guarantees\" is not always the best answer. We now believe that for the best correctness per unit of effort we don't want no guarantees at all as in C, and we also don't want to guarantee everything as in ATS, but we're looking for some sweet spots in between. We haven't yet figured out what \"the best\" sweet spot is or, indeed, if there even is only one. reply",

That means proving properties of your code, implying Rice's theorem. It doesn't. Rice's theorem talks about the undecidability of proving some arbitrary property of arbitrary programs, but given a property, one can construct a language in which it trivially holds for all programs in the language. This is done by finding an inductive invariant -- one that is preserved by all program operations -- that implies the property. Let me give you an example. Due to Rice's theorem, it is undecidable whether or not the output of an arbitrary program that yields a number output is even. Nevertheless, it's easy to construct a language (even a Turing-complete one) where this property always holds. We find a stronger invariant -- all numbers in the program are even -- that can be easily made inductive. Indeed, even numbers are closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication, while for every division operation we add a runtime check that panics if the result is odd (and, of course, the compiler rejects any literal that isn't even). And voila! Not every program that yields an even output can be written in this language, but every program in this language yields an even output. To see that this is what Rust does with memory safety, note that while every program in safe Rust is memory-safe, not every memory-safe program can be written in safe Rust. > If it's easy (doable) to go 100% memory safe, then there should be a trivial way to always rely on memory guarantees. No need for a spectrum.

But it isn't because you assume that a language that makes more guarantees will always produce more correct programs per unit of effort, but we know that to be false . From the vantage point of ATS and Idris, a language like Rust is almost indistinguishable from C. There are a few more properties it guarantees than C does, but ATS/Idris can be used to guarantee any program property. If what I said is a nirvana fallacy, then you must not use Rust and always use ATS, because it is much better on your definition of better. The reason we don't is that we know more sound guarantees are not always better, but we didn't always know that. In the seventies, software correctness researchers (such as Tony Hoare) assumed that the only path to scaling software would be soundness (proofs, and even formal proofs). As time went on, we learnt that this belief was false from both sides: unsound methods proved surprisingly effective [1], and proofs proved costly to scale, to the point that they made achieving a required level of correctness more costly. > If you avoid things that are hard, you'll never grow. If a programming language you learned didn't cause headaches, it's not a programming language, it's a dialect. The problem is not in learning new languages. The problem is that more sound guarantees can sometimes reduce the cost of correctness and sometimes increase it. Don't get me wrong: Soundness and proofs sometimes work very well, but we in the software correctness/formal methods world know that things are much more complicated than \"more soundness more better\".

I am not talking about Rust in particular. I'm talking about your general point that more soundness is always better, and your claim that my argument is an example of a nirvana fallacy because I compare an imperfect solution to a hypothetical perfect one. I am trying to explain that we know that more soundness is sometimes worse for correctness in practice. The problem is not that more soundness isn't perfect, but that there are currently better solutions than more soundness in some situations. You seem to be unaware of the shift in software correctness since the seventies. The gap between the size of programs we can prove correct using deductive methods (currently ~10KLOC) and the size of programs produced in industry is only growing. That is why there's been a shift from deductive proofs to methods such as concolic testing (e.g. KLEE). You can see that by looking at the programs for any software verification / formal methods conference. To be clear, I am not saying that more soundness is never better; I'm saying it is sometimes worse. You can say that we should use ATS more, but the effort of producing software that's proven correct with ATS is not justified by the additional correctness guarantees you gain.

Of course. It shouldn't rely on human verification at all. That's how we design type systems. But because an inductive invariant is inherently conservative and must reject correct programs, there is additional human effort required -- not to verify the property, but to stay within the confines of the inductive invariant.

One thing I am wary of is using a truly massive language like C++ on a multi-programmer project without consensus on which features to use and how to use them.  Maybe you have in mind something like that? If you want the simplicity of C with more safety, maybe tooling like Frama-C, a MISRA C conformance checker, or just aggressive use of static and dynamic analysis tools like ASAN and UBSAN.  You can also disable certain optimizations (e.g., strict aliasing) to steer away from some of the major pitfalls of UB. reply",

As for other stuff, I was working on a LLVM extension a while back to put a lot of Python-isms into C, like the array slicing, print statement,  f strings, and decorators. Generally though, I found that writing your own macros is actually easy, and you just have to type stuff out a bit more. Last project I worked on in C I had an include file that had all the macros and the defined functions to go with the macros. The print statement honestly takes up most of the file, cause its a combination of vararg in the macro with _Generic selector with functions defined on how to print each type of variable. But the rest of the stuff like array slicing is just a macro that calls a function that takes the slice arguments as a string. Doesn't look as nice as actual array slicing, but it works and easy to write. reply",

You need to find out who the strict teachers are that will not put up with that behavior and know how to gently correct it. Ask to meet with the teacher and/or administration at the school to come up with a behavior plan you can all agree to, they have counselors and social workers on staff that deal with this and have behavior plans they have used before. If their current teacher is very lax with behavior correction then asking to change teachers is a valid approach. Then follow that plan and expect the teacher to also follow that plan at school. Usually a plan will involve rewarding good behavior and punishing bad, pretty simple. Consistency is key. Ask the administration about what teachers are better at classroom management, those are the ones that will be able to help your child better than a fresh graduate 25yo most likely. Edit to add: punishment should not be severe but there might not be much leeway if your child is hitting other humans. reply",

Some of it is purposeful practicing of stressful interactions in a group environment where all the involved children are working on things, so there's more room to have measured and calm reactions to physical outbursts. It's likely that they may be helpful in working with the school to figure out strategies that are effective and that fit within what the school is willing to do. If you can, you may also consider alternate arrangements. You can't go through life avoiding situations that result in being overwhelmed, ignored, or forced into things you don't want to do but it's generally easier to tolerate it as you develop; taking a pause and putting the child into an environment that is easier for them to manage and/or more supportive for now and returning when they're more able to manage and self-regulate could be helpful (or not) for the child. Sometimes a year or even a few months of growth makes an enormous difference in capability to manage difficult situations. reply",

          "text": "So, let’s assume the child in question lives in a household without trauma, is not neurodivergent, and is otherwise emotionally stable. In that case what works best is reinforcement. Reward good behavior with praise and treats while punishing bad behavior both emotionally and with reprisals. It’s the same as training a dog and it works well with children, especially when there are multiple iterations and parental consistency. For children with trauma this might require extended learning time. For children with autism there is not a straightforward or predictable answer. As a parent you must accept the reality that when your child starts school they are entering a world beyond your control under rules and influences that are not your own. If, as a parent, you cannot stomach that loss of control, you might have to consider home schooling. This is something every parent goes through. reply",

          "text": "Have you heard of I Can Problem Solve (ICPS)? There are four rungs of a \"ladder\" where we want to get to the top, problem-solving. In descending order, we get explanations (if..that), suggestions (\"Tell her you're sorry.\"), and power (the bottom rung): \"Go to time-out!\" Cover of such a book: https://openlibrary.org/books/OL27073744M/I_Can_Problem_Solv... --- Five basic principles, applicable to children as young as age 4, underlie the dialoguing process. The only prerequisite is that children understand the basic word concepts used by the adult. Relatively consistent application of these principles in time helps children associate their newly acquired thinking skills with what they do and how they behave. First, both child and teacher must identify the problem. Casually saying, \"What happened?\"; \"What's the matter?\" or \"Tell me about it\" not only helps the child clarify the problem but also ensures that you will not jump to a faulty conclusion about what is going on. For example, \"Oh, now I see what the problem is. I thought you were mad because your friend took your truck. Now I see it's because she played with it too long and won't give it back.\" Discovering the child's view of the problem starts the dialoguing process on the proper course. Second, when dialoguing, it is important to understand and deal with the real problem. The child in the preceding example thinks he has already shared his truck with his friend, but the teacher may see this child grab the truck and erroneously assume that grabbing is the problem. Actually, grabbing is the child's solution to the problem of getting his truck back, not the problem itself. The real problem is that the child wants his truck back. Third, once the real problem has been identified, the teacher must not alter it to fit his or her own needs. Suppose that the teacher becomes intention showing the child in the example how to share his toys. Because the child is thinking only about how to get back a toy he knows he has already shared, the teacher's guidance will likely lead to resistance. In this case, attempting to teach the \"right\" thing to do may backfire. Fourth, the child, not the teacher, must solve the problem. If the child is to develop the habit of thinking of his own solutions to problems and considering the potential consequences of his actions, he must be encouraged to think for himself. More than simply \"listening\" to the child, the teacher must actively draw out what the child thinks caused the problem, how he and others feel about the situation, his ideas about how to solve the difficulty, and what he thinks might happen if he were to put those ideas into action. In highlighting the child's thinking, the teacher does not offer solutions to the problem or suggest what might happen next. When not bombarded with \"don'ts\" or offered a stream of \"do's,\" the child is freed to think through the problem and decide for himself what and what not to do. The teacher only asks questions and, through these, guides and encourages the emergence of problem-solving thinking. Finally, the focus is on how the child thinks, not on what he thinks (in other words, the specific conclusions he comes to). Research on the ICPS program suggests that the process of a child's thinking is more important in the long run than the content of a specific solution. Attention is therefore focused on developing a style of thinking that will help the child deal with interpersonal problems in general, not on solving the immediate problem to the teacher's satisfaction (although this often occurs). Praising a solution may inhibit further thought about other ideas. Criticizing a solution may inhibit the child's speaking freely about what is on his mind. In either case, the child's thinking will shift from generating options, consequences, and causes to selecting the one thing that meets with teacher approval. In applying these principles, the teacher transmits to the child the value judgment that thinking is important, and the child learns that thinking meets with adult approval. When Not to Dialogue It is not possible or even necessary to dialogue every problem that comes up. In fact, there are times when dialoguing is not effective and its use is better postponed. Clearly, if a child has been or is likely to be physically harmed, your first priority is to help by removing the child from danger. reply",

          "text": "Hey, I’m a parent of a child with severe Tourettes and ADHd. I just thought I’d share my 2c worth: While all kids struggle with disinhibition, it sounds like your child might have a harder time with inhibiting unwanted behaviours (so struggling with disinhibition). This is actually quite common in a lot of children, and nothing to be too concern about, although if it’s disruptive to his own education and opportunities for socialising with other kids, you will need some form of extra support. Your child is not naughty or bad on purpose, rather, a better way to frame it is their nervous system might be a bit more reactive and a little bit more impulsive that some other kids.  Understanding that can help inform better strategies for managing it. My main question is, is your child showing any signs of trying to regulate himself already that you can leverage? \nIt took me a while to realise that my son was regulating in ways I wasn’t recognising because I didn’t understand his struggle. An example was that for a while he had a tic where every time he picked up a pen he had the urge to throw it at a wall. So he stopped using pens. The school panicked and tried to say he was autistic and regressing. But once someone eventually asked him why he wouldn’t hold a pen, he just told us, it was because he didn’t want to throw them. Once they realise that, they gave him a computer to type with instead. So looking for the ways he may be already regulating himself that might not make sense to you but make sense to him will also start to help you understand what is driving the behaviours. Another point I want to make though is that mainstream school is genuinely a very damaging place for kids who struggle with behaviour/conduct issues/disinhibition. Schools isolate these children, and they ostracise them, thereby sabotaging the child’s access to equitable education, limiting the opportunities to form healthy friendships with peers and destroying their self-esteem, basically effectively reinforcing antisocial behaviours. I think if you have the resources you should consider alternative schooling options like Montessori type schools, private schools, private tutoring, or even home schooling. I can guarantee your child is probably an incredibly creative, wonderful person with so much potential, but he’s probably just wired slightly different. Schools don’t foster creativity, they foster uniformity, they don’t foster curiosity, they foster reciting of facts unquestioningly. Western schooling systems also teach people to mindlessly follow authority without questioning it, which also has its repercussions. Your child is probably not the real issue when they’re at school. School will be the issue. Schools/teachers often know very little about paediatric brain development and behaviour. They treat children like mini-adults. Furthermore, teachers are often incredibly overworked under-resourced and underpaid. Even when they want to do better for each individual child, they are not equipped to. My final piece of advice is that no matter how deeply frustrating the behaviours continue to manage your child’s behaviour with firm but fair boundaries, lots of love and reassurance that they are loved, lots of reassurance that they’re intelligent and full of potential, and a great deal of patience. He will naturally grow out of a lot this behaviour. It’s his self-esteem and self efficacy you want to protect a long the way. reply",

The consequences have to permeate through his whole life. My mother did not put an end to that bullshit when she should have, and it lasted far too long. If you are dealing with anything like what I think you are dealing with, then the bully will come out soon as you start limiting any type of fun at home. Don't go nuts though, just basic stuff like \"we're eating corn and no TV from now on\" works, trust me.

          "text": "This will evoke mixed feelings, but having been involved in child development for a very long time, I can say that in some cases it is acceptable to carefully and very thoughtfully \"spank\" your child. Spanking should never be performed out of frustration or anger on your part. There should also always be a delay (at least a short one) between the incident and the spanking so as to allow some processing both for you and your child and to decide if it is right and then for them to internalize the punishment that is about to come. Additionally, spanking, in my opinion and experience, should only be performed when your child had injured someone since injury is something that they cannot restore or pay back. No matter the age, they must be made to understand the reason for such an action of spanking in connection with their action. I would caution, again, that spanking should only be utilized when there is no other restitution possible such as when they are harming another individual. I do not know of any states that directly outlaw such an action by parents, but if there are such laws, obey your laws. Having said this, I would also tell you that you MUST only spank after you have: 0. Make sure your child knows here is this consequence if they injure someone. Let them know there is a consequence! Do not let them think that arbitrary punishments or retribution occurs. This will do more harm than good if you do not set the expectations. It's not entirely possible to always do this the first time or with very, very small children (such as a two year old that has a biting problem as an example and which is very damaging behavior). 1. Explained what is about to happen carefully and fully. 2. Only spank once or a couple of times in a very controlled and sterile manner. Do NOT get emotionally involved in the spanking except to feel bad that you are doing it. DO NOT SPANK IF YOU ARE ANGRY. DON'T DO IT. NEVER. 3. After the spanking show your child MORE love and care. Give them high levels of tenderness and show them that it hurt you to execute this punishment. If you can cry with them, CRY WITH THEM. This is very important to show forth more love after the punishment and by doing this you will actually improve your bond with your child and allow them to know that you harbor no ill will against them. 4. Remind them in the future about the consequences that will occur if they choose to harm someone else as they have done. 5. Always show your child love and always let them know you suffer when they suffer now and always. Learn empathy and if you cannot have it, then show sympathy and love them anyway even if you cannot feel such things yourself. reply",

With these new findings, we also know it can have potential impact on brain development, changing biology, and leading to lasting consequences.” > Perhaps surprisingly, says Cuartas, spanking elicits a similar response in children’s brains to more threatening experiences like sexual abuse. “You see the same reactions in the brain,” Cuartas explains. “Those consequences potentially affect the brain in areas often engaged in emotional regulation and threat detection, so that children can respond quickly to threats in the environment.” https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/usable-knowledge/21/04/eff... https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cdev.13... reply",

It is a form of communication that is very hard to recover from if it is not done properly and with supernal parental love.

The hard parts, besides accumulating active users, are unique product identification and reputation system to prevent fake data flooding.

However, in real retail the codes on the tags are regularly as small as possible and sometimes do not even correspond with the one on the product (don't know how this works). Means you need to scan them really close, individually. You also can't rely on placement for augmenting missing/trimmed textual data on tags with identifying the actual item on the shelf as in many places it's consistently messed up (as if on purpose). reply",

I could then enter some preferences like \"avoid products from countries engaging in genocide\" and after scanning such a product it could tell me if a product failed one of my filters. I did some research towards this end and found some existing tools that could be useful: - https://github.com/Forceu/barcodebuddy/ (Barcode system for Grocy) - https://world.openfoodfacts.org/ (Open Food Facts is a food products database made by everyone, for everyone. You can use it to make better food choices, and as it is open data, anyone can re-use it for any purpose.) We tend to think that our only power is at the voting both and there it often feels negligible. I believe that we actually hold a lot of economic power through our consumption choices, especially those of us in first world economies or with higher income. Not only could this be more influential that casting a vote every four or five years, but it actually gives you the opportunity to express a much more nuanced view rather than picking one of two (or a handful of) politicians who represent a portfolio of policies that might not be that different from each other (thus offering no real choice) or where you have to pick the lesser of two evils (thus implicitly endorsing policies you disagree with). Currently this economic power is largely squandered (except for extreme cases like boycotts), like misaligned magnetic dipoles in a ferromagnet cancelling each other out in the absence of an external magnetic field. If instead we could get all the individuals to align, consumers in the economic force case or atomic or molecular magnetic dipoles in the magnetism case, then the same collection of individuals is able to produce a powerful force field with real effects. reply",

It wasn't legal to crowdsource it; stores had to share it willingly. I'm not sure of the Act is still there, but we ended up pivoting around it. You can skirt laws like Uber did and sometimes change them. But be aware of the how far you can skirt them. If you're making a political statement, be extra careful. In our case, shops were unhappy because of the business model. They overcharged on some things and made others look cheap, but to whomever they targeted, they wanted to look cheap. When we compared a grocery list between multiple shops, it turns out most had similar totals. It would have encouraged user behavior where they buy chicken in this shop, salmon there, diapers in another shop. And because all of these were loss leaders, it would have been bad for the stores overall. Also consider the protectionist environment that brings about tariffs and the current hostile climate against \"tech bros\", and it's a doubly bad idea - if the law doesn't get you, the mob will. But if they share it with you willingly, it's normally legal and less work. We had a phase when implementing GST where companies would advertise that they were not raising prices. All you have to do is verify this. You can even charge an advertising fee. reply",

The computer in the store that drives the POS scanners then can print out the shelf label stickers and a poor sod goes and replaces the stickers on the shelves. This is all a big secret of course, so asking a grocery store for their prices is going to get you nowhere. You could try scraping the websites, but often the price for online shopping is different to what is in store. Best bet would be to offer an incentive for people to scan their receipts into your app.  I don't know what kind of incentive you could build to do that, maybe for every 5 receipts you could offer a coupon or something.  Not much of an idea and a massive PITA, it would also only give prices on those things that people bought. edit:  also gets complicated for multi-item discounts or combination discounts reply",

          "text": "There's a story that goes: A man was tasked with hiring an employee. He got hundreds of resumes. His friend looks at the stack and asks him \"how are you going to decide among all those?\" The man grabs half the stack, throws it in the garbage and says \"Simple, I don't hire unlucky people\". Degrees matter when employers don't have the time and/or ability to make a reasonable decision for every candidate. They need ways to eliminate chunks of the applications. Illogical ways of eliminating candidates are acceptable because they are better than having no way. One method that's not completely illogical is to only look at candidates who have degrees. You can get degrees for <15K. For a BSCS you can do WGU for 5/10K. For a MSCS you can do GaTech OMSCS for 7K. Those numbers are small enough that they're almost definitely worth it. But those also cost time, which you will have to decide for yourself if you want to spend. reply",

          "text": "I think you should ask yourself two related but separate questions: 1. Will the CS degree increase your knowledge and problem-solving ability faster than you could without it? 2. Will the credential add substantially to your credibility for hiring managers? The answer to 1 is mostly about your level of self-discipline and ability to learn independently. If you need the stimulus of a structured environment and a peer group to learn at your best, then any accredited program will be helpful, and your ability to pass coding interviews will increase (with a lot of hard work beyond the curriculum). The answer to 2 is pretty straightforward: unless your degree is from a tier 2+ school, the raw credential is of little value, and even tier 2 is not certain. To count, an online degree must be presented by the school as competitive with an on-site degree. Georgia Tech offers such a degree program as a tier 1 school, for example. An unaccredited program is of no value whatsoever in answer to 1 or 2. So, avoid them at any price. You are looking at a 3-5 year project, no matter what, and this is probably a good time to do that. The market will take that long to sort itself out and to realize that vibe coding is NOT the miracle it seems. reply",

          "text": "I take issue with your idea that it is \"tier 2+\" that are the only programs that are worth it. When you make statements like that, or prognostications of that nature, you have to think about how it actually is in reality and not as the kinds of base opinions that are found in Reddit CS careers subs. I think this varies widely for employers and even within teams of large employers, depending on who is the person doing the hiring. Even at a simplistic level having a degree from a regionally accredited institutions will decide whether you pass the first HR screen, so it cannot be equivalent to no credential at all. This just fails a basic real world sensibility test. Are you saying a CS grade from Montana State University that is a hiring manager at FAANG (maybe even the most famous one) is going to consider someone with a degree from Stevens or Florida Institute of Technology to be equivalent to someone without a degree? I don't know if you are aware but there many people employed CS grads that did not attend the top 3. Also, I don't know about tiers, but these rankings are largely based on research and not quality of undergraduate program or outcomes. The idea of telling someone that doesn't have a degree that wants to know of if attaining a degree could likely help their career that they should not go if it is not \"tier 2+,\" whatever that is, is just kind of malpractice.  Georgia Tech is not the only school that offers such a degree that is equivalent to their in-person program. I would agree that you should choose a school that has a traditional program for which this online program is just a different modality, rather than one of these online-only predatory type of schools. reply",

Words are indirect references to ideas and ideas are like raw marble in your head, carved into meaningful shapes by working with and manipulating those ideas.

There's a hidden bias in that this is only people who got through recruiters and recruiters are their own filter. Strong referrals usually guaranteed a phone screens. I think previous experience at a major competitor in the same tier or a degree from a top CS school were also meaningful, but I don't know how else they filtered. There is a non trivial relationship between colleges and businesses, so you are likely to do many problems in college that are not terribly different from the interview questions. Additionally all of your peers have been interviewed/do interviews/do referrals and that does matter. College students generally did not do incredibly well on practical problems, so I would expect a non college candidate to do really well on them. Many of the best co-workers that I remember had physics degrees. In fact, it was so pronounced I personally consider a physics degree to be a top tier signal of programming ability, but that's my own personal prejudice. If your degree isn't from a top 10-20 CS school it's probably not worth it if you have experience. If you can't make friends while doing the courses, then I don't think it's worth it. Going to a good college is much much much much more than a few lectures, some book reading, and some assignments. It is face to face time with world class experts, it's a culture, it's social, it's exploratory. You can potentially work on bleeding edge research or be introduced to things you never knew existed. It sounds like your idea of what college is, is that it's a technical education rather than a liberal education. If that's true I think your perception of college is wrong. There are some situations where a college degree really matters. If you want to apply for a work visa in a foreign country, a degree from a good college can potentially get your application a rubber stamp or lack of one could completely restrict you from it. reply",

Personally I’d get or build a comfortable van and visit lots of parts of the US and Canada where I’ve never been. Reflect on nature’s beauty and be alone with my thoughts, and peaceful. Obviously there is another kind of travel that’s more focused on luxury/hedonism/etc. that’s not my thing, and in my humble opinion risks getting caught up in alcohol/drugs/empty sex/etc. would not recommend especially because the temptation of doing all of the above to excess would be there if you’re popping bottles in Miami Beach or whatever. One thing you might want to do would be to see who would like to have you as an advisor for their startup. You successfully did a hard thing that thousands are desperate to do. Many could benefit from your learned lessons. You could offer to give talks at your alma mater, help vet people’s startup ideas, etc. I know you may not feel like you’re some genius or oracle but you’d make a much better judge of that kind of thing than I would! reply",

I’m not sure what to do next — with my time, my energy, or even with my life. You may be tempted to fill your time and spend your energy and money on things that take your mind off of \"life\". Drugs, alcohol, gambling, carnal pleasures, clubbing, etc. It will spiral and you'll lose your life, health, and wealth. You are a prime target for leeches and parasites who smell a lonely soul with a full wallet a mile away. Were you to need an addiction to \"cope\" and \"avoid reality\", make it an addiction that could: 1 - fade a way 2 - not ruin your health, wealth, and time. 3 - become a net positive For instance: picking up a sport (judo, jiu-jitsu, wrestling), hiking, pursuing a degree, going to workshops that make you work with your hands (masonry, ceramics, carpentry, agriculture, stonewalls, manufacturing/fabrication). These may be coping mechanisms and just a \"transition\", but they are virtuous coping mechanisms and I don't see you regretting your masonry classes; on the contrary, you will have acquired a skill for life even if/after your interest \"fades away\", and may even become your business. In other words, please be very careful and deliberate about how you spend your health, time, and money. You'll also be tempted to brood and stay home or on the contrary, be out all night and chasing pleasures, hence my recommendations on physical activities (judo and masonry) for you really ought to stay connected with your body and physical being especially now. If you work out, don't stop. If you don't, start. reply",

Remember being super pissed at him 3 weeks after the funeral, when he said that the first year if the worst. But he was right. I really regret not going to a psychologist. I didn't know how to explain it to the family doctor to make him send me to one (live in Norway, where taxes are insane, but if you make your case right, you get almost free medical assistance, capped at $300/y). I also didn't know it was worth it even with costs that seemed prohibitive. It's worth knowing, that psychologists are like programmers - not everyone is good at everything. Find a couple specializing in supporting grieving people, see at least 3 and decide which one fits you best. Sending love, hope you get better! reply",

          "text": "The technical term for where you've arrived at is \"mid life crisis\" - albeit a bit earlier than most. Your search for success is over. So the next step becomes the search for significance. First though, as others have said, your \"what to do next\" is colored by the natural grieving process you need to go through. Accept that your emotions will likely be all over the place for a while. This isn't a time for big decisions, but rather smaller, quieter, times for you to find a new simple routine. Once your life has returned to (emotional) normal, then you can start the next chapter. Being significant means making a difference, on the people around you, on your environment, and so on. Like with most things, there's no \"quick path\". You need to try this, try that, and see what sticks. Local charities are always a good place to start (they can use the help) but they may just be a stepping stone till you find your place. Interacting with youth in some way (school, church, clubs etc) can also be very inspirational (for you and for them.) Kids like to hear stories of success (they're still on that path) and hearing it from someone young - closer to their own age - really sticks. Most of all, don't panic if you wake up tomorrow with nothing to do. You've got a long road ahead. You don't need to rush. Take some time to just settle down. Maybe go on a trip to somewhere peaceful. Good luck. reply",
