Punting it to 2026. I'm thinking to get the Samsung Galaxy XR and experiment with some VR apps and learn the fundamentals of spatial computing. As an Android mobile developer, that feels like a natural extension.<p>- Complete the \"UCSanDiegoX: Computer Graphics II: Rendering\" computer graphics course. I did the first course in the series and found it enlightening (no pun intended)<p>- Create an e2e project that earns money as a side gig. It's time to put my product and technical knowledge to practice and actually build something people want.<p>- Leverage AI across all my endeavors. AI tools are here to stay and the more I know how to use them effectively, the better. The speed boost in learning a new framework/concept is phenomenal.<p>Non-technical skills:<p>- Expand my social circle - the unstable tech climate made me realize the importance of maintaining a healthy social network. My goal is to connect with more people both inside my company and outside, by both proactively reaching out and going to meetups in my area. In fact, I invite fellow NYC-based HN-ers to contact me at cybercreampuff at yahoo dot com, in case you want to meet up!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "This is a new years resolution question barely in disguise, but they're fun cause a lot of us are cooped up, barely 4 days into winter, 86ish to go, and we're champing at the bit for change. I am pretty sure I'm a 50th percentiler. I'm mid 40s, kinda burned out but still struggling forward in my ok-but-not-hollywood IT career, I still have a passion for doing things well in a technical society that values doing things cheap (and well). The things I am known for being good at, I still google daily, and for a long time, I've been hungry for a change - any change - but especially one that isn't chaotically negative. So in 2026, I wanna learn how dirt works. I actually have a giant box of dirt sitting on a shelf at the UNH community co-op soil analysis lab, waiting to give me some kind of data about the soil behind my house. (Or is it dirt? I don't know what I'm getting into). In 2024 I tried growing some corn. It never sprouted. In 2025 I tried growing some corn. It sprouted and a few ears had enough kernels to make one full mouthful. Tasty, but maybe 7 calories of food for a year of effort. So in 2026 I'd like to grow: one entire fully formed ear of sweet corn. Anything else is a bonus. That's what I wanna develop in 2026 - learning how soil works enough to make it make a thing.  Small moves, Ellie. reply",

          "text": "Great hobby! A couple of things about corn. It might not be soil at issue. Germination depends on correct temperature and moisture. Too much moisture the seed will rot or not have enough air to germinate. Too little moisture it won't trigger germination. Too deep it won't germinate, too shallow and germination won't happen either because it will dry out instead of staying moist. Seeds vary in depth they require and some even require light to germinate (doesn't apply to corn). It's a bit of an art figuring out what \"even moisture until germination\" is, and this varies based on soil type. Timing of planting with correct temperature is important. Each kernel of corn has one silk. The silk is analogous to a Fallopian tube with pollen traveling down into the ovary (or kernel of corn in this case). If you have an ear of corn with only a few kernels it's often because pollen didn't land on all the silks. For this reason corn is usually planted in blocks. It's wind pollinated so wind shakes pollen off the tassels or male flowers at the top, down onto the silk. But if you just have one corn plant in isolation, or a row in isolation it's easier for the pollen to just blow away or miss. Planting in blocks or \"array of arrays\" configuration helps the pollen to reach the silk more uniformly as pollen from the surrounding plants is released. reply",

          "text": "That's kinda wild to hear about the corn because I've found corn to be one of the easiest crops to grow. If you want to try again, these are the seeds I last used which had 100% germination and produced plenty of ears of corn. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005MI33BS I've also had a ton of luck growing corn in 5 gallon buckets with holes drilled in the side to allow air into the soil which keeps the roots from balling up (wasting energy that should go into growing ears).  Used potting mix with a handful of lime and a handful of epsom salt, and topped the buckets with mulch to retain moisture. If you're willing to try that approach, this was very similar to my system: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptgJn15TmRM reply",

I have similar years experience and regularly try out AI for development but always find it’s slower for the things I want to build and/or that it produces less than satisfactory results. Not sure if it’s how I use the models (I’ve experimented with all the frontier ones), or the types of things I’m building, or the languages I’m using, or if I’m not spending enough, or if it’s just my standards are too high for the code that is produced but I usually always end up going back to doing things by hand. I try to keep the AI focused on small well defined tasks, use AGENT.MD and skills, build out a plan first, followed by tests for spec based development, keep context windows and chats a reasonable length etc, but if I add up all that time I could have done it myself and have better grasp of the program and the domain in the process. I keep reading how AI is a force multiplier but I’m yet to see it play out for myself. I see lots of posts talking about how much more productive AI has made people, but very few with actual specifics on setup, models, costs, workflows etc. I’m not an AI doomer and would love to realize the benefits people are claiming they get.... but how to get there is the question reply",

Then I wrote a large feature (ad pacing) on a site using LLMs. I learned the LLMs did not really understand what they were doing. The algorithm (PID controller) itself was properly implemented (as there is plenty of data to train on), but it was trying to optimize the wrong thing. There were other similar findings where LLM was doing very stupid mistakes. So I went through a disillusionment stage and kind of gave up for a while. Since then, I have learned how to use Claude Code effectively. I have used it mostly on existing Django code bases. I think everybody has a slightly different take on how it works well. Probably the most reasonable advice is to just keep going and try different kind of things. Existing code bases seem easier, as well as working on a spec beforehand, requiring tests etc. basic SWE principles. reply",

This is where I’ve been at for a while now. Every couple of months I try again with latest models and latest techniques I hear people talking about but there’s very little concrete info there that works for me. Then I wonder if it’s just my spend? I don’t mind spending $30/month to experiment but I’m not going to drop $300/month unless I can see evidence that it’ll be worth it, which I haven’t really seen, but maybe there’s a dependency and you don’t get the result without increased spend?

          "text": "> This is step 3 of “draw the rest of the owl” :-) Fair enough :-) This reminds me about pigeon research by Skinner. Skinner placed hungry pigeons in a \"Skinner box\" and a mechanism delivered food pellets at fixed, non-contingent time intervals, regardless of the bird's behavior. The pigeons, seeking a pattern or control over the food delivery, began to associate whatever random action they were performing at the moment the food appeared with the reward. I think we humans have similar psychology, i.e. we tend to associate superstitions about patterns of what were doing when we got rewards, if they happen at random intervals. To me it seems we are at a phase where what works with LLMs *(the reward) are still quite random, but it is psychologically difficult for us to admit it. Therefore we try to invent various kinds of theories of why something appears to work, which are closer to superstitions than real repeatable processes. It seems difficult to really generalize repeatable processes of what really works, because it depends on too many things. This may be the reason why you are unsuccessful when using these descriptions. But while it seems less useful to try to work based on theories of what works -- although I had skeptical attitude -- I have found that LLMs can be huge productive boost -- but it really depends on the context. It seems you just need to keep trying various things, and eventually you may find out what works for you. There is no shortcut where you just read a blog post and then you can do it. Things I have tried succesfully:\n- modifying existing large-ish Django projects, adding new apps to it. It can sometimes use Django components&HTMX/AlpineJS properly, but sometimes starts doing something else. One app uses tenants, and LLM appears to constantly struggle with this.\n- creating new Django projects -- this was less successful than modifying existing projects, because LLM could not imitate practices\n- Apple Swift mobile and watch applications. This was surprisingly succesful. But these were not huge apps.\n- python GUI app was more or less succesful\n- GitHub Pages static web sites based on certain content I have not copied any CLAUDE.md or other files. Every time Claude Code does something I don't appreciate, I add a new line. Currently it is at 26 lines. I have made a few skills. They are mostly so that they can work independently in a loop, for example test something that does not work. Typically I try to limit the technologies to something I know really well. When something fails, I can often quickly figure out what is wrong. I started with the basic plan (I guess it is that $30/month). I only upgraded to $100 Max and later to $180 2xMax because I was hitting limits. But reason I was hitting limits was because I was working on multiple projects on multiple environments at the same time.  The only difference I have seen is that I have hit the limits. I have not seen any difference in quality. reply",

          "text": "Thanks for the info. I try a mix of things I know well and things I want to play around with. Swift and iOS was something that didn’t work so well for me.  I wanted to play around with face capture and spent a day with Claude putting together a small app that showed realtime video of a face and put dots on/around various facial features and printed log messages if the person changed the direction they were looking (up down left right) and played a sound when they opened their mouth. I’ve done app development before, but it’s been a few years so was a little bit rusty and it felt like Claude was really helping me out. Then I got to a point I was happy with and I thought I’d go deeper in the code to understand what it was doing and how it was working (not a delegation issue as per another comment, this was a play/learning exercise for me so wanted to understand how it all worked) - and right there in the apple developer documentation was a sample so that did basically the same thing as my app, only the code was far simpler and after reading through the accompanying docs I realized the Claude version had a threading issue waiting to happen that was explicitly warned against in the docs of the api calls it was using. If I’d gone to the developer docs in the beginning I would have had a better app, and better understanding in maybe a quarter of the time. Appreciate the info on spend.  The above session was on the $30/month version of Claude. I guess I need to just keep flapping my wings until I can draw the owl. reply",

Subjectively interacting with an LLM gives a sense of progress, but objectively downloading a sample project and tutorial gets me to the same point with higher quality materials much faster. I keep thinking about research on file navigation via command line versus using a mouse. People’s subjective sense of speed and capability don’t necessarily line up with measurable outcomes.

          "text": "> I realized the Claude version had a threading issue waiting to happen that was explicitly warned against in the docs of the api calls it was using. I am reading between the lines here, trying genuinely to be helpful, so forgive me if I am not on the right track. But based on what you write, it seems to me you might have not really gone through the disillusionment phase yet. You seem to be assuming the models \"understand\" more than they really are capable of understanding, which creates expectations and then disappointment. It seems to be you are still expecting CC to work at a level of a senior professional on various roles, instead of assuming it is a junior professional. I would have probably approached that iOS app by first investigting various options how the app could be implemented (especially as I don't have deep understanding of the tech), and then explore each option to understand myself what is the best one. The options in your example might be the Apple documentation page. It it might be some open source repo that contains something that could be used as a starting point etc. Then I would have asked Claude to create a plan to implement the best option. During either the option selection or planning, the threading issue would either come up or not. It might come up explicitly, in which case I could learn it from the plans. It might be implicit, just included in the generated code. Or it might not be included in the plans or in the code, even if it is explicitly stated in the documentation. If the suggested plan would be based on that documentation, then I would probably read it myself too, and might have seen the suggestion. When reviewing the plan, I can use my prior knowledge to ask whether that issue has been taken into account. If not, then Claude would modify the plan. Of course, if I did not know about the threading issue beforehand, and did not have the general experience about the tech to suspect such as a issue, nor read the documentation and see the recommendation, I could not find the issue myself either. If the issue is not found in planning or progamming, the issue would arise at later stage, hopefully while unit/system testing the application, or pilot use. I have not written complex iOS apps personally so I might have not caught it either -- I am not senior enough to guide it. I would ask it to plan again how to comprehenively test such an app, to learn how it should be done. What I meant by standard SWE practices is that there are various stages (requirements, specification, design, programming, testing, pilot use) where the solution is reviewed from multiple angles, so it becomes likely that this kind of issues are caught. The best practices also include iteration. Start with something small that works. For example, first an iOS application that compiles, and shows \"Hello, world\" etc. and can be installed on your phone. In my experience, CC cannot be expected to independently work as a senior professional on any role (architect, programmer, test manager, tester, pilot user, product manager, project manager). Junior might not take into account all instructions or guidance even if it is explicit. But it can act as a junior professional on any of these roles, so it can help senior professional to get the 10x productivity boost on any of these areas. By project manager role, I mean that I am explicitly taking the CC through the various SWE stages and making sure they have been done properly, and also that I iterate on the solution. On each one of the stages, I take the role of the respective senior professional. If I cannot do it yet, I try to learn how to do it. At the same time, I work as a product manager/owner as well, to make decisions about the product, based on my personal \"taste\" and requirements. reply",

I mean I'm definitely still in the stage of disillusionment, but I'm not treating LLMs as senior or expecting much from them. The example I gave played out much as you described above. I used an iterative process, with multiple self-contained smaller steps, each with a planning and discussion stage where I got the AI to identify ways to achieve what I was looking to do and weigh up tradeoffs that I then decided on, followed by a design clarification and finalisation stage, before finally getting it to write code (very hard sometimes to get the AI not to write code until the design has been finalised), followed by adjustments to that code as necessary. The steps involved were something like: - build the app skeleton - open a camera feed - display the feed full screen - flip the feed so it responded as a mirror would if you were looking at it - use the ios apis to get facial landmarks - display the landmarks as dots - detect looking in different directions and print a log message. - detect the user opening their mouth - play a sound when the mouth transitions from closed to open - etc Each step was relatively small and self-contained, with a planning stage first and me asking the AI probing/clarifying questions. The threading issue didn't come up at all in any of this. Once it came, the AI tied itself in knots trying to sort it out, coming up with very complex dispatching logic that still got things incorrect. It was a fun little project, but if I compare the output it just wasn't equivalent to what I could get if I'd just started with the Apple documentation (thought maybe it's different now, as per another commenter's reply). It's also easily completeable in a day if you want to give it a try :-)  Apple Developer reference implementation [here]( https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Vision/tracking-th... ). > By project manager role, I mean that I am explicitly taking the CC through the various SWE stages and making sure they have been done properly, and also that I iterate on the solution.

These kind of loops have happened to me as well. It sometimes requires clearing of context + some inventive step to help the LLM out of the loop.

          "text": "I'm pretty sure I have the right intellectual and emotional understanding of the AI and its abilities. > I consider this to be partly what I mean by \"LLM is a junior\" and that \"I act as the project manager\". And this is partly what I mean when I say the time I spend instructing the \"junior\" LLM could be just as well spent implementing the code myself - because the \"project manager\" side of me can work with the \"senior dev\" side of me at the speed of thought and often in parallel, and solving the challenges and the design of something is often where most of the time is spent anyway. Skills are changing this equation somewhat due to the way they can encode repeatable knowledge, but not so much for me yet especially if I'm trying things out in radically different areas (I'm still in my experimental stage with them). > Could you really have done a complex mobile app alone in one day without knowing the stack well beforehand? No, but that's not what happened here. The mobile app wasn't complex (literally only does the things outlined above) and I've done enough mobile development and graphics/computer vision development before that the stack and concepts involved weren't completely unknown, just the specifics of the various iOS APIs and how to string them together - hence why I initially thought it would be a good use case for AI. It was also an incredible coincidence that the toy app I wanted to build had an apple developer tutorial that did almost the same thing as what I was looking to build, and so yes, I clearly would have been better off using the documentation as a starting point rather than the AI. That sort of coincidence won't always exist, but I've thinking lately about another toy iOS/apple watch application, and I checked, and once again there is a developer tutorial that closely matches what I'm looking to build.  If I ever get around to experimenting with that, the developer docs are going to be my first port of call rather than an AI. > I certainly could not have done one year ago what I can do today, with these tools. Right, and if you look back at my original reply (not to you), this is what I'm trying to understand - the what and how of AI productivity gains, because if I evaluate the output I get it's almost always either something I could have built faster and better, or if not faster then at least better and not so much slower that the AI was enabling a week of work to be done in a day, and month of work to be done in a week (claims from the GP, not you). I would love to be able to realize those gains - and I can see the potential but just not the results. reply",

          "text": "I’m perfectly comfortable and used to delegating, but delegation requires  trust that the result will be fit for purpose. It doesn’t have to be exactly how I would do it but at a minimum it has to work correctly and have acceptable performance for the task at hand. This doesn’t mean being super optimized just that it shouldn’t be doing stupid things like n+1 requests or database queries etc. See a sibling comment for one example on correctness, another one related to performance was querying some information from a couple of database tables (the first with 50,000 rows the next with 2.5 million) After specifying things in enough detail to let the AI go, it got correct results but performance was rather slow. A bit more back and forthing and it got up to processing 4,000 rows a second. It was so impressed with its new performance it started adding rocket ship emojis to the output summary. There were still some obvious (to me) performance issues so I pressed it to see if it could improve the performance.  It started suggesting some database config tweaks which provided some marginal improvements but was still missing some big wins elsewhere - namely it was avoiding “expensive” joins and doing that work in the app instead - resulting in n+1 db calls. So I suggested getting the DB to do the join and just processing the fully joined data on the app side. This doubled throughout (8,000 rows/second) and led to claims from the AI this was now enterprise ready code. There was still low hanging fruit though because it was calling the db and getting all results back before processing anything. After suggesting switching to streaming results (good point!) we got up to 10,000 rows/second. This was acceptable performance, but after a bit more wrangling we got things up to 11,000 rows/second and now it wasn’t worth spending much extra time squeezing out more performance. In the end the AI came to a good result, but, at each step of the way it was me hinting it in the correct direction and then the AI congratulating me on the incredible “world class performance” (actual quote but difficult to believe when you then double performance again). If it has just been me I would have finished it in half the time. If I’d delegated to a less senior employee and we’d gone back and forth a bit pairing to get it to this state it might have taken the same amount and effort but they would’ve at least learnt something. Not so with the AI however - it learns nothing and I have to make sure I re-explain things and concepts all over again the next time and in sufficient detail that it will do a reasonable job (not expecting perfection, just needs to be acceptable). And so my experience so far (much more than just these 2 examples) is that I can’t trust the AI to the point where I can delegate enough that I don’t spend more time supervising/correcting it than I would spend writing things myself. Edit: using AI to explain existing code is a useful thing it can do well.  My experience is it is much better at explaining code than producing it. reply",

When I’m writing my own code I can verify the logic as I go and coupled with a strong type system and a judicious use of _some_ tests its generally enough for my code to be correct. By comparison the AI needs more tests to keep it on the right path otherwise the final code is not fit for purpose. For example in a recent use case I needed to take a json blob containing an array of strings that contained numbers and needed to return an array of Decimals sorted in ascending order. This seemed a perfect use case - a short well defined task with clear success criteria so I spent a bunch of time writing the requirements and building out a test suite and then let the AI do its thing. The AI produced ok code, but it was sorted everything lexicographically before converting to a Decimal rather converting to Decimals first and sorting numerically so 1000 was less than 900. So I point it out and the AI says good point, you’re absolutely correct and we add a test for this and it goes again and gets the right result but that’s not a mistake I would have made or needed a test for (though you could argue it’s a good test to have). You could also argue that I should have specified the problem more clearly, but then we come back to the point that if I’m writing every specific detail in English first, it’s faster for me just to write it in code in the first place. reply",

If it fails, it’s not allowed to edit the source code, instead it must determine if there is a bug in the test or the source code. If the test is buggy it should try again, if there is a bug in the source code it should pause, propose a fix, and consult with you on next steps.

I am not going to just deny myself access to apps on schedule -- my brain never clicked schedule, not even once in my life -- but through a persistent and sustainable self-change from deep within. It's slow but it's beginning to work. - MANDATORY: Get more intimate with my Neovim. I've always kind of half-arsed my editors / IDEs, I always found it annoying to become a deep expert. This must change; surface-level skills rob you of productivity. I already am hugely annoyed by my typing speed, which is quite excellent but still not enough to work almost at the speed of thought. I want to achieve something near to these levels. - OPTIONAL: Integrate closer with one ore more LLM agents for coding. I have not paid for any yet but copying-pasting from a web UI gets tiring. Sometimes you really just want to say \"OK, now remove that duplicate test and include that edge case\" and see it materialize in 20 seconds. I am not against paying, it's just that so far the paid tiers have not been a blocker. Well, seems like they are now. - MANDATORY: Prioritize body. I have health conditions and I have a relatively good visibility how to fix them. I regularly end up desperately trying to solve more and more problems on the computer just so I don't get up and start a workout. I started turning this around but it's way too slow and time and age don't wait for anyone. In general: connect better with myself, forgive myself all the previous mistakes, understand why and how they came to be and remove the root causes, put myself on a better path. And above all: be more true to myself. reply",

          "text": "I would not even know how to call my so-called \"technique\" if somebody else did not do it for me: awareness. What I do I would today call \"reconciliation\" or \"making peace\". Let me explain. On the one hand, I start recognizing in a colder, more methodical and mathematical manner, what things I did screw up in my life and why. I drill down and understand what emotions, unmet needs and un-addressed trauma led to these faulty decisions. Then I say: I understand why I did it but this only worked against me, it's time to change it and put myself on a better path. And by \"better path for me\" I don't mean only financial and career success; I mean those _and_ being happier and calmer. On the other hand, I allow my more beastly / primitive / emotional / immature side to show up. I don't shun it, I try to sympathize with it and somewhat validate it. That's basically treating a part of yourself like an angry and lost kid: you do feel for them but want them to stop doing damage. But you also want to not force anything on them; you want them to understand and internalize they are only hurting themselves and others (in this case: other parts of you) with zero benefit for anyone involved. --- It's not easy. I had a very rocky start in life. Sure I did not sleep under bridges but growing up in a shitty Eastern European town with a gay brother and you yourself being the nerd who effortlessly gets all A grades and is also good at karate, physically attractive and liked by girls sadly had a ton of downsides that many people are blind of. Almost everyone hates you for being different and they feel threatened by you while all you want is to fit in and be a part of a friendly group. It was and still is a big tragedy, one I don't claim I have managed to come to terms with even as of today. --- But what I do lately is talk to my more primal side: \"Look, I really understand how much you hate doing X and Y. I hate them too! But what else would you do? We did it your way for so long, you had an almost complete full reign and look what happened -- now we all suffer from severely diminished physical and mental health, we hate our life and often our work, we know that we wasted our best years on pointlessly rebelling against things we could never change. Where did all that bring us? Please, work with me. I understand that you never feel heard because we never achieved the life you wanted. But I can't see any shortcuts. Do you? If not, then let us please take the long but much safer road to our goals. That way we'll still get there one day. If we are not making progress then we'll talk again and readjust strategy and maybe do things more your way. But in the meantime, can we do things my way for a while? Please?\" Or something very similar. But all that is 99% specific to me. You really have to find your own way to your deeper and more primal / emotional side. It exists and very often sabotages you because you never give it the wheel. Being civilized does this to us and no, I am not saying you should go outside and beat someone to death with a ratchet wrench of course. I mean that you should find a way to do the things you truly want, regardless of the cost. I am NOT doing this well at the moment. For example I am too chicken to give up programming. But as mentioned above, I am trying to reconcile a few factors the best way I can for the moment. Maybe if that unlocks more energy and more motivation then the time would be ripe for more drastic measures. One step at a time. reply",

I don't do anything anymore these days to advance my career in SWE.

I often marveled at people who create database, compilers, emulators, 3D engines, version controls, text editors, etc. Those people are like wizards to me. I wonder how can I be creative like that? Like, how can you just wake up one day and decide to create magic. I want to learn how to do those. Any advice is appreciated.

Seems like kind of strange / yet somewhat appropriate choice since Forth \"traditionally use neither operating system nor file system.\" and \"A full-featured Forth system with all source code will compile itself\".  Bootstrap your own operating system on a computer with literally nothing. Interesting to read about though as a tangent, very different kind of language.  \"grammar has no official specification\"  \"looks the word up in the dictionary\" and then does whatever the dictionary specifies. Good luck on the project though, seems like it fell out of use in the 80's and only got recovered recently.  The Forth Interest Group comments on the subject are funny too. [1]  \"What ANS Forths are available?\" -> \"The simple answer is: none\"  Apparently somebody (Vincent Hamp) got it to work on Thumb-2 ISA (ARMv7-M and newer) though.  Tiny.  7kb flash, 320B of ram.

          "text": "The primary virtue of a Forth system is that it is interactive.  You can see this on any 1990s system that can start up in Open Firmware. I've started with a FIG-Forth kernel in 9900 assembler, which fits into 8K.  Many authors worked that code up to the 1990s branch I grabbed. To bring up the board, I cross-assemble to produce two Flash EEPROMs, plug them in, and power up.  The Forth kernel looks at block 6 for customizations where I tell it to compile some source packages I want from Flash.  One of these is -ASSEMBLER, which lets me create short chunks of native machine code to work on very low-level things like bit I/O, the SPI and I2C peripheral behavior.  Very good for debugging initial hardware. When I'm happy with some code, I add the source to the next EEPROM build. Block numbers were originally 1K chunks of disk, but can refer to any kind of storage like pages of ROM/RAM, or even to a process' virtual address space. reply",

          "text": "Similar experience w/ my daughter (now 12 y/o) here. We read the heck out of children's books when she was little. There were nights when I really didn't want to slog thru the same Suzy Spafford[6] book again, but I did it anyway. I think it paid off. My daughter is an avid reader now. She says she still wants me to read to her, so I do. This year was a bit sci-fi heavy, and we've decided to target more fantasy and literature in 2026. This year's books included: \"Below the Root\", \"And All Between\", and \"Until the Celebration\" - The \"Green Sky Trilogy\"[0] by Zilpha Keatly Snyder. We held off on playing the \"Below the Root\" video game[1] but I'm hoping that as we get into winter weather and outside time becomes more scarce we can get to it. It's arguably the final book in the \"trilogy\". \"Redshirts\"[2] by John Scalzi. We've been slowly making our way through Star Trek TOS in the last couple years so. That gave her enough cultural fluency with the tropes in the book to make it effective. \"To Say Nothing of the Dog\"[3] by Connie Willis. My daughter adores Victorian England and comedy. This book also turned her on to Jerome K. Jerome's \"Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog)\"[4] (which I'm still working thru on my own-- I do not particularly love Victorian England but it is a good book). Besides the books I read to my daughter, I also read Martha Wells' \"The Murderbot Diaries\"[5] series myself. I'm vaguely interested in the television adaptation. I'd love to hear what somebody who has read the series thinks of the TV version.

It felt like it was made for fans (the portrayal of the embedded show, Sanctuary Moon, was wonderful and I felt like whoever did their hairstyles had an immense amount of fun), yet accessible without knowing the story. Murderbot’s self-narration was good; I wanted more since it drove so much of the book but what was there in the show carried its personality well. Alexander Skarsgard pulled the character off well. My mental picture of Murderbot from the books was very different but now when I re-read the first book after watching the show, I heard his voice. I still feel slightly sad they didn’t get a more genderless or gender-ambivalent actor (he looks male, the bot was agender before the show) or tried to portray him differently… they could have reduced this but the way they filmed him assigns gender to an ungendered character. The other actors were all excellent too. I felt far more of a sense of them as a team and individuals than I remember from the first book. If you enjoyed the books I think you’ll enjoy the show, except for me that it has changed my picture of Murderbot and I am not sure for the better, in terms of what I felt were social / identity values the books encouraged. reply",

The narration seemed incredibly challenging (and kept making me think of \"A Christmas Story\", of all things). The integration of \"Sanctuary Moon\" sounds particularly fun. I definitely see Murderbot as genderless and seeing it as gendered is going to be weird. Fortunately, the series isn't particularly \"dear\" to me and I think I can deal with the trauma of having my mental pictures wiped-out by somebody else's. (There are properties like \"Neuromancer\" and \"Snow Crash\" that I hope are never adapted to video and, if they are, I will steadfastly refuse to ever see, because I can't imagine anybody else's mental pictures will be better than mine...) reply",

I've never seen \"A Christmas Story\" (Wikipedia shows it as very American-cultural-icon) but reading the synopsis, I'm surprised how many parts of it are semi-familiar, perhaps culturally reflected in other ways.

          "text": "Technical followed by non-technical. I read more than these, but these are the highlights. Mouse, a Language for Microcomputers by Peter Grogono - Mouse is basically an esolang with barely any abstraction facilities, but the book was well-written and the language compelling enough to explore further. Notes on Distance Dialing (pdf) by AT&T - Described the telephone systems of the USA and Canada in the mid-1950s. The reading is a dry as it gets, but it was a fascinating dive into a vastly complex system solving extremely hard problems. This is a must-read for folks interested in systems-thinking. That said, I am actively looking for recommendations for books about the process of designing and building the unbelievably complex telephony system over the rudiments of the earlier systems. Recommendations welcomed! The Eye of Osiris by R. Austin Freeman - This is the first book that I’ve read from Freeman and I suspect that I will read many more in the future. The story follows the disappearance of John Bellingham, Egyptologist and the subsequent investigation. As the investigation stalls, the eminent Dr. Thorndyke digs into the case. The story sets up the mystery nicely and indeed provides enough information to the reader to infer how the disappearance occurred and who or what facilitated it. The book is one of the best whodunits that I’ve ever read. The Mystery of Edwin Drood by Charles Dickens - His final work remains unfinished as he passed away before he could complete it. Further complicating the meta-story is that he also didn’t outline the ending nor even put to paper the “villain” of the story. The meta-mystery of the ending has motivated a mountain of speculation around the ending including dozens of continuations of the story from other authors, all deriving their pet endings from textual hints, accounts from Dickens’ friends, illustration notes, and even in some cases seances supposedly accompanied by the spirit of Dickens himself. What was written by Dickens is spectacular and a compelling mystery and although it would be great to know the resolution, in some ways the “Droodiana” that has cropped up over the past 150+ years is reason enough for it to remain a mystery. The whole lore around Edwin Drood is a worthwhile hobby in itself and well-worth exploring. The Chiltern Library edition of the book contains the story and a good bit of the lore around the writing and the meta-works available at the time of its publication. The Shadow People by Margaret St. Clair - Sadly out of print and difficult to find, but I’ve had it on my shelves for decades and finally got around to reading it. The book came onto my radar in the 1980s when I learned about it in the appendix-n of the 1st edition Advanced D&D Dungeon Masters Guide. I enjoyed many of the books at the time and have slowly swung around to re-reading them over the past few years. Sadly, most on the list do not stand the test of time for me, but St. Clair’s mixture of 60s counter-cultural leanings in a fantasy/sf world still works. The cultural touch-points in the book feel quite dated, but despite the occasional awkwardness, the story is unique even today. Lolly Willowes by Sylvia Townsend Warner - The book started as a passable novel of manners focused on a turn of the century British middle-class family. The titular character was mostly background decoration for the first third of the novel and AFAIR was talked about only in the third-person. It’s only when she made the choice to move out on her own to the country in her middle age does she gain a central role in the narrative and her inner thoughts revealed. This is where things really pick up because I was shocked to learn that this unassuming woman’s inner thoughts had a delicious darkness to them. I don’t want to give away too much, but I’ll just say that you will not expect how the story ends. Patience by Daniel Clowes - A profound graphic novel using time-travel to explore the idea of enduring love with a story that proceed through time, following Jack as he tries to alter the past and save the woman he loves. This well-known science fiction motif is elevated by Clowes’ signature psychological complexity. Narcissus and Goldmund by Herman Hesse - I’ve read most of the books by Hermann Hesse but this one escaped my attention until this year. The story follows the parallel lives of a monk Narcissus and his passionate friend Goldmund as they respectively search for meaning in life through spiritual means and through pleasures of the flesh. We Who Are About To… by Joanna Russ - A small group of astronauts crash land on a hostile alien world and quickly realize that rescue is unlikely to come. Many SF stories have started this way and so the expectation is that this is a colonization story… but Russ thrives on subverting reader expectations. Fifty Forgotten Records by R.B. Russell - Another lovely entry in Russell’s series (one can hope) of autobiographical explorations of art, so far covering literature and now music. This book describes 50 records of varying popularity and Russell’s personal connections to each. While I certainly enjoyed finding a dozen or so new albums to explore, the true triumph of the book lies in the vulnerable, reflective memoir threaded throughout. The Way of All Flesh by Samuel Butler A novel that follows 4-generations of the Ponitifex family, with a particular bildungsroman-esque thread around Ernest, a young man who’s naivete leads to his downfall and how his life unfolds thereafter.

          "text": "Sci-fi nerd recommendations follow. I binged the entirety of the Dungeon Crawler Carl series. The cover, & the fact that it was on Kindle Unlimited, made me think it was probably cheap crap, but I was impressed with how well-written it was, and how much I empathized with the characters. (I probably should have read it slower; by the last two books, I was just flowing with the text, not paying as much attention to the overarching plot.) Heinlein's \"Orphans of the Sky\" was pretty bad. So much early scifi is considered great because it's groundbreaking, writing about things nobody else has before. The concept of a generation ship was pretty new at the time Heinlein was writing it, and it has some very interesting concepts, but the book has some really bad problems . If you've read it, you know; if you haven't, and decide to, you'll see it for yourself. I binged a few Brandon Sanderson books. The standalones are great; the Stormlight Archive is a huge slog through some beautiful writing, but I'm not sure I'm willing to spend so much time in beautiful books that move the plot forward so slowly. Exordia, by Seth Dickinson, started off incredible, kept going, but the ending felt like both a fizzle as well as a cliff-hanger for the next book. I'm glad I read it, but I wish it had a clear conclusion it wanted to reach. Adrian Tchaikovsky's \"Children of Memory\" delivers more of the great philosophical questions & answers about the nature of consciousness and personhood that the previous books did, A+. No idea where he could possibly go from there, but if he does, I'm going along for the journey. (Honorable mention: Alien Clay. Dishonorable mention: Service Model.) Eric Flint's \"Fenrir\" was a fun BDO near-future space adventure. (As was John Sanford's Saturn Run, but that wasn't a 2025 book I read.) reply",

You can now read lots of those stories on-line (like at https://www.freesfonline.net/Magazines2.html ).  Some of them have stood the test of time, but some are really really bad.  John Campbell, the editor of Analog back then, was racist, and also convinced that smoking tobacco was a Good Thing.  Many of the stories were written (by others) to convey those ideas; it's almost unusual for lead characters not to light up a cigarette. It will be interesting to see how much of today's scifi holds up half a century from now---not because the science is wrong, but because the moral qualities will be judged outlandish. reply",

          "text": "I'm not influential enough but I'll share the recommendations I think will help people like me: struggling parents. This year I've reread The Discontented Little Baby Book. If you're getting/have a newborn, this is the book I'd read. It's humane. No sleep training, no nonsense about babies. We went full ‘possum’ with our baby and I like how happy he became. I've also read Ten Things I Wish You Knew About Your Child's Mental Health. To me this could be an instant classic. No fluff, lots of advice for parents. Prima. There's plenty of literature on parenting, but so much of it is poorly written or poorly researched. Be careful out there. (And don't read PLS, yikes.) --- I finally discovered Andy Weir, the Thursday Next series, and The 13.5 Lives of Captain Bluebear. I'm amazed it took me so long to get there. All excellent. For some reason I decided to read all 7 Harry Potters in French. If you're learning French, it's a great idea, the French gets progressively harder so you can keep up! Bryson's At Home: A Short History of Private Life has been my companion for some weeks, but it's quite long. I'm happy with all my reading this year, some 32 books, many in a foreign language. Given I've no time to read during the day, and can only get some pages in after the kid's in bed, it's not too shabby. Oh, and we've read Stompysaurus, like, 90 times? Grawwwwr!

Here's some quotes to give you a feel: \"The smartphone is the electrical stunner in the slaughterhouse of society\" \"You’ll be able to access any TV or radio station in real time, around the world, talk to people overseas in high resolution video with live translations for free and be bored by it\" \"In the future the hermetic spaces of solitude will be breached as we build a global village. The private will become public and, ironically, the public will become private as the streets empty of experiences taken indoors, inside of bedrooms, beneath our screens of glowing grace.\" It's intentionally meant to be ambitious, brutal and challenging.

Here's my log for 2025, most recent at the top. Currently I am slogging my way through Heinlein's \"The Number of the Beast\" which I'm not a fan of. Halfway done with it though! Gabrielle Zevin, \"The Hole We're In\" (not my usual genre, enjoyed this though) Robert A. Heinlein, \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" (pretty good) Robert A. Heinlein, \"Time Enough for Love\" (PHENOMENAL, highly recommended) Robert A. Heinlein, \"Methuselah's Children\" (pretty good, required to understand \"Time Enough for Love\") Richard K. Morgan, \"Altered Carbon\" (very good) Robert A. Heinlein, \"The Rolling Stones\" (young adult, but good all the same) Robert A. Heinlein, \"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\" (very good) Piers Anthony, \"On A Pale Horse\" (very good, never got very far into the series though) Lincoln Child, \"Full Wolf Moon\" (okay, not great) Lincoln Child, \"The Forgotten Room\" (pretty good) Lincoln Child, \"The Third Gate\" (very good) Lincoln Child, \"Terminal Freeze\" (okay, not great) William Gibson, \"In the Beginning… Was the Command Line\" (good, but outdated, look up what he's said about it more recently) Lincoln Child, \"Deep Storm\" (very good) James Patterson, \"Along Came a Spider\" (not my usual genre, okay though) Jules Verne, \"Around the World in 80 Days\" (from childhood, revisited) reply",

Kindle app syncs between devices, and makes it easier to read a few pages here and there instead of waiting for uninterrupted sessions with my Kindle. 3. Continually updating a To Read list, mostly by going to Barnes and Noble, taking pictures of featured book tables, then adding the interesting ones to my Libby hold list. 4. Borrowing with Libby makes it easier to bail out of a book that doesn't intrigue me. Instead of forcing myself to finish something I spent $ on, I can just return it and move onto something else, feeling 0 guilt. reply",

          "text": "My reading is largely split between Sci-Fi and Australian crime fiction. So far this year I consumed 16 audiobooks and 68 ebooks. Given the Oz fiction would be a bit more unique to this audience, here are the highlights: The Fall Between and Burning Mountain by Darcy Tindale recount the investigations of main character Rebecca Giles. The Survivors by Jane Harper. Seriously, get any book or a shopping list written by Jane and you'll not be able to put it down. Mad Mabel by Sally Hepworth. Another author who's complete catalogue is well worth your time. Black River and Broke Road by Matthew Spencer. Unbury the Dead by Fiona Hardy. Other authors worth noting are Margaret Hickey, Chris Hammer and Christian White. On the sci-fi side of things, I found Infinite Archive by Mur Lafferty quite cozy. Also the Lady Astronauth Universe series by Mary Robinette Kowal, that starts with The Calculating Starts . Flybot by Dennis Taylor (of Bobbi-verse fame). I was less enamoured with A Memory Called Empire by Arkady Martine than others are, and don't feel the need to tackle the second in the series. I also revisited the John Cleaver horror series by Dan Wells that starts with the excellent I Am Not a Serial Killer . I've just started Slow Gods by Claire North. I find her books a bit hit and miss for me but so far, so good. I absolutely love The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August , and Touch was also quite good, but some of her others I could not finish or didn't event start as they were just not for me. reply",

          "text": "My top book of the year: Fryderyk Chopin: A Life and Times , Alan Walker A riveting read by a legendary musicologist and biographer.  Walker spent about ten years researching this.  It is 700 pages, which seems daunting but he makes this authoritative bio absolutely enjoyable.  It's also a \"corrective biography\", it dispels a lot of myths.  This book is one of the best examples of accessible writing with flair.  What a writer! Throughout the book, Walker tastefully quotes musical phrases (in notation) from Chopin's works to situate them in context.  I often paused reading and put on the track on a given page (nocturnes, mazurkas, preludes, etc).  It made the reading experience incredibly rich and fun.  Other things I enjoyed: Chopin's letters to his friends and family, life in aristocratic salons of Paris, London, Warsaw, and more—Chopin had unparalleled access.  Of course, there's also a lot of gut-wrenching stuff.  As the book's blurb says, it really is for both the casual music lover and the professional pianist. If you haven't discovered them yet, give a listen to Chopin's nocturnes.  But please, give them an attentive listen and play them on a high-quality audio system.  Here[1] is one of his finest nocturnes (it is less famous than the \"happier\" nocturne that follows it, Op. 9 No. 2).

          "text": "\"Brief Cases\" -- just give me more Dresden. I think my favourite series, I'm a simple guy :) Short stories themself are so and so. If you are into the series then these small stories are just like Saturday evening reading, so no big investment. Some of them stick and make you warm, some of them meh, thats ok. \"Mother of Learning\" I picked up from my (ex-)colleague. Not in the time-travelling, but he told me that I would probably like Dungeon Crawler Carl. Haven't gotten to it yet. He's read more fantasy than me so he just suggested after we discussed about our preferences. This one I just wanted to read because he really was into :) About Fitz -- read my other comment. I think whole Elderling series is worth it. It is the long game. Just being invested in characters and Robin Hobb can write characters. If you only think about Farseer trilogy, then I still think it's worth it, but maybe I'm just sucker for it. :-) (there are pacing issues for sure, but Hobb wrote it in 90s, in that sense it was ahead of time, forgive some of those small issues). Read it first I guess 20+ years ago or so.. reply",

That type of content drives brand and product hype via views/engagement, helps you filter ideas (if your vlog is getting no traction, maybe not a great product?) and avoids promotional post rules in a lot of communities. My new years resolution is to dial in my content driven development pipeline. reply",

Devs have very good BS radar and \"hype\" is sometimes all there is in a lot of content. I see and hear a lot of the \"build in public\" being promoted as the way to do things with the \"build an audience\" mantra. There is a huge hurdle to produce good video content, it takes a lot of time to record, edit and publish quality videos. Publishing quality videos can help get traction/views/subscribers but that doesn't mean it will translate into paying customers either. Do people really want to watch software developers code or talk about it? There has to be other ways to market a product. reply",

          "text": "There are some hacks to make video content easier: 1. Just do split screen videos where you talking head with slides on the other, and read off the slides. 2. Record in segments, with a full reset between each segment. Makes editing really fast. 3. Don't stress about small mistakes. People are into authenticity, it's ok. Lighting/\"studio\" design is still an art, but you can get something set up in a day or two. The harder part is coming up with good video ideas, and doing a compelling title/thumbnail/hook. That's a rabbit hole. If you have a social media following you can leverage that. Cold calls can work if you're selling big ticket items, but you also need to be good at sales and do a lot of legwork so I wouldn't go down that route. I wouldn't start advertising until you can demonstrate product market fit. reply",

I'm not the target audience clearly, but this seems like a mechanical, low sophistication task, why don't I just use gemini or whatever to do this for free? If I already pay $20/month for any LLM that's multi modal I can do this now already. The asset (animated doodles) doesn't really connect me to how I'm going to get a better click through rate.

Not quite an oxymoron but certainly a puzzlement. Maybe, generously, in retrospect, an aspiration? I never considered myself an actual engineer; I was (and still am) a self-taught un-credentialed computer programmer. More art than science. They made me take the title and the stock options and the business cards. I mostly worked for and with EEs, making software tools for test automation. I was a fanboy hardware wannabee (and still am), got some on me but was never a true engineer. I learned from those who practiced their discipline; it was plain to me the reality of real engineering versus what I was doing. I suppose in my travels I have on occasion encountered a true Software Engineer. I suppose there's reason to hope that software development will continue to mature and evolve, and eventually the other engineering disciplines will accept software as a science. For me, it will always be a joy to make that hardware work with my twiddly bits. Not engineering, no. But very rewarding work that often resembles engineering. reply",

          "text": "Funny you should mention this, I just added a simple filesystem sandbox to my coding agent. Check it out: https://github.com/jacobsparts/agentlib/blob/main/src/agentl... The framework is all python, but I used C for this helper.  It uses unprivileged user namespaces to mount an overlay and run an arbitrary command, then when the command finishes, it writes a tarball of edits, which I use to create a unified diff.  The framework orchestrates it all transparently, but the helper itself could be used standalone.  Here's a short document about the sandbox in the context of it's use in my project: https://github.com/jacobsparts/agentlib/blob/main/docs/sandb... I also have a version that uses SUID instead of unprivileged user namespaces, available by request. I often use claude code with --dangerously-skip-permissions but every once in a while it bites me.  I've learned to use git for everything and put instructions to always commit BEFORE writes in CLAUDE.md.  Claude can go off the rails on harder bug fixes, especially if there are multiple rounds of context compacting, it can really screw things up.  It usually honors guidance not to modify outside of the project, but a simple sandbox adds so much, after the session is over you can see what changed and decide what to do with it.  It really helps with the problem where it makes unexpected changes to the codebase, which you might not even notice otherwise, which can introduce serious bugs.  The permission models of all the coding agents are rough--either you can't get anything done, or you throw caution to the wind.  Full sandboxes are quite restrictive, which is why I rolled by own.  Honestly your best option right now is just to have good version control and run coding agents in dedicated environments. reply",

It's a 2 player jumping game where you collect stars and bounce off clouds to rack up the highest score before time runs out. Players manage an energy bar to jump, land on clouds for super bounces, and you can throw bombs at each other to steal points and cause chaos. Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no dependencies, ~1000 lines in a single file. The kids designed the characters (Kirby and Kee Kee) and we had a blast playtesting together... tweaking cloud bounce physics, adding a tie screen for when scores match, bumping bombs from 3 to 5. Kid-driven game design is so much fun. Try it here: https://kirby-sky-jumpers.mfelixstudio.workers.dev Controls: WASD + L-Shift (P1) / Arrows + R-Shift (P2) Please give us some feedback on how to improve! reply",

So if you were going to build a competitor, you'd need to get everyone who has built a profile on linkedin and built a 20 year rolodex of their network to all migrate away. I'm not saying it cannot happen, I'm saying it is not a tech problem, so building a new flavor of the same app and hoping it wins out is an even higher-risk bet than most startups, and therefore does not fall into most people's risk tolerances. reply",

You can (and should!) ignore it and not miss out on anything. Make a profile. Update it occasionally when you're job searching. Forget about the site until you need it. Hit the unsubscribe button when they e-mail you suggestions. The exception is people who simply cannot resist getting pulled into a feed and scrolling it. If that's you, I understand why you'd stay off of the website. For everyone else, it's a set it and forget it until you need it kind of website. That's also why a second website isn't appealing to anyone. They've already gotten past the set-and-forget part.

Once enough people join, we can launch our own open feed that connects directly to the people you follow. No need for the big platforms at all. You pull updates straight from their sites in real time and move freely without losing your content or your audience. It reuses the network effects we already have while giving you true ownership and independence.

You're right that it's used differently for finding candidates, but I still don't engage with the feed. At most I've posted that I have a job opening as a post (not a job listing). The problem is that it's heavily biased toward people who spend a lot of time on LinkedIn scrolling the feed, which in my experience isn't the most positive signal for people you want to hire to focus on your work. Similar story for hiring people who spend all day posting on any social media: They tend to be distracted by their social media fixation and it's hard to keep them focused on work communications instead of their current online argument. reply",

It's deadlock, for every thread you care about.  (2) Automation in job applications and a declining job market have both made networking more essential, so there's no tolerance for lost connections, so you'd also have to solve those problems too before all would switch.  (3)  Even if users don't like it and could surmount the coordination costs of switching, if companies continue to rely on it, switching would be a career-limiting move; and because companies cannot signal their recruitment strategies without triggering a stampede to game their system, companies tend to keep quiet, so no company would lead an exodus. Still, no one (outside influencers) likes how work networking and recruitment happens today, so user might do both linkedin and some new system if one created a more effective networking and recruitment mode (e.g., for some well-defined, high-value subset, like recent Stanford MBA's, YC alumni, FinTech, ...). reply",

So once LinkedIn stops providing the value that gives it its dominance, and/or someone finds a way to deliver more value, you'll see your competition. That's your answer. Seemingly nobody has found a good enough angle or opportunity, And FWIW, sure the network effect is hard to replace, but not even close to impossible. Just ask the dozens of other social networks that have fallen from greatness.

There is no need for a contender because Linkedin is a poorly thought solution to an ill addressed problem.

          "text": "Why is there strong competition for every other social media site? This seems to come down to a few market dynamics:\n1. The major influencers who adopt it and bring their followers\n2. New networks bring new leaderboards which attract the next generation that has zero equity on the existing sites\n3. Regular engagement is critical, otherwise every network faces a death spiral\n4. Engagement required to drive ad revenue LinkedIn is notable for not being affected by these:\n1. There are no major influencers (though they tried.) The most influential person on LinkedIn is very close in value to the median software engineer\n2. There are no significant leaderboards (though they tried.) Few people care how many followers others have\n3. Regular engagement doesn't matter, because it is still the Schelling point for irregular life events (ie needing a job.) \n4. Most of their revenue comes from subscriptions for recruiters, so the lower engagement is not an existential crisis. LinkedIn is an always-on jobs expo pretending to be social media. Even the executives think they are social media. They are actually something else. Some angles to compete:\n1. Build better data for an underserved segment. Obvious choice is SWE, but MSFT owns Github as a firewall here. Another candidate is the top 1% of executives: they might be the major influencers that haven't been activated yet.\n2. Build an identity layer that mitigates risk of fake job seekers. LinkedIn has halfheartedly tried this but their inertia might be an opportunity.\n3. Build the Github for other segments: the verifiable portfolios that show real work. \n4. Build a frontrunner to the hiring pipeline. If every star candidate can be identified three months before they start looking on LinkedIn, the recruiting system there will fall apart. \n5. Build the workplace social media network that users actually want to use daily. LinkedIn failed at this, and their effort indicates they see the risk of disruption coming from here. Some existing companies that are on the right track:\n1. Slack. Already owns DAU for work, well-funded, competes with MSFT in many domains. 30% confident they've considered moving into this space, but Benioff getting AI-pilled will slow it down.\n2. Behance. Owned the market for designers, sold to Adobe, game over.\n2. Glassdoor. Useful data that LinkedIn doesn't own, but they seem to have embraced the Yelp business model instead.\n3. Fishbowl. Daily engagement solved but they've backed into a local maxima.\n4. Upwork. Stuck with low-end brand that will prevent them from winning this market.\n5. X. Has all the pieces except for a leader who cares about a jobs board. Would need a certain kind of leader for their jobs product to get it to win.\n6. Every other talent startup: fighting for the right revenue, but they almost always approach it from the transactional staffing model or the ATS subscription model. Would need someone to buy all of them up and launch a network with 100M profiles on day one. reply",

          "text": "Not a bug but rather an engineering oversight. Also not hard and it did not affect me, I caught it soon, but it was one of those surprising moments worth mentioning. I have a write-online table in MariaDB and ordering of records is important. I have realised that the database has no such thing as append-only table that stores records in the order they are submitted into the database. Every record has one or more indices, and it is these indices that dictate the ordering and only for the data they index. What I have overlooked is when a transaction A starts, then transaction B starts, the transaction A might have records with smaller keys, as it started sooner, but transaction B commits first with higher keys, which means I end up with out-of-order entries. This is not too bad, actually, it depends on the context and in my case the context was that there were readers constantly waiting for new records. And so if a reader reads records after transaction B commits but not before transaction A commits, the reader will never see new records from transaction A. I have solved it by blocking the readers based on number of active transactions with ordering being considered. I have wrote about it in this blog post, in the \"Event Log and proper ordering of events\" section https://gethly.com/blog/how-of-gethly/event-sourcing-right-w... reply",

          "text": "Not exactly a bug, but I was given a company written video player that receives a video stream, decodes it via the browser WebCodecs API, and renders via WebGL. Users complained that video was laggy and often froze on their iPhones. My task was to make it perform better - using the browser's built-in player wasn't an option. After profiling, I found two bottlenecks: converting frames to RGB was happening on the CPU and was quite costly, so I rendered the decoded YUV frames directly on the GPU without conversion. Second, I moved all logic off the main thread since our heavy UI was competing for the same resources. The main thread thing was that I was iterating through the frame buffer multiple times per second to select the appropriate frame for rendering. When heavy UI animations occurred, the main thread would block, causing the iteration to complete late - by then, the target frame's timestamp had passed, so it would get skipped and only the next frame would be drawn, creating visible stuttering. reply",

          "text": "Muslim majority country here (Malaysia). Christmas day is a public holiday, and so is New Year's. It's also the end of the year when most people want to use up their paid time off. Nobody likes having a holiday on two Thursdays followed by work on Friday. Nor do we want to encourage people to carry vacation days to the next year. So we're happy to take the bulk time off at least, and it gives time for people to arrange school paperwork. It is technically a sin in Islam to celebrate other religious holidays. Heck, if you want to go deep into the dogma, everything besides the two Eids shouldn't be celebrated and that includes Prophet Muhammad's birthday and New Year's. But you'll see very heated debates about this that I won't go into. Christmas lies in a weird place on this spectrum. Some say Abrahamic holidays are fine, some say most 'Islamic' holidays are blasphemy. People argue about the Santa hats too. However, Christmas food is perfectly halal. Turkey, peppermint, non-alcoholic egg nog, various desserts. You'll see \"end of year\" dinners by Muslim restaurants that cater to this. Culturally, many of us do have Christian family and friends. So it is a convenient time to meet family and just have an excuse to cook complex Western dishes once a year. Gift giving is rare. You'll see secret Santa stuff at the workplace and in schools. 90% of people in the region do not have disposable income, so expensive gifts are frowned on, as they create pressure. Most are under $25, like fancy soap, snacks, chocolate, a power bank. There's also a culture where charity should be hidden, so stuff usually gets put in a box with no names and the boxes are pseudorandomly distributed. reply",

          "text": "I was a little steamed when my son came home from school with a pamphlet about winter festivals which listed all of them except for the astronomically correct one that us pagans celebrate. On the other hand, the Christian (apocryphal) idea that hope came into the world on the (almost) darkest day of the year is beautiful to me.  As well as the idea that some ancient Hebrews miraculously survived in a cave. I also like the idea that the celebrations start with advent like they do in Germany or that there are “12 days of Christmas” ending with the epiphany,  which is a real astronomical event which is part of the explanation of why Christians celebrate the day that they do.

Yes, I know slaves must be set free after seven years. That doesn’t suddenly make it okay and it’s painful to watch people use that as a justification. > technological achievements of the last centuries Christians love to claim these advancements for themselves as long as it fits their story. Much of our mathematical advancements come from the Muslim world. And plenty of scientists that changed the world were under prosecution of Christianity. But it is convenient that a doctor (who has spent years learning about the human body) can remove your bad gallbladder then attributing it to your god. Unless you’re a type of Christian that doesn’t believe in surgery, then it’s “of the devil”. > without risk of being scalped alive? Well, as long as you’re not a Palestinian trying to survive a genocide that is in part supported by fundamentalist Christians on the other side of the planet. Frankly, your comment reeks of “white Jesus saved the world” or what many might refer to as racism. Your example of scalping really, really gives you away. reply",

          "text": "Christma$$ is so very commercial. Jesus’ message is universally ignored, based on actions, and in fact the entire world economy is based on the seven deadly sins. [0] You wouldn’t want people to destroy the world economy by being devout, would you? Pride, Greed, Envy, Lust, Anger, Gluttony, Laziness. \nFrom the cited article: > Pride. Pride is the will to omnipotence. It’s the greatest of sins, and yet it’s everywhere: big business and the elites impose their rules on the world, new technologies are increasingly transgressive (AI, transhumanism, space conquest, etc.), skyscrapers are being built ever taller, etc. In one way or another, the biggest companies reflect this pride. > Greed. Greed is the excessive attachment to money, and the contemporary economy is based on the constant quest for profit. The accumulation of wealth, tax havens and excessive speculation are all modern forms of greed. > Envy. Envy is a deep-seated vice: it means wanting what someone else has. These days, marketing and advertising constantly make us dream of other people’s lives, in a competition where everyone tries to compare themselves, without ever being satisfied with what they are and what they have. In particular, social networking platforms … > Anger.  But the modern economy, by creating the best and the worst, generates inhuman inequalities that arouse anger in everyone. > Lust. Lust is the immoderate pursuit of sexual desire. The MindGeek company, which brings together the major platforms of the pornographic industry, including YouPorn, Pornhub, etc., is enjoying worldwide success. > Gluttony. Gluttony, as we all know, is not a passing fancy. It’s a compulsive need for food pleasure. As the modern economy constantly pushes us to consume, it also pushes those who can afford it to eat non-stop… > Laziness. Finally, laziness is not just weariness. It is the refusal of physical, moral and intellectual effort. There you go. We are creating tools that even think for us. So, only a few among us actually believe in the child’s message, and behave accordingly, (actions count, really they do) or at least try to. :-) [0] https://julienchevalier.com/en/the-economy-of-the-7-deadly-s... reply",

          "text": "If you follow HN over the course of 24 hours, you’ll see at least 3 major waves. I tend to have an odd sleep schedule, so I’m always amused when I’m online to see which group is currently active. There is an Asian/Australian wave, followed by Europe, and the North America. Some of the best times are when the waves start to mix (ex: early morning NYC time, you’ll get the Europe and NA groups interacting). You’ll see different types of stories posted. Similar enough to where it all makes sense to be on HN, but it seems like a different flavor. But the comments are where I start to see more differences. You can get new takes on the same article if you see the comments from different times of the day. This doesn’t take into account the total numbers of people active from each region, which I suspect is skewed towards more users the US coasts. But, it does, I think, speak to how US centric HN is. I think it serves the needs each of the waves in a distinct way. In many ways, this is just an extension of the weekend HN effect. You can clearly observe differences on the site over the weekends. So, to me, it is unsurprising that you’d find differences across time zones. I’d love to actually see this analyzed more. This is just the take from someone who has been awake at enough hours to observe some anecdotal trends. reply",

Today, it happened to my family.<p>My mother received a call from a scammer. They told her she needed to process some tax issue and prove that her bank account had enough money. In just a few minutes, they tricked her and manipulated her into entering banking OTP codes. All of her savings are now gone.<p>What makes this more dramatic is that last year I architected and helped a government department in my country build a big system. This system can track money flows across the whole country, to know where money comes from. I was very proud of this. It is the biggest achievement of my life. Even if nobody knows I built it, that was fine.<p>But now I cannot protect my own mother. I cannot protect my family. My system can track the money, but it is almost impossible to get it back.<p>When I went to the police, just in one small area, there were more than 20 cases in a single day. A hardworking student sent all their family's money, thinking it was for university fees or going abroad. An old factory worker lost all her retirement savings. So many people lost everything. That is when I realized that the system I built, the system I was proud of, is not enough.<p>All my own savings are gone too. (My mother was scammed into borrowing a lot of money and sending it to the scammers, and now it is my responsibility.) I had plans for the next few years: to do open source work, to write books about math and programming, to create a dream Go web framework, to give back to the community. Now all of that is gone.<p>But this is not only about me. I can still start over. I am strong enough to rebuild my life. But who will protect people like my mother? Or a poor student? Or a factory worker? Or so many others?<p>I can build systems. I can build distributed systems that scale to a whole country. But for what? What should I do?<p>I have been reading Hacker News for 12 to 13 years, sometimes posting from other accounts. I am writing here now to ask for advice and help from this community.<p>If anyone has experience with similar cases, or ideas on what can realistically be done, or even advice on how to move forward after something like this, I would really appreciate it. I will keep this account semi-private, because with the details above, I think some engineers from my country may recognize me.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

They can even trick a person into selling expensive property (real estate) and then steal the money. One thing is the government must act. These calls are mostly done from abroad. Phone companies can implement some protective measures. Banks too need to watch for common patterns (doesn't always help because scammers talk the victim around the checks). The society as a whole needs to get aware. What a single person could do is to keep contact with the relatives. I've read an expert report on one such case; the author wrote that even a single close someone could break the trance and stop the scam. In that case the victim happened to be a popular singer seemingly never alone, yet as it turned out she actually was a lone old lady with not a single confidant close enough for more than a month. She was, of course, shattered with what happened (she lost close to $3M), but after some time in one if her interviews she said: \"I will survive\". She said it in Russian and did not comment on the phrase further, it must be too personal. Yet of course she meant that song. The song helps her. The song's story is different, but the emotion is same. We have all our love to give. A hard hit will do good if it makes us to commit on that. reply",

Literally her defenses were \"the buyer should've known this deal was suspect due to below the market price\" and that the buyer should have asked for a health report from a psychiatrist (wtf). Not a nice old lady after all. I haven't been following the case closely, but it seems like the decision has been overturned. Similar to Streisand Effect, there's now in Russia the term Dolina Effect [0] after this singer, referring to these \"grandma schemes\" where criminals direct the elderly to sell their property and then renege, relying on courts siding with them to keep the property and the money. Whatever the real story is, it's all so messed up. [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolina_effect reply",

The person on the screen can look and sound real. The conversation feels natural and authoritative. For many people, especially older relatives, it is almost impossible to tell that it is fake. This is no longer about obvious scam messages or bad phone calls. AI is making scams feel personal and trustworthy. Please warn your families. No bank or authority will ever ask for OTP codes or urgent transfers, even if it is a video call and the person looks real. reply",

          "text": "Sorry to hear this. From where I am (India), there’s hardly anything that you can do because it’s likely that the ones with power won’t do anything. As an individual, you can only focus on yourself and those you know and try to educate them as much as is possible. These kind of scams have become a huge problem in India (look up “digital arrest” scams). People of all backgrounds and age groups have lost a lot of money (to put it in US dollar equivalent amounts, imagine a person losing few hundred thousand dollars to a couple of million dollars). There is nothing like “digital arrest” in Indian laws. The government has tried to warn people about this. The larger problem seems to be a combination of factors across disinterested entities: 1. The police aren’t interested in solving these (there’s a separate division for cybercrime). Filing a formal report is usually thwarted and avoided by the police. Even if they show some interest, it always involves paying them fat sums of money. There’s no guarantee that they can recover the money. 2. The banks aren’t interested in solving this. It seems like specific bank branch managers are involved and just stand by allowing large transactions (like cash withdrawals) to just be approved without raising any questions or concerns. All the talk by banks about “risk management” (alongside compliance matters) goes out the window just for the victims of these scams. 3. With SMS OTPs being common and the scammers recruiting some locals to run SIM farms/phone farms, the telecom companies aren’t interested in solving issues within themselves either. Though there is a limit of nine phone numbers (total) per person in India, and though there is on paper a KYC process (including a live video) to get a phone number, the telecom companies have systems and employees who can provide numerous numbers based on stolen or fake IDs. 4. The government is a bystander and appears helpless. Instead of creating laws and enforcing existing laws, it focuses on some awareness that these scams are not genuine. 5. The Supreme Court finally ordered CBI (the Indian equivalent of FBI) to investigate these scams. So there you have it: none of the entities involved has any interest or will to do something about the problem. There will always be excuses that the scammers are in another country. reply",

The best thing you can do is help to educate people, maybe create an organization that can work with other organizations to target youth and senior knowledge.  Before they passed both my grandmothers had seen many similar scam efforts that targeted them.  One of my grandmothers was way too knowledgeable and crafty to fall for it, even pleas like, \"Grandma, I'm in jail and need help...\" absolutely failed in practice.  For better or worse, my other Grandmother had been scammed a couple times and towards the end of her life didn't have the finances to scam any more from, living with my mom and her sisters. Unfortunately the scams themselves range from amazingly complex to what should be really easy to spot.  I make it a rule to NEVER give personal information to someone that calls me unexpectedly, at least nothing that isn't already effectively public information. Annoying when your doctor's office has an automated system that calls and the first thing it does is ask for your social security number...  My response is \"nope, not doing it\" and that's what I told anyone that would listen at that office every visit... it's training people to get scammed. reply",

No legitimate organization needs full, permanent control over your bank account. If a situation feels incredibly urgent, it is almost certainly a scam. • Taxes?

They basically \"waste the scammers time\".  The scams rely on low effort ways to find the target, robocalls, emails, etc.  But once the target is found they have to put real effort into implementation.  With AI, this will only become easier on their end. I would look into solutions that would make it harder for them.  Like AI chatbots that act like targets, both text and voice.  If the majority of their efforts end up being weeks of conversation with an AI before they figure it out then it will not be worth the effort. Right now it may take them hours to find a viable target then days to extort them.  Make it take longer, until it is more lucrative to get a legitimate job. I used to think it was fun to mess with scammers... but I think these days many of them are forced into it.  Basically they are lured in with reasonable sounding job offers then once they find themselves in another country with only their \"employer\" look out for them, they basically become slave labor. You need to hurt the ones trapping the slaves that run the scams, and your weapon is the same as theirs... technology. reply",

I got really emotional but then after reading it, I saw it was a generic threat and nothing could be done. You are asking, what can be done? Start with the basics, strong password and MFA everywhere. Avoided pirated Windows, and if you can avoid the OS entirely as well. Basic cybersecurity awareness need to be taught in schools.

Truth be told that scamming is becoming easier and easier. The problem is that most countries not only allow it, it is part of their GDP. Look at the number of scammers that originate in India. Everyone there knows who they are, there are numerous YouTube channels souly dedicated to exposing them and reporting them to the authorities, yet they still remain active. Until a more brutal and direct response is used, these organizations and countries will continue to operate. If the attacks Trump has used on drug boats has taught us anything is that a direct response is the best response when dealing with the underworld. reply",

          "text": "(If you're OP: this is not a solution per se but more of a generalist rant; just so you don't waste critical time) People talk about changing laws or technical solutions, but the inconvenient truth is that technically literate people should peer-pressure nearby friends/family/etc. into being more aware of such possibilities. I've done so, to the extent that some people find it ether borderline schizophrenic/paranoid (to my \"luck\", I live in an ex-communist country, where most people are usually skeptical in many contexts with strangers; so this group of people is relatively small). People who know better bear a responsibility towards helping others who don't; towards those who are too kind (or naive) for their own good; Even though I'm the \"tech guy\" in my close circles (family, friends,etc.) like many here, I often do the >opposite< of what other \"pro-technologists\" do these days: I don't encourage people, especially the older generation OR the more tech-illiterate ones to use more technology, because it is obvious that doing so \"injects\" another vector of attacks into their lives. More often these days this is not possible, everything gets digitalized to the detriment of such groups, but this also delves into the politics of keeping \"older options\" (cash, paper trails, etc.) available even if digitalization happens. Often times the older options are more secure, though obviously less convenient. This is a non-solution, yes, but it is the correct way to approach this (imo), as more and more places LEGALLY force digitalization of different institutions(banking, gov. agencies, etc.)  which inherently either add, or worse, completely shift the risk into virtual spaces. This is why a \"legal\" solution is more often than not either a slow one or a completely pointless one. It will always be an arms-race between scammers(which operate more effectively[in theory] due to their decentralized nature) and the gov./banks/etc., which operate in a more centralized fashion, thus demanding and imposing more control above all included parties. A legal way will always demand more than it's worth. I digress from my shift into politics, but bottom line is this: don't let your peers/family/closed ones get into these situations. If you have \"an authoritative\" voice regarding tech, use it to first cultivate awareness regarding dangers, before cultivating hype/or anything else. (Obviously not talking about anyone specifically, but the whole \"geeksphere\" as a whole) Good luck to you and your family. reply",

          "text": "From the author of Redis on MicroQuickJS[1]: > If this had been available in 2010, Redis scripting would have been JavaScript and not Lua. With that in mind we can do a quick search to see how Lua is used. I found an article on Wikipedia titled \"List of applications using Lua\"[2]. Of course that's not an exhaustive list but it gives you a bit of an idea. Off the top of my head, the places I've personally seen Lua used: 1. modifying DNS responses in PowerDNS 2. neovim plugins 3. video game mods like Factorio Personally I got into programming by writing shell scripts. I never studied computer science or IT. Instead it was the ability to write basic code for existing software that gave me this accidental introduction to the world of writing logic down as a set of machine-readable instructions. For me, MicroQuickJS is another one of those ways for \"power users\" (who may themselves be professional software developers) to extend some existing software without getting into the nitty gritty of the big bad upstream dev project.

          "text": "If you have some software that’s somewhat rigid you could make it scriptable by linking microquickjs. For example, lately i was looking into patching dnsmasq to handle events but found out that the dhcp-script flag most likely does what i need. Otherwise i could patch dnsmasq to load microquickjs, evaluate some javascript functions and hook into events emitted by the dnsmasq regular lifecycle. I might end up doing that anyway, since it looks like a fun thing to do. reply",
