Punting it to 2026. I'm thinking to get the Samsung Galaxy XR and experiment with some VR apps and learn the fundamentals of spatial computing. As an Android mobile developer, that feels like a natural extension.<p>- Complete the \"UCSanDiegoX: Computer Graphics II: Rendering\" computer graphics course. I did the first course in the series and found it enlightening (no pun intended)<p>- Create an e2e project that earns money as a side gig. It's time to put my product and technical knowledge to practice and actually build something people want.<p>- Leverage AI across all my endeavors. AI tools are here to stay and the more I know how to use them effectively, the better. The speed boost in learning a new framework/concept is phenomenal.<p>Non-technical skills:<p>- Expand my social circle - the unstable tech climate made me realize the importance of maintaining a healthy social network. My goal is to connect with more people both inside my company and outside, by both proactively reaching out and going to meetups in my area. In fact, I invite fellow NYC-based HN-ers to contact me at cybercreampuff at yahoo dot com, in case you want to meet up!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "This is a new years resolution question barely in disguise, but they're fun cause a lot of us are cooped up, barely 4 days into winter, 86ish to go, and we're champing at the bit for change. I am pretty sure I'm a 50th percentiler. I'm mid 40s, kinda burned out but still struggling forward in my ok-but-not-hollywood IT career, I still have a passion for doing things well in a technical society that values doing things cheap (and well). The things I am known for being good at, I still google daily, and for a long time, I've been hungry for a change - any change - but especially one that isn't chaotically negative. So in 2026, I wanna learn how dirt works. I actually have a giant box of dirt sitting on a shelf at the UNH community co-op soil analysis lab, waiting to give me some kind of data about the soil behind my house. (Or is it dirt? I don't know what I'm getting into). In 2024 I tried growing some corn. It never sprouted. In 2025 I tried growing some corn. It sprouted and a few ears had enough kernels to make one full mouthful. Tasty, but maybe 7 calories of food for a year of effort. So in 2026 I'd like to grow: one entire fully formed ear of sweet corn. Anything else is a bonus. That's what I wanna develop in 2026 - learning how soil works enough to make it make a thing.  Small moves, Ellie. reply",

          "text": "Great hobby! A couple of things about corn. It might not be soil at issue. Germination depends on correct temperature and moisture. Too much moisture the seed will rot or not have enough air to germinate. Too little moisture it won't trigger germination. Too deep it won't germinate, too shallow and germination won't happen either because it will dry out instead of staying moist. Seeds vary in depth they require and some even require light to germinate (doesn't apply to corn). It's a bit of an art figuring out what \"even moisture until germination\" is, and this varies based on soil type. Timing of planting with correct temperature is important. Each kernel of corn has one silk. The silk is analogous to a Fallopian tube with pollen traveling down into the ovary (or kernel of corn in this case). If you have an ear of corn with only a few kernels it's often because pollen didn't land on all the silks. For this reason corn is usually planted in blocks. It's wind pollinated so wind shakes pollen off the tassels or male flowers at the top, down onto the silk. But if you just have one corn plant in isolation, or a row in isolation it's easier for the pollen to just blow away or miss. Planting in blocks or \"array of arrays\" configuration helps the pollen to reach the silk more uniformly as pollen from the surrounding plants is released. reply",

          "text": "That's kinda wild to hear about the corn because I've found corn to be one of the easiest crops to grow. If you want to try again, these are the seeds I last used which had 100% germination and produced plenty of ears of corn. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005MI33BS I've also had a ton of luck growing corn in 5 gallon buckets with holes drilled in the side to allow air into the soil which keeps the roots from balling up (wasting energy that should go into growing ears).  Used potting mix with a handful of lime and a handful of epsom salt, and topped the buckets with mulch to retain moisture. If you're willing to try that approach, this was very similar to my system: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptgJn15TmRM reply",

I have similar years experience and regularly try out AI for development but always find it’s slower for the things I want to build and/or that it produces less than satisfactory results. Not sure if it’s how I use the models (I’ve experimented with all the frontier ones), or the types of things I’m building, or the languages I’m using, or if I’m not spending enough, or if it’s just my standards are too high for the code that is produced but I usually always end up going back to doing things by hand. I try to keep the AI focused on small well defined tasks, use AGENT.MD and skills, build out a plan first, followed by tests for spec based development, keep context windows and chats a reasonable length etc, but if I add up all that time I could have done it myself and have better grasp of the program and the domain in the process. I keep reading how AI is a force multiplier but I’m yet to see it play out for myself. I see lots of posts talking about how much more productive AI has made people, but very few with actual specifics on setup, models, costs, workflows etc. I’m not an AI doomer and would love to realize the benefits people are claiming they get.... but how to get there is the question reply",

Then I wrote a large feature (ad pacing) on a site using LLMs. I learned the LLMs did not really understand what they were doing. The algorithm (PID controller) itself was properly implemented (as there is plenty of data to train on), but it was trying to optimize the wrong thing. There were other similar findings where LLM was doing very stupid mistakes. So I went through a disillusionment stage and kind of gave up for a while. Since then, I have learned how to use Claude Code effectively. I have used it mostly on existing Django code bases. I think everybody has a slightly different take on how it works well. Probably the most reasonable advice is to just keep going and try different kind of things. Existing code bases seem easier, as well as working on a spec beforehand, requiring tests etc. basic SWE principles. reply",

This is where I’ve been at for a while now. Every couple of months I try again with latest models and latest techniques I hear people talking about but there’s very little concrete info there that works for me. Then I wonder if it’s just my spend? I don’t mind spending $30/month to experiment but I’m not going to drop $300/month unless I can see evidence that it’ll be worth it, which I haven’t really seen, but maybe there’s a dependency and you don’t get the result without increased spend?

          "text": "> This is step 3 of “draw the rest of the owl” :-) Fair enough :-) This reminds me about pigeon research by Skinner. Skinner placed hungry pigeons in a \"Skinner box\" and a mechanism delivered food pellets at fixed, non-contingent time intervals, regardless of the bird's behavior. The pigeons, seeking a pattern or control over the food delivery, began to associate whatever random action they were performing at the moment the food appeared with the reward. I think we humans have similar psychology, i.e. we tend to associate superstitions about patterns of what were doing when we got rewards, if they happen at random intervals. To me it seems we are at a phase where what works with LLMs *(the reward) are still quite random, but it is psychologically difficult for us to admit it. Therefore we try to invent various kinds of theories of why something appears to work, which are closer to superstitions than real repeatable processes. It seems difficult to really generalize repeatable processes of what really works, because it depends on too many things. This may be the reason why you are unsuccessful when using these descriptions. But while it seems less useful to try to work based on theories of what works -- although I had skeptical attitude -- I have found that LLMs can be huge productive boost -- but it really depends on the context. It seems you just need to keep trying various things, and eventually you may find out what works for you. There is no shortcut where you just read a blog post and then you can do it. Things I have tried succesfully:\n- modifying existing large-ish Django projects, adding new apps to it. It can sometimes use Django components&HTMX/AlpineJS properly, but sometimes starts doing something else. One app uses tenants, and LLM appears to constantly struggle with this.\n- creating new Django projects -- this was less successful than modifying existing projects, because LLM could not imitate practices\n- Apple Swift mobile and watch applications. This was surprisingly succesful. But these were not huge apps.\n- python GUI app was more or less succesful\n- GitHub Pages static web sites based on certain content I have not copied any CLAUDE.md or other files. Every time Claude Code does something I don't appreciate, I add a new line. Currently it is at 26 lines. I have made a few skills. They are mostly so that they can work independently in a loop, for example test something that does not work. Typically I try to limit the technologies to something I know really well. When something fails, I can often quickly figure out what is wrong. I started with the basic plan (I guess it is that $30/month). I only upgraded to $100 Max and later to $180 2xMax because I was hitting limits. But reason I was hitting limits was because I was working on multiple projects on multiple environments at the same time.  The only difference I have seen is that I have hit the limits. I have not seen any difference in quality. reply",

          "text": "Thanks for the info. I try a mix of things I know well and things I want to play around with. Swift and iOS was something that didn’t work so well for me.  I wanted to play around with face capture and spent a day with Claude putting together a small app that showed realtime video of a face and put dots on/around various facial features and printed log messages if the person changed the direction they were looking (up down left right) and played a sound when they opened their mouth. I’ve done app development before, but it’s been a few years so was a little bit rusty and it felt like Claude was really helping me out. Then I got to a point I was happy with and I thought I’d go deeper in the code to understand what it was doing and how it was working (not a delegation issue as per another comment, this was a play/learning exercise for me so wanted to understand how it all worked) - and right there in the apple developer documentation was a sample so that did basically the same thing as my app, only the code was far simpler and after reading through the accompanying docs I realized the Claude version had a threading issue waiting to happen that was explicitly warned against in the docs of the api calls it was using. If I’d gone to the developer docs in the beginning I would have had a better app, and better understanding in maybe a quarter of the time. Appreciate the info on spend.  The above session was on the $30/month version of Claude. I guess I need to just keep flapping my wings until I can draw the owl. reply",

Subjectively interacting with an LLM gives a sense of progress, but objectively downloading a sample project and tutorial gets me to the same point with higher quality materials much faster. I keep thinking about research on file navigation via command line versus using a mouse. People’s subjective sense of speed and capability don’t necessarily line up with measurable outcomes.

          "text": "> I realized the Claude version had a threading issue waiting to happen that was explicitly warned against in the docs of the api calls it was using. I am reading between the lines here, trying genuinely to be helpful, so forgive me if I am not on the right track. But based on what you write, it seems to me you might have not really gone through the disillusionment phase yet. You seem to be assuming the models \"understand\" more than they really are capable of understanding, which creates expectations and then disappointment. It seems to be you are still expecting CC to work at a level of a senior professional on various roles, instead of assuming it is a junior professional. I would have probably approached that iOS app by first investigting various options how the app could be implemented (especially as I don't have deep understanding of the tech), and then explore each option to understand myself what is the best one. The options in your example might be the Apple documentation page. It it might be some open source repo that contains something that could be used as a starting point etc. Then I would have asked Claude to create a plan to implement the best option. During either the option selection or planning, the threading issue would either come up or not. It might come up explicitly, in which case I could learn it from the plans. It might be implicit, just included in the generated code. Or it might not be included in the plans or in the code, even if it is explicitly stated in the documentation. If the suggested plan would be based on that documentation, then I would probably read it myself too, and might have seen the suggestion. When reviewing the plan, I can use my prior knowledge to ask whether that issue has been taken into account. If not, then Claude would modify the plan. Of course, if I did not know about the threading issue beforehand, and did not have the general experience about the tech to suspect such as a issue, nor read the documentation and see the recommendation, I could not find the issue myself either. If the issue is not found in planning or progamming, the issue would arise at later stage, hopefully while unit/system testing the application, or pilot use. I have not written complex iOS apps personally so I might have not caught it either -- I am not senior enough to guide it. I would ask it to plan again how to comprehenively test such an app, to learn how it should be done. What I meant by standard SWE practices is that there are various stages (requirements, specification, design, programming, testing, pilot use) where the solution is reviewed from multiple angles, so it becomes likely that this kind of issues are caught. The best practices also include iteration. Start with something small that works. For example, first an iOS application that compiles, and shows \"Hello, world\" etc. and can be installed on your phone. In my experience, CC cannot be expected to independently work as a senior professional on any role (architect, programmer, test manager, tester, pilot user, product manager, project manager). Junior might not take into account all instructions or guidance even if it is explicit. But it can act as a junior professional on any of these roles, so it can help senior professional to get the 10x productivity boost on any of these areas. By project manager role, I mean that I am explicitly taking the CC through the various SWE stages and making sure they have been done properly, and also that I iterate on the solution. On each one of the stages, I take the role of the respective senior professional. If I cannot do it yet, I try to learn how to do it. At the same time, I work as a product manager/owner as well, to make decisions about the product, based on my personal \"taste\" and requirements. reply",

I mean I'm definitely still in the stage of disillusionment, but I'm not treating LLMs as senior or expecting much from them. The example I gave played out much as you described above. I used an iterative process, with multiple self-contained smaller steps, each with a planning and discussion stage where I got the AI to identify ways to achieve what I was looking to do and weigh up tradeoffs that I then decided on, followed by a design clarification and finalisation stage, before finally getting it to write code (very hard sometimes to get the AI not to write code until the design has been finalised), followed by adjustments to that code as necessary. The steps involved were something like: - build the app skeleton - open a camera feed - display the feed full screen - flip the feed so it responded as a mirror would if you were looking at it - use the ios apis to get facial landmarks - display the landmarks as dots - detect looking in different directions and print a log message. - detect the user opening their mouth - play a sound when the mouth transitions from closed to open - etc Each step was relatively small and self-contained, with a planning stage first and me asking the AI probing/clarifying questions. The threading issue didn't come up at all in any of this. Once it came, the AI tied itself in knots trying to sort it out, coming up with very complex dispatching logic that still got things incorrect. It was a fun little project, but if I compare the output it just wasn't equivalent to what I could get if I'd just started with the Apple documentation (thought maybe it's different now, as per another commenter's reply). It's also easily completeable in a day if you want to give it a try :-)  Apple Developer reference implementation [here]( https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Vision/tracking-th... ). > By project manager role, I mean that I am explicitly taking the CC through the various SWE stages and making sure they have been done properly, and also that I iterate on the solution.

These kind of loops have happened to me as well. It sometimes requires clearing of context + some inventive step to help the LLM out of the loop.

          "text": "I'm pretty sure I have the right intellectual and emotional understanding of the AI and its abilities. > I consider this to be partly what I mean by \"LLM is a junior\" and that \"I act as the project manager\". And this is partly what I mean when I say the time I spend instructing the \"junior\" LLM could be just as well spent implementing the code myself - because the \"project manager\" side of me can work with the \"senior dev\" side of me at the speed of thought and often in parallel, and solving the challenges and the design of something is often where most of the time is spent anyway. Skills are changing this equation somewhat due to the way they can encode repeatable knowledge, but not so much for me yet especially if I'm trying things out in radically different areas (I'm still in my experimental stage with them). > Could you really have done a complex mobile app alone in one day without knowing the stack well beforehand? No, but that's not what happened here. The mobile app wasn't complex (literally only does the things outlined above) and I've done enough mobile development and graphics/computer vision development before that the stack and concepts involved weren't completely unknown, just the specifics of the various iOS APIs and how to string them together - hence why I initially thought it would be a good use case for AI. It was also an incredible coincidence that the toy app I wanted to build had an apple developer tutorial that did almost the same thing as what I was looking to build, and so yes, I clearly would have been better off using the documentation as a starting point rather than the AI. That sort of coincidence won't always exist, but I've thinking lately about another toy iOS/apple watch application, and I checked, and once again there is a developer tutorial that closely matches what I'm looking to build.  If I ever get around to experimenting with that, the developer docs are going to be my first port of call rather than an AI. > I certainly could not have done one year ago what I can do today, with these tools. Right, and if you look back at my original reply (not to you), this is what I'm trying to understand - the what and how of AI productivity gains, because if I evaluate the output I get it's almost always either something I could have built faster and better, or if not faster then at least better and not so much slower that the AI was enabling a week of work to be done in a day, and month of work to be done in a week (claims from the GP, not you). I would love to be able to realize those gains - and I can see the potential but just not the results. reply",

          "text": "I’m perfectly comfortable and used to delegating, but delegation requires  trust that the result will be fit for purpose. It doesn’t have to be exactly how I would do it but at a minimum it has to work correctly and have acceptable performance for the task at hand. This doesn’t mean being super optimized just that it shouldn’t be doing stupid things like n+1 requests or database queries etc. See a sibling comment for one example on correctness, another one related to performance was querying some information from a couple of database tables (the first with 50,000 rows the next with 2.5 million) After specifying things in enough detail to let the AI go, it got correct results but performance was rather slow. A bit more back and forthing and it got up to processing 4,000 rows a second. It was so impressed with its new performance it started adding rocket ship emojis to the output summary. There were still some obvious (to me) performance issues so I pressed it to see if it could improve the performance.  It started suggesting some database config tweaks which provided some marginal improvements but was still missing some big wins elsewhere - namely it was avoiding “expensive” joins and doing that work in the app instead - resulting in n+1 db calls. So I suggested getting the DB to do the join and just processing the fully joined data on the app side. This doubled throughout (8,000 rows/second) and led to claims from the AI this was now enterprise ready code. There was still low hanging fruit though because it was calling the db and getting all results back before processing anything. After suggesting switching to streaming results (good point!) we got up to 10,000 rows/second. This was acceptable performance, but after a bit more wrangling we got things up to 11,000 rows/second and now it wasn’t worth spending much extra time squeezing out more performance. In the end the AI came to a good result, but, at each step of the way it was me hinting it in the correct direction and then the AI congratulating me on the incredible “world class performance” (actual quote but difficult to believe when you then double performance again). If it has just been me I would have finished it in half the time. If I’d delegated to a less senior employee and we’d gone back and forth a bit pairing to get it to this state it might have taken the same amount and effort but they would’ve at least learnt something. Not so with the AI however - it learns nothing and I have to make sure I re-explain things and concepts all over again the next time and in sufficient detail that it will do a reasonable job (not expecting perfection, just needs to be acceptable). And so my experience so far (much more than just these 2 examples) is that I can’t trust the AI to the point where I can delegate enough that I don’t spend more time supervising/correcting it than I would spend writing things myself. Edit: using AI to explain existing code is a useful thing it can do well.  My experience is it is much better at explaining code than producing it. reply",

When I’m writing my own code I can verify the logic as I go and coupled with a strong type system and a judicious use of _some_ tests its generally enough for my code to be correct. By comparison the AI needs more tests to keep it on the right path otherwise the final code is not fit for purpose. For example in a recent use case I needed to take a json blob containing an array of strings that contained numbers and needed to return an array of Decimals sorted in ascending order. This seemed a perfect use case - a short well defined task with clear success criteria so I spent a bunch of time writing the requirements and building out a test suite and then let the AI do its thing. The AI produced ok code, but it was sorted everything lexicographically before converting to a Decimal rather converting to Decimals first and sorting numerically so 1000 was less than 900. So I point it out and the AI says good point, you’re absolutely correct and we add a test for this and it goes again and gets the right result but that’s not a mistake I would have made or needed a test for (though you could argue it’s a good test to have). You could also argue that I should have specified the problem more clearly, but then we come back to the point that if I’m writing every specific detail in English first, it’s faster for me just to write it in code in the first place. reply",

If it fails, it’s not allowed to edit the source code, instead it must determine if there is a bug in the test or the source code. If the test is buggy it should try again, if there is a bug in the source code it should pause, propose a fix, and consult with you on next steps.

I am not going to just deny myself access to apps on schedule -- my brain never clicked schedule, not even once in my life -- but through a persistent and sustainable self-change from deep within. It's slow but it's beginning to work. - MANDATORY: Get more intimate with my Neovim. I've always kind of half-arsed my editors / IDEs, I always found it annoying to become a deep expert. This must change; surface-level skills rob you of productivity. I already am hugely annoyed by my typing speed, which is quite excellent but still not enough to work almost at the speed of thought. I want to achieve something near to these levels. - OPTIONAL: Integrate closer with one ore more LLM agents for coding. I have not paid for any yet but copying-pasting from a web UI gets tiring. Sometimes you really just want to say \"OK, now remove that duplicate test and include that edge case\" and see it materialize in 20 seconds. I am not against paying, it's just that so far the paid tiers have not been a blocker. Well, seems like they are now. - MANDATORY: Prioritize body. I have health conditions and I have a relatively good visibility how to fix them. I regularly end up desperately trying to solve more and more problems on the computer just so I don't get up and start a workout. I started turning this around but it's way too slow and time and age don't wait for anyone. In general: connect better with myself, forgive myself all the previous mistakes, understand why and how they came to be and remove the root causes, put myself on a better path. And above all: be more true to myself. reply",

          "text": "I would not even know how to call my so-called \"technique\" if somebody else did not do it for me: awareness. What I do I would today call \"reconciliation\" or \"making peace\". Let me explain. On the one hand, I start recognizing in a colder, more methodical and mathematical manner, what things I did screw up in my life and why. I drill down and understand what emotions, unmet needs and un-addressed trauma led to these faulty decisions. Then I say: I understand why I did it but this only worked against me, it's time to change it and put myself on a better path. And by \"better path for me\" I don't mean only financial and career success; I mean those _and_ being happier and calmer. On the other hand, I allow my more beastly / primitive / emotional / immature side to show up. I don't shun it, I try to sympathize with it and somewhat validate it. That's basically treating a part of yourself like an angry and lost kid: you do feel for them but want them to stop doing damage. But you also want to not force anything on them; you want them to understand and internalize they are only hurting themselves and others (in this case: other parts of you) with zero benefit for anyone involved. --- It's not easy. I had a very rocky start in life. Sure I did not sleep under bridges but growing up in a shitty Eastern European town with a gay brother and you yourself being the nerd who effortlessly gets all A grades and is also good at karate, physically attractive and liked by girls sadly had a ton of downsides that many people are blind of. Almost everyone hates you for being different and they feel threatened by you while all you want is to fit in and be a part of a friendly group. It was and still is a big tragedy, one I don't claim I have managed to come to terms with even as of today. --- But what I do lately is talk to my more primal side: \"Look, I really understand how much you hate doing X and Y. I hate them too! But what else would you do? We did it your way for so long, you had an almost complete full reign and look what happened -- now we all suffer from severely diminished physical and mental health, we hate our life and often our work, we know that we wasted our best years on pointlessly rebelling against things we could never change. Where did all that bring us? Please, work with me. I understand that you never feel heard because we never achieved the life you wanted. But I can't see any shortcuts. Do you? If not, then let us please take the long but much safer road to our goals. That way we'll still get there one day. If we are not making progress then we'll talk again and readjust strategy and maybe do things more your way. But in the meantime, can we do things my way for a while? Please?\" Or something very similar. But all that is 99% specific to me. You really have to find your own way to your deeper and more primal / emotional side. It exists and very often sabotages you because you never give it the wheel. Being civilized does this to us and no, I am not saying you should go outside and beat someone to death with a ratchet wrench of course. I mean that you should find a way to do the things you truly want, regardless of the cost. I am NOT doing this well at the moment. For example I am too chicken to give up programming. But as mentioned above, I am trying to reconcile a few factors the best way I can for the moment. Maybe if that unlocks more energy and more motivation then the time would be ripe for more drastic measures. One step at a time. reply",

I don't do anything anymore these days to advance my career in SWE.

I often marveled at people who create database, compilers, emulators, 3D engines, version controls, text editors, etc. Those people are like wizards to me. I wonder how can I be creative like that? Like, how can you just wake up one day and decide to create magic. I want to learn how to do those. Any advice is appreciated.

Seems like kind of strange / yet somewhat appropriate choice since Forth \"traditionally use neither operating system nor file system.\" and \"A full-featured Forth system with all source code will compile itself\".  Bootstrap your own operating system on a computer with literally nothing. Interesting to read about though as a tangent, very different kind of language.  \"grammar has no official specification\"  \"looks the word up in the dictionary\" and then does whatever the dictionary specifies. Good luck on the project though, seems like it fell out of use in the 80's and only got recovered recently.  The Forth Interest Group comments on the subject are funny too. [1]  \"What ANS Forths are available?\" -> \"The simple answer is: none\"  Apparently somebody (Vincent Hamp) got it to work on Thumb-2 ISA (ARMv7-M and newer) though.  Tiny.  7kb flash, 320B of ram.

          "text": "The primary virtue of a Forth system is that it is interactive.  You can see this on any 1990s system that can start up in Open Firmware. I've started with a FIG-Forth kernel in 9900 assembler, which fits into 8K.  Many authors worked that code up to the 1990s branch I grabbed. To bring up the board, I cross-assemble to produce two Flash EEPROMs, plug them in, and power up.  The Forth kernel looks at block 6 for customizations where I tell it to compile some source packages I want from Flash.  One of these is -ASSEMBLER, which lets me create short chunks of native machine code to work on very low-level things like bit I/O, the SPI and I2C peripheral behavior.  Very good for debugging initial hardware. When I'm happy with some code, I add the source to the next EEPROM build. Block numbers were originally 1K chunks of disk, but can refer to any kind of storage like pages of ROM/RAM, or even to a process' virtual address space. reply",

          "text": "Similar experience w/ my daughter (now 12 y/o) here. We read the heck out of children's books when she was little. There were nights when I really didn't want to slog thru the same Suzy Spafford[6] book again, but I did it anyway. I think it paid off. My daughter is an avid reader now. She says she still wants me to read to her, so I do. This year was a bit sci-fi heavy, and we've decided to target more fantasy and literature in 2026. This year's books included: \"Below the Root\", \"And All Between\", and \"Until the Celebration\" - The \"Green Sky Trilogy\"[0] by Zilpha Keatly Snyder. We held off on playing the \"Below the Root\" video game[1] but I'm hoping that as we get into winter weather and outside time becomes more scarce we can get to it. It's arguably the final book in the \"trilogy\". \"Redshirts\"[2] by John Scalzi. We've been slowly making our way through Star Trek TOS in the last couple years so. That gave her enough cultural fluency with the tropes in the book to make it effective. \"To Say Nothing of the Dog\"[3] by Connie Willis. My daughter adores Victorian England and comedy. This book also turned her on to Jerome K. Jerome's \"Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog)\"[4] (which I'm still working thru on my own-- I do not particularly love Victorian England but it is a good book). Besides the books I read to my daughter, I also read Martha Wells' \"The Murderbot Diaries\"[5] series myself. I'm vaguely interested in the television adaptation. I'd love to hear what somebody who has read the series thinks of the TV version.

It felt like it was made for fans (the portrayal of the embedded show, Sanctuary Moon, was wonderful and I felt like whoever did their hairstyles had an immense amount of fun), yet accessible without knowing the story. Murderbot’s self-narration was good; I wanted more since it drove so much of the book but what was there in the show carried its personality well. Alexander Skarsgard pulled the character off well. My mental picture of Murderbot from the books was very different but now when I re-read the first book after watching the show, I heard his voice. I still feel slightly sad they didn’t get a more genderless or gender-ambivalent actor (he looks male, the bot was agender before the show) or tried to portray him differently… they could have reduced this but the way they filmed him assigns gender to an ungendered character. The other actors were all excellent too. I felt far more of a sense of them as a team and individuals than I remember from the first book. If you enjoyed the books I think you’ll enjoy the show, except for me that it has changed my picture of Murderbot and I am not sure for the better, in terms of what I felt were social / identity values the books encouraged. reply",

The narration seemed incredibly challenging (and kept making me think of \"A Christmas Story\", of all things). The integration of \"Sanctuary Moon\" sounds particularly fun. I definitely see Murderbot as genderless and seeing it as gendered is going to be weird. Fortunately, the series isn't particularly \"dear\" to me and I think I can deal with the trauma of having my mental pictures wiped-out by somebody else's. (There are properties like \"Neuromancer\" and \"Snow Crash\" that I hope are never adapted to video and, if they are, I will steadfastly refuse to ever see, because I can't imagine anybody else's mental pictures will be better than mine...) reply",

I've never seen \"A Christmas Story\" (Wikipedia shows it as very American-cultural-icon) but reading the synopsis, I'm surprised how many parts of it are semi-familiar, perhaps culturally reflected in other ways.

          "text": "Technical followed by non-technical. I read more than these, but these are the highlights. Mouse, a Language for Microcomputers by Peter Grogono - Mouse is basically an esolang with barely any abstraction facilities, but the book was well-written and the language compelling enough to explore further. Notes on Distance Dialing (pdf) by AT&T - Described the telephone systems of the USA and Canada in the mid-1950s. The reading is a dry as it gets, but it was a fascinating dive into a vastly complex system solving extremely hard problems. This is a must-read for folks interested in systems-thinking. That said, I am actively looking for recommendations for books about the process of designing and building the unbelievably complex telephony system over the rudiments of the earlier systems. Recommendations welcomed! The Eye of Osiris by R. Austin Freeman - This is the first book that I’ve read from Freeman and I suspect that I will read many more in the future. The story follows the disappearance of John Bellingham, Egyptologist and the subsequent investigation. As the investigation stalls, the eminent Dr. Thorndyke digs into the case. The story sets up the mystery nicely and indeed provides enough information to the reader to infer how the disappearance occurred and who or what facilitated it. The book is one of the best whodunits that I’ve ever read. The Mystery of Edwin Drood by Charles Dickens - His final work remains unfinished as he passed away before he could complete it. Further complicating the meta-story is that he also didn’t outline the ending nor even put to paper the “villain” of the story. The meta-mystery of the ending has motivated a mountain of speculation around the ending including dozens of continuations of the story from other authors, all deriving their pet endings from textual hints, accounts from Dickens’ friends, illustration notes, and even in some cases seances supposedly accompanied by the spirit of Dickens himself. What was written by Dickens is spectacular and a compelling mystery and although it would be great to know the resolution, in some ways the “Droodiana” that has cropped up over the past 150+ years is reason enough for it to remain a mystery. The whole lore around Edwin Drood is a worthwhile hobby in itself and well-worth exploring. The Chiltern Library edition of the book contains the story and a good bit of the lore around the writing and the meta-works available at the time of its publication. The Shadow People by Margaret St. Clair - Sadly out of print and difficult to find, but I’ve had it on my shelves for decades and finally got around to reading it. The book came onto my radar in the 1980s when I learned about it in the appendix-n of the 1st edition Advanced D&D Dungeon Masters Guide. I enjoyed many of the books at the time and have slowly swung around to re-reading them over the past few years. Sadly, most on the list do not stand the test of time for me, but St. Clair’s mixture of 60s counter-cultural leanings in a fantasy/sf world still works. The cultural touch-points in the book feel quite dated, but despite the occasional awkwardness, the story is unique even today. Lolly Willowes by Sylvia Townsend Warner - The book started as a passable novel of manners focused on a turn of the century British middle-class family. The titular character was mostly background decoration for the first third of the novel and AFAIR was talked about only in the third-person. It’s only when she made the choice to move out on her own to the country in her middle age does she gain a central role in the narrative and her inner thoughts revealed. This is where things really pick up because I was shocked to learn that this unassuming woman’s inner thoughts had a delicious darkness to them. I don’t want to give away too much, but I’ll just say that you will not expect how the story ends. Patience by Daniel Clowes - A profound graphic novel using time-travel to explore the idea of enduring love with a story that proceed through time, following Jack as he tries to alter the past and save the woman he loves. This well-known science fiction motif is elevated by Clowes’ signature psychological complexity. Narcissus and Goldmund by Herman Hesse - I’ve read most of the books by Hermann Hesse but this one escaped my attention until this year. The story follows the parallel lives of a monk Narcissus and his passionate friend Goldmund as they respectively search for meaning in life through spiritual means and through pleasures of the flesh. We Who Are About To… by Joanna Russ - A small group of astronauts crash land on a hostile alien world and quickly realize that rescue is unlikely to come. Many SF stories have started this way and so the expectation is that this is a colonization story… but Russ thrives on subverting reader expectations. Fifty Forgotten Records by R.B. Russell - Another lovely entry in Russell’s series (one can hope) of autobiographical explorations of art, so far covering literature and now music. This book describes 50 records of varying popularity and Russell’s personal connections to each. While I certainly enjoyed finding a dozen or so new albums to explore, the true triumph of the book lies in the vulnerable, reflective memoir threaded throughout. The Way of All Flesh by Samuel Butler A novel that follows 4-generations of the Ponitifex family, with a particular bildungsroman-esque thread around Ernest, a young man who’s naivete leads to his downfall and how his life unfolds thereafter.

          "text": "Sci-fi nerd recommendations follow. I binged the entirety of the Dungeon Crawler Carl series. The cover, & the fact that it was on Kindle Unlimited, made me think it was probably cheap crap, but I was impressed with how well-written it was, and how much I empathized with the characters. (I probably should have read it slower; by the last two books, I was just flowing with the text, not paying as much attention to the overarching plot.) Heinlein's \"Orphans of the Sky\" was pretty bad. So much early scifi is considered great because it's groundbreaking, writing about things nobody else has before. The concept of a generation ship was pretty new at the time Heinlein was writing it, and it has some very interesting concepts, but the book has some really bad problems . If you've read it, you know; if you haven't, and decide to, you'll see it for yourself. I binged a few Brandon Sanderson books. The standalones are great; the Stormlight Archive is a huge slog through some beautiful writing, but I'm not sure I'm willing to spend so much time in beautiful books that move the plot forward so slowly. Exordia, by Seth Dickinson, started off incredible, kept going, but the ending felt like both a fizzle as well as a cliff-hanger for the next book. I'm glad I read it, but I wish it had a clear conclusion it wanted to reach. Adrian Tchaikovsky's \"Children of Memory\" delivers more of the great philosophical questions & answers about the nature of consciousness and personhood that the previous books did, A+. No idea where he could possibly go from there, but if he does, I'm going along for the journey. (Honorable mention: Alien Clay. Dishonorable mention: Service Model.) Eric Flint's \"Fenrir\" was a fun BDO near-future space adventure. (As was John Sanford's Saturn Run, but that wasn't a 2025 book I read.) reply",

You can now read lots of those stories on-line (like at https://www.freesfonline.net/Magazines2.html ).  Some of them have stood the test of time, but some are really really bad.  John Campbell, the editor of Analog back then, was racist, and also convinced that smoking tobacco was a Good Thing.  Many of the stories were written (by others) to convey those ideas; it's almost unusual for lead characters not to light up a cigarette. It will be interesting to see how much of today's scifi holds up half a century from now---not because the science is wrong, but because the moral qualities will be judged outlandish. reply",

          "text": "I'm not influential enough but I'll share the recommendations I think will help people like me: struggling parents. This year I've reread The Discontented Little Baby Book. If you're getting/have a newborn, this is the book I'd read. It's humane. No sleep training, no nonsense about babies. We went full ‘possum’ with our baby and I like how happy he became. I've also read Ten Things I Wish You Knew About Your Child's Mental Health. To me this could be an instant classic. No fluff, lots of advice for parents. Prima. There's plenty of literature on parenting, but so much of it is poorly written or poorly researched. Be careful out there. (And don't read PLS, yikes.) --- I finally discovered Andy Weir, the Thursday Next series, and The 13.5 Lives of Captain Bluebear. I'm amazed it took me so long to get there. All excellent. For some reason I decided to read all 7 Harry Potters in French. If you're learning French, it's a great idea, the French gets progressively harder so you can keep up! Bryson's At Home: A Short History of Private Life has been my companion for some weeks, but it's quite long. I'm happy with all my reading this year, some 32 books, many in a foreign language. Given I've no time to read during the day, and can only get some pages in after the kid's in bed, it's not too shabby. Oh, and we've read Stompysaurus, like, 90 times? Grawwwwr!

Here's some quotes to give you a feel: \"The smartphone is the electrical stunner in the slaughterhouse of society\" \"You’ll be able to access any TV or radio station in real time, around the world, talk to people overseas in high resolution video with live translations for free and be bored by it\" \"In the future the hermetic spaces of solitude will be breached as we build a global village. The private will become public and, ironically, the public will become private as the streets empty of experiences taken indoors, inside of bedrooms, beneath our screens of glowing grace.\" It's intentionally meant to be ambitious, brutal and challenging.

Here's my log for 2025, most recent at the top. Currently I am slogging my way through Heinlein's \"The Number of the Beast\" which I'm not a fan of. Halfway done with it though! Gabrielle Zevin, \"The Hole We're In\" (not my usual genre, enjoyed this though) Robert A. Heinlein, \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" (pretty good) Robert A. Heinlein, \"Time Enough for Love\" (PHENOMENAL, highly recommended) Robert A. Heinlein, \"Methuselah's Children\" (pretty good, required to understand \"Time Enough for Love\") Richard K. Morgan, \"Altered Carbon\" (very good) Robert A. Heinlein, \"The Rolling Stones\" (young adult, but good all the same) Robert A. Heinlein, \"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\" (very good) Piers Anthony, \"On A Pale Horse\" (very good, never got very far into the series though) Lincoln Child, \"Full Wolf Moon\" (okay, not great) Lincoln Child, \"The Forgotten Room\" (pretty good) Lincoln Child, \"The Third Gate\" (very good) Lincoln Child, \"Terminal Freeze\" (okay, not great) William Gibson, \"In the Beginning… Was the Command Line\" (good, but outdated, look up what he's said about it more recently) Lincoln Child, \"Deep Storm\" (very good) James Patterson, \"Along Came a Spider\" (not my usual genre, okay though) Jules Verne, \"Around the World in 80 Days\" (from childhood, revisited) reply",

Kindle app syncs between devices, and makes it easier to read a few pages here and there instead of waiting for uninterrupted sessions with my Kindle. 3. Continually updating a To Read list, mostly by going to Barnes and Noble, taking pictures of featured book tables, then adding the interesting ones to my Libby hold list. 4. Borrowing with Libby makes it easier to bail out of a book that doesn't intrigue me. Instead of forcing myself to finish something I spent $ on, I can just return it and move onto something else, feeling 0 guilt. reply",

          "text": "My reading is largely split between Sci-Fi and Australian crime fiction. So far this year I consumed 16 audiobooks and 68 ebooks. Given the Oz fiction would be a bit more unique to this audience, here are the highlights: The Fall Between and Burning Mountain by Darcy Tindale recount the investigations of main character Rebecca Giles. The Survivors by Jane Harper. Seriously, get any book or a shopping list written by Jane and you'll not be able to put it down. Mad Mabel by Sally Hepworth. Another author who's complete catalogue is well worth your time. Black River and Broke Road by Matthew Spencer. Unbury the Dead by Fiona Hardy. Other authors worth noting are Margaret Hickey, Chris Hammer and Christian White. On the sci-fi side of things, I found Infinite Archive by Mur Lafferty quite cozy. Also the Lady Astronauth Universe series by Mary Robinette Kowal, that starts with The Calculating Starts . Flybot by Dennis Taylor (of Bobbi-verse fame). I was less enamoured with A Memory Called Empire by Arkady Martine than others are, and don't feel the need to tackle the second in the series. I also revisited the John Cleaver horror series by Dan Wells that starts with the excellent I Am Not a Serial Killer . I've just started Slow Gods by Claire North. I find her books a bit hit and miss for me but so far, so good. I absolutely love The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August , and Touch was also quite good, but some of her others I could not finish or didn't event start as they were just not for me. reply",

          "text": "My top book of the year: Fryderyk Chopin: A Life and Times , Alan Walker A riveting read by a legendary musicologist and biographer.  Walker spent about ten years researching this.  It is 700 pages, which seems daunting but he makes this authoritative bio absolutely enjoyable.  It's also a \"corrective biography\", it dispels a lot of myths.  This book is one of the best examples of accessible writing with flair.  What a writer! Throughout the book, Walker tastefully quotes musical phrases (in notation) from Chopin's works to situate them in context.  I often paused reading and put on the track on a given page (nocturnes, mazurkas, preludes, etc).  It made the reading experience incredibly rich and fun.  Other things I enjoyed: Chopin's letters to his friends and family, life in aristocratic salons of Paris, London, Warsaw, and more—Chopin had unparalleled access.  Of course, there's also a lot of gut-wrenching stuff.  As the book's blurb says, it really is for both the casual music lover and the professional pianist. If you haven't discovered them yet, give a listen to Chopin's nocturnes.  But please, give them an attentive listen and play them on a high-quality audio system.  Here[1] is one of his finest nocturnes (it is less famous than the \"happier\" nocturne that follows it, Op. 9 No. 2).

          "text": "\"Brief Cases\" -- just give me more Dresden. I think my favourite series, I'm a simple guy :) Short stories themself are so and so. If you are into the series then these small stories are just like Saturday evening reading, so no big investment. Some of them stick and make you warm, some of them meh, thats ok. \"Mother of Learning\" I picked up from my (ex-)colleague. Not in the time-travelling, but he told me that I would probably like Dungeon Crawler Carl. Haven't gotten to it yet. He's read more fantasy than me so he just suggested after we discussed about our preferences. This one I just wanted to read because he really was into :) About Fitz -- read my other comment. I think whole Elderling series is worth it. It is the long game. Just being invested in characters and Robin Hobb can write characters. If you only think about Farseer trilogy, then I still think it's worth it, but maybe I'm just sucker for it. :-) (there are pacing issues for sure, but Hobb wrote it in 90s, in that sense it was ahead of time, forgive some of those small issues). Read it first I guess 20+ years ago or so.. reply",

That type of content drives brand and product hype via views/engagement, helps you filter ideas (if your vlog is getting no traction, maybe not a great product?) and avoids promotional post rules in a lot of communities. My new years resolution is to dial in my content driven development pipeline. reply",

Devs have very good BS radar and \"hype\" is sometimes all there is in a lot of content. I see and hear a lot of the \"build in public\" being promoted as the way to do things with the \"build an audience\" mantra. There is a huge hurdle to produce good video content, it takes a lot of time to record, edit and publish quality videos. Publishing quality videos can help get traction/views/subscribers but that doesn't mean it will translate into paying customers either. Do people really want to watch software developers code or talk about it? There has to be other ways to market a product. reply",

          "text": "There are some hacks to make video content easier: 1. Just do split screen videos where you talking head with slides on the other, and read off the slides. 2. Record in segments, with a full reset between each segment. Makes editing really fast. 3. Don't stress about small mistakes. People are into authenticity, it's ok. Lighting/\"studio\" design is still an art, but you can get something set up in a day or two. The harder part is coming up with good video ideas, and doing a compelling title/thumbnail/hook. That's a rabbit hole. If you have a social media following you can leverage that. Cold calls can work if you're selling big ticket items, but you also need to be good at sales and do a lot of legwork so I wouldn't go down that route. I wouldn't start advertising until you can demonstrate product market fit. reply",

I'm not the target audience clearly, but this seems like a mechanical, low sophistication task, why don't I just use gemini or whatever to do this for free? If I already pay $20/month for any LLM that's multi modal I can do this now already. The asset (animated doodles) doesn't really connect me to how I'm going to get a better click through rate.

Not quite an oxymoron but certainly a puzzlement. Maybe, generously, in retrospect, an aspiration? I never considered myself an actual engineer; I was (and still am) a self-taught un-credentialed computer programmer. More art than science. They made me take the title and the stock options and the business cards. I mostly worked for and with EEs, making software tools for test automation. I was a fanboy hardware wannabee (and still am), got some on me but was never a true engineer. I learned from those who practiced their discipline; it was plain to me the reality of real engineering versus what I was doing. I suppose in my travels I have on occasion encountered a true Software Engineer. I suppose there's reason to hope that software development will continue to mature and evolve, and eventually the other engineering disciplines will accept software as a science. For me, it will always be a joy to make that hardware work with my twiddly bits. Not engineering, no. But very rewarding work that often resembles engineering. reply",

          "text": "Funny you should mention this, I just added a simple filesystem sandbox to my coding agent. Check it out: https://github.com/jacobsparts/agentlib/blob/main/src/agentl... The framework is all python, but I used C for this helper.  It uses unprivileged user namespaces to mount an overlay and run an arbitrary command, then when the command finishes, it writes a tarball of edits, which I use to create a unified diff.  The framework orchestrates it all transparently, but the helper itself could be used standalone.  Here's a short document about the sandbox in the context of it's use in my project: https://github.com/jacobsparts/agentlib/blob/main/docs/sandb... I also have a version that uses SUID instead of unprivileged user namespaces, available by request. I often use claude code with --dangerously-skip-permissions but every once in a while it bites me.  I've learned to use git for everything and put instructions to always commit BEFORE writes in CLAUDE.md.  Claude can go off the rails on harder bug fixes, especially if there are multiple rounds of context compacting, it can really screw things up.  It usually honors guidance not to modify outside of the project, but a simple sandbox adds so much, after the session is over you can see what changed and decide what to do with it.  It really helps with the problem where it makes unexpected changes to the codebase, which you might not even notice otherwise, which can introduce serious bugs.  The permission models of all the coding agents are rough--either you can't get anything done, or you throw caution to the wind.  Full sandboxes are quite restrictive, which is why I rolled by own.  Honestly your best option right now is just to have good version control and run coding agents in dedicated environments. reply",

It's a 2 player jumping game where you collect stars and bounce off clouds to rack up the highest score before time runs out. Players manage an energy bar to jump, land on clouds for super bounces, and you can throw bombs at each other to steal points and cause chaos. Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no dependencies, ~1000 lines in a single file. The kids designed the characters (Kirby and Kee Kee) and we had a blast playtesting together... tweaking cloud bounce physics, adding a tie screen for when scores match, bumping bombs from 3 to 5. Kid-driven game design is so much fun. Try it here: https://kirby-sky-jumpers.mfelixstudio.workers.dev Controls: WASD + L-Shift (P1) / Arrows + R-Shift (P2) Please give us some feedback on how to improve! reply",

So if you were going to build a competitor, you'd need to get everyone who has built a profile on linkedin and built a 20 year rolodex of their network to all migrate away. I'm not saying it cannot happen, I'm saying it is not a tech problem, so building a new flavor of the same app and hoping it wins out is an even higher-risk bet than most startups, and therefore does not fall into most people's risk tolerances. reply",

You can (and should!) ignore it and not miss out on anything. Make a profile. Update it occasionally when you're job searching. Forget about the site until you need it. Hit the unsubscribe button when they e-mail you suggestions. The exception is people who simply cannot resist getting pulled into a feed and scrolling it. If that's you, I understand why you'd stay off of the website. For everyone else, it's a set it and forget it until you need it kind of website. That's also why a second website isn't appealing to anyone. They've already gotten past the set-and-forget part.

Once enough people join, we can launch our own open feed that connects directly to the people you follow. No need for the big platforms at all. You pull updates straight from their sites in real time and move freely without losing your content or your audience. It reuses the network effects we already have while giving you true ownership and independence.

You're right that it's used differently for finding candidates, but I still don't engage with the feed. At most I've posted that I have a job opening as a post (not a job listing). The problem is that it's heavily biased toward people who spend a lot of time on LinkedIn scrolling the feed, which in my experience isn't the most positive signal for people you want to hire to focus on your work. Similar story for hiring people who spend all day posting on any social media: They tend to be distracted by their social media fixation and it's hard to keep them focused on work communications instead of their current online argument. reply",

It's deadlock, for every thread you care about.  (2) Automation in job applications and a declining job market have both made networking more essential, so there's no tolerance for lost connections, so you'd also have to solve those problems too before all would switch.  (3)  Even if users don't like it and could surmount the coordination costs of switching, if companies continue to rely on it, switching would be a career-limiting move; and because companies cannot signal their recruitment strategies without triggering a stampede to game their system, companies tend to keep quiet, so no company would lead an exodus. Still, no one (outside influencers) likes how work networking and recruitment happens today, so user might do both linkedin and some new system if one created a more effective networking and recruitment mode (e.g., for some well-defined, high-value subset, like recent Stanford MBA's, YC alumni, FinTech, ...). reply",

So once LinkedIn stops providing the value that gives it its dominance, and/or someone finds a way to deliver more value, you'll see your competition. That's your answer. Seemingly nobody has found a good enough angle or opportunity, And FWIW, sure the network effect is hard to replace, but not even close to impossible. Just ask the dozens of other social networks that have fallen from greatness.

There is no need for a contender because Linkedin is a poorly thought solution to an ill addressed problem.

          "text": "Why is there strong competition for every other social media site? This seems to come down to a few market dynamics:\n1. The major influencers who adopt it and bring their followers\n2. New networks bring new leaderboards which attract the next generation that has zero equity on the existing sites\n3. Regular engagement is critical, otherwise every network faces a death spiral\n4. Engagement required to drive ad revenue LinkedIn is notable for not being affected by these:\n1. There are no major influencers (though they tried.) The most influential person on LinkedIn is very close in value to the median software engineer\n2. There are no significant leaderboards (though they tried.) Few people care how many followers others have\n3. Regular engagement doesn't matter, because it is still the Schelling point for irregular life events (ie needing a job.) \n4. Most of their revenue comes from subscriptions for recruiters, so the lower engagement is not an existential crisis. LinkedIn is an always-on jobs expo pretending to be social media. Even the executives think they are social media. They are actually something else. Some angles to compete:\n1. Build better data for an underserved segment. Obvious choice is SWE, but MSFT owns Github as a firewall here. Another candidate is the top 1% of executives: they might be the major influencers that haven't been activated yet.\n2. Build an identity layer that mitigates risk of fake job seekers. LinkedIn has halfheartedly tried this but their inertia might be an opportunity.\n3. Build the Github for other segments: the verifiable portfolios that show real work. \n4. Build a frontrunner to the hiring pipeline. If every star candidate can be identified three months before they start looking on LinkedIn, the recruiting system there will fall apart. \n5. Build the workplace social media network that users actually want to use daily. LinkedIn failed at this, and their effort indicates they see the risk of disruption coming from here. Some existing companies that are on the right track:\n1. Slack. Already owns DAU for work, well-funded, competes with MSFT in many domains. 30% confident they've considered moving into this space, but Benioff getting AI-pilled will slow it down.\n2. Behance. Owned the market for designers, sold to Adobe, game over.\n2. Glassdoor. Useful data that LinkedIn doesn't own, but they seem to have embraced the Yelp business model instead.\n3. Fishbowl. Daily engagement solved but they've backed into a local maxima.\n4. Upwork. Stuck with low-end brand that will prevent them from winning this market.\n5. X. Has all the pieces except for a leader who cares about a jobs board. Would need a certain kind of leader for their jobs product to get it to win.\n6. Every other talent startup: fighting for the right revenue, but they almost always approach it from the transactional staffing model or the ATS subscription model. Would need someone to buy all of them up and launch a network with 100M profiles on day one. reply",

          "text": "Not a bug but rather an engineering oversight. Also not hard and it did not affect me, I caught it soon, but it was one of those surprising moments worth mentioning. I have a write-online table in MariaDB and ordering of records is important. I have realised that the database has no such thing as append-only table that stores records in the order they are submitted into the database. Every record has one or more indices, and it is these indices that dictate the ordering and only for the data they index. What I have overlooked is when a transaction A starts, then transaction B starts, the transaction A might have records with smaller keys, as it started sooner, but transaction B commits first with higher keys, which means I end up with out-of-order entries. This is not too bad, actually, it depends on the context and in my case the context was that there were readers constantly waiting for new records. And so if a reader reads records after transaction B commits but not before transaction A commits, the reader will never see new records from transaction A. I have solved it by blocking the readers based on number of active transactions with ordering being considered. I have wrote about it in this blog post, in the \"Event Log and proper ordering of events\" section https://gethly.com/blog/how-of-gethly/event-sourcing-right-w... reply",

          "text": "Not exactly a bug, but I was given a company written video player that receives a video stream, decodes it via the browser WebCodecs API, and renders via WebGL. Users complained that video was laggy and often froze on their iPhones. My task was to make it perform better - using the browser's built-in player wasn't an option. After profiling, I found two bottlenecks: converting frames to RGB was happening on the CPU and was quite costly, so I rendered the decoded YUV frames directly on the GPU without conversion. Second, I moved all logic off the main thread since our heavy UI was competing for the same resources. The main thread thing was that I was iterating through the frame buffer multiple times per second to select the appropriate frame for rendering. When heavy UI animations occurred, the main thread would block, causing the iteration to complete late - by then, the target frame's timestamp had passed, so it would get skipped and only the next frame would be drawn, creating visible stuttering. reply",

          "text": "Muslim majority country here (Malaysia). Christmas day is a public holiday, and so is New Year's. It's also the end of the year when most people want to use up their paid time off. Nobody likes having a holiday on two Thursdays followed by work on Friday. Nor do we want to encourage people to carry vacation days to the next year. So we're happy to take the bulk time off at least, and it gives time for people to arrange school paperwork. It is technically a sin in Islam to celebrate other religious holidays. Heck, if you want to go deep into the dogma, everything besides the two Eids shouldn't be celebrated and that includes Prophet Muhammad's birthday and New Year's. But you'll see very heated debates about this that I won't go into. Christmas lies in a weird place on this spectrum. Some say Abrahamic holidays are fine, some say most 'Islamic' holidays are blasphemy. People argue about the Santa hats too. However, Christmas food is perfectly halal. Turkey, peppermint, non-alcoholic egg nog, various desserts. You'll see \"end of year\" dinners by Muslim restaurants that cater to this. Culturally, many of us do have Christian family and friends. So it is a convenient time to meet family and just have an excuse to cook complex Western dishes once a year. Gift giving is rare. You'll see secret Santa stuff at the workplace and in schools. 90% of people in the region do not have disposable income, so expensive gifts are frowned on, as they create pressure. Most are under $25, like fancy soap, snacks, chocolate, a power bank. There's also a culture where charity should be hidden, so stuff usually gets put in a box with no names and the boxes are pseudorandomly distributed. reply",

          "text": "I was a little steamed when my son came home from school with a pamphlet about winter festivals which listed all of them except for the astronomically correct one that us pagans celebrate. On the other hand, the Christian (apocryphal) idea that hope came into the world on the (almost) darkest day of the year is beautiful to me.  As well as the idea that some ancient Hebrews miraculously survived in a cave. I also like the idea that the celebrations start with advent like they do in Germany or that there are “12 days of Christmas” ending with the epiphany,  which is a real astronomical event which is part of the explanation of why Christians celebrate the day that they do.

Yes, I know slaves must be set free after seven years. That doesn’t suddenly make it okay and it’s painful to watch people use that as a justification. > technological achievements of the last centuries Christians love to claim these advancements for themselves as long as it fits their story. Much of our mathematical advancements come from the Muslim world. And plenty of scientists that changed the world were under prosecution of Christianity. But it is convenient that a doctor (who has spent years learning about the human body) can remove your bad gallbladder then attributing it to your god. Unless you’re a type of Christian that doesn’t believe in surgery, then it’s “of the devil”. > without risk of being scalped alive? Well, as long as you’re not a Palestinian trying to survive a genocide that is in part supported by fundamentalist Christians on the other side of the planet. Frankly, your comment reeks of “white Jesus saved the world” or what many might refer to as racism. Your example of scalping really, really gives you away. reply",

          "text": "Christma$$ is so very commercial. Jesus’ message is universally ignored, based on actions, and in fact the entire world economy is based on the seven deadly sins. [0] You wouldn’t want people to destroy the world economy by being devout, would you? Pride, Greed, Envy, Lust, Anger, Gluttony, Laziness. \nFrom the cited article: > Pride. Pride is the will to omnipotence. It’s the greatest of sins, and yet it’s everywhere: big business and the elites impose their rules on the world, new technologies are increasingly transgressive (AI, transhumanism, space conquest, etc.), skyscrapers are being built ever taller, etc. In one way or another, the biggest companies reflect this pride. > Greed. Greed is the excessive attachment to money, and the contemporary economy is based on the constant quest for profit. The accumulation of wealth, tax havens and excessive speculation are all modern forms of greed. > Envy. Envy is a deep-seated vice: it means wanting what someone else has. These days, marketing and advertising constantly make us dream of other people’s lives, in a competition where everyone tries to compare themselves, without ever being satisfied with what they are and what they have. In particular, social networking platforms … > Anger.  But the modern economy, by creating the best and the worst, generates inhuman inequalities that arouse anger in everyone. > Lust. Lust is the immoderate pursuit of sexual desire. The MindGeek company, which brings together the major platforms of the pornographic industry, including YouPorn, Pornhub, etc., is enjoying worldwide success. > Gluttony. Gluttony, as we all know, is not a passing fancy. It’s a compulsive need for food pleasure. As the modern economy constantly pushes us to consume, it also pushes those who can afford it to eat non-stop… > Laziness. Finally, laziness is not just weariness. It is the refusal of physical, moral and intellectual effort. There you go. We are creating tools that even think for us. So, only a few among us actually believe in the child’s message, and behave accordingly, (actions count, really they do) or at least try to. :-) [0] https://julienchevalier.com/en/the-economy-of-the-7-deadly-s... reply",

          "text": "If you follow HN over the course of 24 hours, you’ll see at least 3 major waves. I tend to have an odd sleep schedule, so I’m always amused when I’m online to see which group is currently active. There is an Asian/Australian wave, followed by Europe, and the North America. Some of the best times are when the waves start to mix (ex: early morning NYC time, you’ll get the Europe and NA groups interacting). You’ll see different types of stories posted. Similar enough to where it all makes sense to be on HN, but it seems like a different flavor. But the comments are where I start to see more differences. You can get new takes on the same article if you see the comments from different times of the day. This doesn’t take into account the total numbers of people active from each region, which I suspect is skewed towards more users the US coasts. But, it does, I think, speak to how US centric HN is. I think it serves the needs each of the waves in a distinct way. In many ways, this is just an extension of the weekend HN effect. You can clearly observe differences on the site over the weekends. So, to me, it is unsurprising that you’d find differences across time zones. I’d love to actually see this analyzed more. This is just the take from someone who has been awake at enough hours to observe some anecdotal trends. reply",

Today, it happened to my family.<p>My mother received a call from a scammer. They told her she needed to process some tax issue and prove that her bank account had enough money. In just a few minutes, they tricked her and manipulated her into entering banking OTP codes. All of her savings are now gone.<p>What makes this more dramatic is that last year I architected and helped a government department in my country build a big system. This system can track money flows across the whole country, to know where money comes from. I was very proud of this. It is the biggest achievement of my life. Even if nobody knows I built it, that was fine.<p>But now I cannot protect my own mother. I cannot protect my family. My system can track the money, but it is almost impossible to get it back.<p>When I went to the police, just in one small area, there were more than 20 cases in a single day. A hardworking student sent all their family's money, thinking it was for university fees or going abroad. An old factory worker lost all her retirement savings. So many people lost everything. That is when I realized that the system I built, the system I was proud of, is not enough.<p>All my own savings are gone too. (My mother was scammed into borrowing a lot of money and sending it to the scammers, and now it is my responsibility.) I had plans for the next few years: to do open source work, to write books about math and programming, to create a dream Go web framework, to give back to the community. Now all of that is gone.<p>But this is not only about me. I can still start over. I am strong enough to rebuild my life. But who will protect people like my mother? Or a poor student? Or a factory worker? Or so many others?<p>I can build systems. I can build distributed systems that scale to a whole country. But for what? What should I do?<p>I have been reading Hacker News for 12 to 13 years, sometimes posting from other accounts. I am writing here now to ask for advice and help from this community.<p>If anyone has experience with similar cases, or ideas on what can realistically be done, or even advice on how to move forward after something like this, I would really appreciate it. I will keep this account semi-private, because with the details above, I think some engineers from my country may recognize me.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

They can even trick a person into selling expensive property (real estate) and then steal the money. One thing is the government must act. These calls are mostly done from abroad. Phone companies can implement some protective measures. Banks too need to watch for common patterns (doesn't always help because scammers talk the victim around the checks). The society as a whole needs to get aware. What a single person could do is to keep contact with the relatives. I've read an expert report on one such case; the author wrote that even a single close someone could break the trance and stop the scam. In that case the victim happened to be a popular singer seemingly never alone, yet as it turned out she actually was a lone old lady with not a single confidant close enough for more than a month. She was, of course, shattered with what happened (she lost close to $3M), but after some time in one if her interviews she said: \"I will survive\". She said it in Russian and did not comment on the phrase further, it must be too personal. Yet of course she meant that song. The song helps her. The song's story is different, but the emotion is same. We have all our love to give. A hard hit will do good if it makes us to commit on that. reply",

Literally her defenses were \"the buyer should've known this deal was suspect due to below the market price\" and that the buyer should have asked for a health report from a psychiatrist (wtf). Not a nice old lady after all. I haven't been following the case closely, but it seems like the decision has been overturned. Similar to Streisand Effect, there's now in Russia the term Dolina Effect [0] after this singer, referring to these \"grandma schemes\" where criminals direct the elderly to sell their property and then renege, relying on courts siding with them to keep the property and the money. Whatever the real story is, it's all so messed up. [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolina_effect reply",

The person on the screen can look and sound real. The conversation feels natural and authoritative. For many people, especially older relatives, it is almost impossible to tell that it is fake. This is no longer about obvious scam messages or bad phone calls. AI is making scams feel personal and trustworthy. Please warn your families. No bank or authority will ever ask for OTP codes or urgent transfers, even if it is a video call and the person looks real. reply",

          "text": "Sorry to hear this. From where I am (India), there’s hardly anything that you can do because it’s likely that the ones with power won’t do anything. As an individual, you can only focus on yourself and those you know and try to educate them as much as is possible. These kind of scams have become a huge problem in India (look up “digital arrest” scams). People of all backgrounds and age groups have lost a lot of money (to put it in US dollar equivalent amounts, imagine a person losing few hundred thousand dollars to a couple of million dollars). There is nothing like “digital arrest” in Indian laws. The government has tried to warn people about this. The larger problem seems to be a combination of factors across disinterested entities: 1. The police aren’t interested in solving these (there’s a separate division for cybercrime). Filing a formal report is usually thwarted and avoided by the police. Even if they show some interest, it always involves paying them fat sums of money. There’s no guarantee that they can recover the money. 2. The banks aren’t interested in solving this. It seems like specific bank branch managers are involved and just stand by allowing large transactions (like cash withdrawals) to just be approved without raising any questions or concerns. All the talk by banks about “risk management” (alongside compliance matters) goes out the window just for the victims of these scams. 3. With SMS OTPs being common and the scammers recruiting some locals to run SIM farms/phone farms, the telecom companies aren’t interested in solving issues within themselves either. Though there is a limit of nine phone numbers (total) per person in India, and though there is on paper a KYC process (including a live video) to get a phone number, the telecom companies have systems and employees who can provide numerous numbers based on stolen or fake IDs. 4. The government is a bystander and appears helpless. Instead of creating laws and enforcing existing laws, it focuses on some awareness that these scams are not genuine. 5. The Supreme Court finally ordered CBI (the Indian equivalent of FBI) to investigate these scams. So there you have it: none of the entities involved has any interest or will to do something about the problem. There will always be excuses that the scammers are in another country. reply",

The best thing you can do is help to educate people, maybe create an organization that can work with other organizations to target youth and senior knowledge.  Before they passed both my grandmothers had seen many similar scam efforts that targeted them.  One of my grandmothers was way too knowledgeable and crafty to fall for it, even pleas like, \"Grandma, I'm in jail and need help...\" absolutely failed in practice.  For better or worse, my other Grandmother had been scammed a couple times and towards the end of her life didn't have the finances to scam any more from, living with my mom and her sisters. Unfortunately the scams themselves range from amazingly complex to what should be really easy to spot.  I make it a rule to NEVER give personal information to someone that calls me unexpectedly, at least nothing that isn't already effectively public information. Annoying when your doctor's office has an automated system that calls and the first thing it does is ask for your social security number...  My response is \"nope, not doing it\" and that's what I told anyone that would listen at that office every visit... it's training people to get scammed. reply",

No legitimate organization needs full, permanent control over your bank account. If a situation feels incredibly urgent, it is almost certainly a scam. • Taxes?

They basically \"waste the scammers time\".  The scams rely on low effort ways to find the target, robocalls, emails, etc.  But once the target is found they have to put real effort into implementation.  With AI, this will only become easier on their end. I would look into solutions that would make it harder for them.  Like AI chatbots that act like targets, both text and voice.  If the majority of their efforts end up being weeks of conversation with an AI before they figure it out then it will not be worth the effort. Right now it may take them hours to find a viable target then days to extort them.  Make it take longer, until it is more lucrative to get a legitimate job. I used to think it was fun to mess with scammers... but I think these days many of them are forced into it.  Basically they are lured in with reasonable sounding job offers then once they find themselves in another country with only their \"employer\" look out for them, they basically become slave labor. You need to hurt the ones trapping the slaves that run the scams, and your weapon is the same as theirs... technology. reply",

I got really emotional but then after reading it, I saw it was a generic threat and nothing could be done. You are asking, what can be done? Start with the basics, strong password and MFA everywhere. Avoided pirated Windows, and if you can avoid the OS entirely as well. Basic cybersecurity awareness need to be taught in schools.

Truth be told that scamming is becoming easier and easier. The problem is that most countries not only allow it, it is part of their GDP. Look at the number of scammers that originate in India. Everyone there knows who they are, there are numerous YouTube channels souly dedicated to exposing them and reporting them to the authorities, yet they still remain active. Until a more brutal and direct response is used, these organizations and countries will continue to operate. If the attacks Trump has used on drug boats has taught us anything is that a direct response is the best response when dealing with the underworld. reply",

          "text": "(If you're OP: this is not a solution per se but more of a generalist rant; just so you don't waste critical time) People talk about changing laws or technical solutions, but the inconvenient truth is that technically literate people should peer-pressure nearby friends/family/etc. into being more aware of such possibilities. I've done so, to the extent that some people find it ether borderline schizophrenic/paranoid (to my \"luck\", I live in an ex-communist country, where most people are usually skeptical in many contexts with strangers; so this group of people is relatively small). People who know better bear a responsibility towards helping others who don't; towards those who are too kind (or naive) for their own good; Even though I'm the \"tech guy\" in my close circles (family, friends,etc.) like many here, I often do the >opposite< of what other \"pro-technologists\" do these days: I don't encourage people, especially the older generation OR the more tech-illiterate ones to use more technology, because it is obvious that doing so \"injects\" another vector of attacks into their lives. More often these days this is not possible, everything gets digitalized to the detriment of such groups, but this also delves into the politics of keeping \"older options\" (cash, paper trails, etc.) available even if digitalization happens. Often times the older options are more secure, though obviously less convenient. This is a non-solution, yes, but it is the correct way to approach this (imo), as more and more places LEGALLY force digitalization of different institutions(banking, gov. agencies, etc.)  which inherently either add, or worse, completely shift the risk into virtual spaces. This is why a \"legal\" solution is more often than not either a slow one or a completely pointless one. It will always be an arms-race between scammers(which operate more effectively[in theory] due to their decentralized nature) and the gov./banks/etc., which operate in a more centralized fashion, thus demanding and imposing more control above all included parties. A legal way will always demand more than it's worth. I digress from my shift into politics, but bottom line is this: don't let your peers/family/closed ones get into these situations. If you have \"an authoritative\" voice regarding tech, use it to first cultivate awareness regarding dangers, before cultivating hype/or anything else. (Obviously not talking about anyone specifically, but the whole \"geeksphere\" as a whole) Good luck to you and your family. reply",

          "text": "From the author of Redis on MicroQuickJS[1]: > If this had been available in 2010, Redis scripting would have been JavaScript and not Lua. With that in mind we can do a quick search to see how Lua is used. I found an article on Wikipedia titled \"List of applications using Lua\"[2]. Of course that's not an exhaustive list but it gives you a bit of an idea. Off the top of my head, the places I've personally seen Lua used: 1. modifying DNS responses in PowerDNS 2. neovim plugins 3. video game mods like Factorio Personally I got into programming by writing shell scripts. I never studied computer science or IT. Instead it was the ability to write basic code for existing software that gave me this accidental introduction to the world of writing logic down as a set of machine-readable instructions. For me, MicroQuickJS is another one of those ways for \"power users\" (who may themselves be professional software developers) to extend some existing software without getting into the nitty gritty of the big bad upstream dev project.

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I am a college student and for my entire life I have been lonely. This is probably taken a very heavy toll on my mental health but that’s another story. I’ve never been able to make friends and keep meaningful connections that last a long time. In fact I’d go as far as saying I have never had a friend, and I currently don’t have any. My phone is empty, when I go to school nobody talks to me and when I do find people who seem to have some kind of interest in me, it usually doesn’t last very long since they don’t prioritize whatever we have. As far as I’m aware I am tolerable to be around. People find me funny and when I do talk to people we have decent conversations (though small talk tends to bore me). However that doesn’t lead anywhere and doesn’t bring me any kind of comfort or fulfillment. I’ve attributed my lack of friends to something that places all the blame on me. Maybe I’m ugly, maybe I’m not funny enough, maybe I’m dumb. I don’t know if that’s the right approach. But I’ve tried so many different things, I’ve read so many different books and yet I still can’t get anyone to even bother to ask me how my day was or care to actually do something and hang out with me when I ask if they’d like too.<p>What am I supposed to do? Be lonely and without any kind of company and human connection my entire life?</p></div>",

          "text": "If I may be so bold, the fallacy here is of time. Dare I say, you are already surrounded by friends, and not noticing it. It seems like you measure \"friendship\" not by the time spent with them when you go to events or in school, but what happens afterwards. In other words, you are discounting to zero the moments that are actually happening in your life, for an imagined future of what a friendship might turn out to be. But life only ever happens moment to moment. That time that you spend with people at an event, that IS the thing. There is no \"friendship certificate\": some people, you'll only spend ten minutes with; some, you might spend an afternoon with; others you might end up seeing once a week for a term. You might date a girl for a fortnight, or a couple of months, and then break up and never see each other again. It's ALL GOOD. If I understand correctly, none of the above would qualify in your eyes as \"real friendship\", only the deep, deep kind. You might find it helpful to learn about Dunbar's number, and the size of the model's concentric social circles. Most people end up with 1-2 very close friends (possibly including their spouse). That is the outcome over a lifetime of making connections. Popular culture markets this idea that we should all be carousing with a tightly knit group of friends - no statistical social evidence bears this out. When sinking into deep analysis about all your self-perceived inadequacies, your attention beam is directed inwards. That's unhealthy. When it's directed OUT, into the world, it takes you out of your head, and lets you see that everyone, every single one (person or otherwise), is struggling in their own way. Everyone's got a thing. Looking out builds empathy and kindness and affection towards things that make you happy, and gazing inwards makes you miserable. You are surrounded by people in school, and are at a stage in life where you get to be interested in whatever. Any experience you have, even if it doesn't lead to lifelong friendships, is worthy in the space of time it occupies. Throughout my undergrad I had friends come and go. I'm not in touch with anyone I met at Uni during those years.  It doesn't make the actual time spent with these people any less special. reply",

Judging from these descriptions: > I’m socially anxious and keep to myself > small talk tends to bore me > it’s exhausting always having to text them to hang out, if I don’t then we never talk again It's highly possible that you have undiagnosed autism spectrum disorder. I say this because I am reading a book right now about ASD[0] and a lot of this is ringing true, especially the part about being confused why friends are dropping you. Speak to a psychologist and see what they think (or read the book first, and then speak to them). I am 30 now and am just cluing in that I might be on the spectrum, and oh boy do I wish I had caught it when I was younger. (It's also possible that you don't have ASD but some other condition like avoidant personality disorder, but whatever it is, it is so much easier to solve it once you've figured it out.)

The more needy you are and craving for attention the more unattractive and uninteresting you look as a person. The only solution for these types of problems (aside of usual phychotherapy/physiology that you need to rule out first with help of professionals!) - is to genuinely stop giving a single damn whether you're alone or not. Right after that moment you will become much much more attractive as a person. And you will release a ton of energy to focus on things that are more important (like your life goals etc). But you can't fool yourself and pretend that you don't care while still being worried about the outcomes inside. It's not \"fake it till you make it\" type of inner game. That is a key to your problem (after you solved main mommy/daddy issues if any with a decent therapist). No amount of shallow \"be yourself, be interested in others\" advice will help until you have a foundation to be congruent in these tactical actions.

          "text": "A lot of advice of what you should do, putting the burden on action which is likely to worsen your depression and self-worth image. So let me offer an alternative, healthier way of dealing with discomfort, especially of the soul: the first step is accepting the situation and making the best of it. Issues of loneliness aren't easily solved by joining the church or the cricket club, despite many comments along those lines; it's good to realise that loneliness sticks with us and gets more painful when around people. You won't ever feel so lonely as in a crowd. There is a difference between loneliness and solitude. Learn solitude. Learn to be comfortable with yourself. Know yourself, and chances are, you don't have a clue about yourself at 19, and you probably won't be for a few more decades of self-reflection, so get started. Then, when you'll find comfort in yourself, comfort in being by yourself, joy even, you'll be ready to face that door that is the cause of your great sadness today. And you'll come from a place where companionship is no more a matter of life-and-death, but from a more mature position that understand that people come and go, might love you and might hurt you, but the only constant source of joy, respite and calm lies within you, and it's been there all along. I'm not sure any of this would've made any sense to my 19 years old self, but no one sat down to explain this to me either, so I hope it strikes a chord. Just don't blame yourself for an ill society where connection is ever harder. -- a fellow lonely person that found joy in solitude, appreciating those heartfelt, fleeting moments with worthy humans. reply",

Also, as Charlie Munger always said: \"Invert! Invert! Invert!\". Try doing the opposite of what you normally do. This requires of course paying attention to what you normally do (or don't do). Instead of waiting for others to reach out to you, for example, you might instead approach them. Be okay with the fear of rejection. When we are kids we make friends so easily because we haven’t yet learned to protect ourselves from rejection. An interesting exercise I had to do recently as part of a teambuilding exercise: offer a hug to 5 random  strangers. I promise this will teach you something about yourself, and about others. reply",

I see some straight up bad advice being given in here (being obsessed with finding relationships, which is human need does not perpetuate the problem, it is a biological drive to solve it) And some good advice: Be genuinely curious about others. Really listen to them. Look in their eyes when they are talking to you and when you are talking to them. (This has done wonders for me in trying to build community!) For me personally, being christian has helped a little (church ends up being a source of community). Is there any spiritual or religious practice you could find a place of worship to be around others who share your belief with? I'm not trying to impose my faith, but rather my practice of being around those who share my core beliefs. Another thing that really really helped me was getting over my preoccupation with older friends. My closest friend is 30 years older than me. Literally my dad's age.

          "text": "+1e9, should be the top answer IMO. Activities create a group of people with a common interest, meeting regularly. You have a ready supply of people with something in common, you meet them regularly enough to create a bond, and easy ways to engage with them outside of class (\"hey people who attend activity X, shall we do some activity X outside of classes?\"). If you're not very sporty, less sporty things include: - photography - dancing classes (esp if you're a man, IME they are usually in short supply for classes) - hiking / walking groups - book clubs / chess / bridge - quirky sports like roller skating Otherwise, what other say. Other people like being listened to (and their interlocutor remembering what you said to them), that's an accessible trick to bond with people. And finally, it sounds like you don't struggle to build acquaintances - so maybe the tricky bit is \"converting\" them into friendships. I'd say, in case it makes you feel better, that this is very much the common experience, to varying degrees, and the cult of people having lots and lots of friends is, for most, commercial propaganda. reply",

I think it's very important that you fight the urge to attribute your loneliness to anything intrinsic to who you are as a person. You don't need to be pretty, funny, or smart to make friends and have meaningful, deep relationships. Like seriously, it's extremely important to understand that it really doesn't have anything to do with you. One mistake I made when I was in university was have a baseline assumption that I was unlikable or similarly flawed, hence I would always find reasons why someone disliked me and pushed them away as a defence mechanism. Regardless of if it's true it's a horribly unproductive mindset to have and I encourage you to fight it. Also you won't make friends by reading books. It's tempting to overanalyse but human connection isn't something you learn by reading, you learn it by doing it. A bunch. Go travel and see the world. reply",

          "text": "Most people are not the ones initiating a hangout with others who they aren't yet friends with, they usually join in when invited if it fits their schedule/they are bored, etc. I'd recommend trying to brush off a bit the feeling of rejection since you don't have these connections yet. It sucks a bit but knowing it's completely normal might help you not feel it's something personal against you. My recommendation is to keep trying with the ones you felt you could potentially click, I also have ADHD but never had much of an issue to make friends, and never made it a \"goal\", I just kept getting interested in people and would try to meet them again, most times it fizzles out even though you can have a nice time together but eventually some people stick around and become friends over time :) Also try to have a well defined event, and be genuine, do things you like and try to invite people you met with these shared interests, in a casual and friendly way, people are more prone to join in when they don't feel there's pressure to do it. I think the 3 first points of this comment [0] touch very much on the core of it, if you can strengthen against the feeling of rejection, and learn to be open and vulnerable (while balancing it to not become oversharing) it can go a long way to make people see and connect with you. Almost everyone is \"in the closet\" somehow, putting up a mask, when people meet someone that shows less of a mask and more themselves they usually will find those interesting.

Look, there are definitely people out there who are your type and you’d be great friends. It’s just you have to keep putting yourself out there until you ‘find’ or ‘attract’ the right kind of people.\nParticipate in events, be a part of communities. It won’t happen if you consciously try.

It can perpetuate itself despite your effort. I heard a saying once that is a hard truth that stuck with me. “If you want to be loved, be loveable.” Take stock of yourself and your confidence. Choose some areas for growth and accomplishment that you can get after independently. You’re in college so it’s a great time to build yourself with intention. For example, learn to play music. Get into a sport. Find your interests and get after them with gusto. Skills and interests will give opportunity for connection not just with people but with yourself. You can be so much more than you are today. reply",

          "text": "I'm not sure what help my \"advice\" is going to be so I'll start with a little context. I'm near 50 and have basically zero friends. I have colleagues and acquaintances who I get along with. I'm also married with children. I always found it hard to make and keep friends. I was badly bullied at school and felt worthless and didn't have the confidence at that time to make friends, though I couldn't see it, but I really wanted to, I just didn't know how. At the time I was lonely and depressed. I joined the military just before I was your age and had buddies until I left and it was the military that sorted me out. With the benefit of age and lack of hormones I've come to accept that I have no friends for reasons. It doesn't bother me anymore. I've also realised I'm not a good friend, I make no effort, I'm not really interested in other people and find their problems annoying. I'm difficult and I don't really like people. And I like my own company. Do I worry about loneliness? No, but I often wonder if I didn't have my family would I get lonely... I don't know. All I know is that at the moment I'm not and I don't think I will be. But change is constant. All this is to say that you're young, it's likely not as bad as you think it is right now (I don't say this to lessen what you feel), and you will get passed this. Just be yourself, do what interests you and make the effort, even if it's not reciprocated. There's no shame in making unappreciated effort. Move on and don't over-think shit. Eventually it'll come. reply",

The energy one emanates is what attracts or pushes other people away. It is of course a very complex topic, how to reach a state of emotional well-being, but you can start by taking better care of yourself, your health and your mood will also improve. Once your general state of health/emotional well-being improves, you'll see that this state of craving others also fades. So how do you improve your well-being/health? The cornerstone should be paying attention to your body, your sensations, feelings and listening. Resting well when tired. Eating well. Noticing your thoughts, especially negative thoughts about yourself. Learn to be kinder to yourself. If you do these things, you'll feel better and you'll become a bit more attractive to others. reply",

A really unusual person is going to be way out on the fringes, without many nearby points, and finding those points - the people who get them - is going to take time. If you're one of those people then it's going to suck, especially in the beginning. But as time passes and you start to accumulate those rare relationships where things feel like they click, you'll probably be glad of it. The people you find will almost invariably be interesting weirdos, and enriching to be around in a way that people from the centre tend not to be. And on top of that, my experience has been that they appreciate the value of a good friend. Follow your interests and your values, be patient, and eventually you'll find into your people. reply",

          "text": "Join a club or professional fraternity (highly recommend). You'll make lifelong friends. You have to get out there and make it happen and don't bail if it seems daunting or makes you nervous. If you live on campus (you definitely should if possible), make friends with the people who live in your dorm. Keep your door open at all times and be friendly to everyone around. People will just drop in. If your uni has college basketball or football, become a fan of the team and go to the games or watch em in the dorm. In college you have tons of people around you with all sorts of different backgrounds. Rest assured, someone will have common interests with you and will find you fascinating. You don't need a lot of friends in this life, just a few good ones. Not everyone will like you, that's okay. I'd also recommend talking to a professional, you might need to practice your social interactions. They have groups for this sorta thing if they deem you ready, but there's something more going on that has put you in this situation I'd wager. Good luck! reply",

          "text": "This isn’t what you asked but I would remove all social media from your phone. Nothing makes you lonelier than social media. Facebook and instagram should be the first to go. TikTok as well. Delete them and watch if you start to feel better. As for the other. Most friends I’ve ever met went like this: meet at an event relating to a shared interest (first you have to go to things, next you have to talk to people): find a person I genuinely like and respect, talk to them, do something together (study, eat, coffee), listen more than you talk, try to be as good a friend to them as possible. And I’m easy. Anyone wants to be my friend and I’ll be theirs. (So long as they treat me as a friend —don’t get me started about people who claim to be friends but who don’t treat me like a friend). This leads me to having some really weird friends. This also leads me to having friends who always treat me right. I’m an introvert so I tend to prioritize small numbers of deep connections over many shallow friendships. Everyplace I go I find the person I like best and I try to get to know them. I talk to them, listen, hear what they’re about, engage with things they find interesting. At 19 you’ve never had a friend? I honestly don’t believe it. I suspect you’re experiencing a depressive episode that is clouding your memory. Every child has had a friend. In grade school or middle school. Call your mother and ask her (I’m serious). I honestly think you’re not remembering clearly. It happens, I don’t know how to fix it, but looking for it might’ve a start. (If you haven’t I’d start looking for something you’re doing that drives people away. But I honestly don’t think you could be doing something without knowing it) Join clubs for things you find interesting. Get a job doing things you find interesting. Do favors for people, ask favors of people. Look for friendships in unlikely places. I once became friends with a professor who I did computer work for. We just got along. He invited me over for dinner with him and his wife. I was on his Christmas list (he made mix cds for people, I still have two he made me) reply",

So let’s invert it: what prevents/kills friendships? - lying (for whatever reason)\n- talking too much about yourself\n- not asking people about their lives\n- being too private\n- being too judgmental\n- not empathizing - e.g. someone tells you about something hard they’re experiencing and you change the subject\n- not caring to help (also showing you don’t care about others that aren’t in your friend-zone)\n- not offering help\n- not being kind\n- not smiling (more like makes it hard for people to approach you) Most of us want/need friends. Most of us want/need to talk to others about our lives. Someone just moved to where you live. They need a friend. They will strike a conversation w anyone. Even people in your past probably wanted to be your friend (either coz they thought you were cool or they just needed a friend) - you can still be friends with them. I’ve become friends w people I met long after meeting them. Asking someone how they are is not so much about the other person. It’s mostly a social ritual. But if no one is asking you how you are, they might also be intimidated by you. As Aaron Burr would say: talk less, smile more - jk, do more of both. reply",

Maybe there's something you're doing or saying, or even the way you look, that you're not aware of and has caused people to keep their distance from you. Given how long you've claimed you've been like this, it's very likely behavioral; you're giving off some characteristic that is telling most people you meet that you're not worth spending time with. It might be something as simple as avoiding eye contact, or strange body language, or not knowing how to hold even a rudimentary, surface-level conversation. These are all skills that can be learned, especially when you're still young. I was in a similar situation when I was younger; grew up relatively isolated, barely had any friends, etc. I was socially deprived and abused as a child, and have a speech impediment that has made socializing difficult at times, but I learned how to listen and ask questions and get to know people, and I actually became quite the social butterfly for a good chunk of my 20s and 30s. Now that I'm older, I'm back to being more isolated for personal reasons, but my life is different now and I don't care as much about it, nor am I as reliant on social connections as I used to be. Frankly, I never felt I fit in anywhere, nor have I ever truly liked anyone beyond whatever immediate social gratification I needed filling in the moment. Friendships and connections have always been fleeting, overhyped, and overblown to me, especially when I look back at my life so far and struggle to think of anyone I still care about. Social connections are important when you're younger, but I've found the older you get, the less important they become, especially if you're smart about how you live your life. reply",

          "text": "This may not make you feel better, but I was lonely until maybe age 25. That was the year I graduated and started my first job and made my first two real friends. Before that I sat alone in the back of the lecture hall in University and hated on all the fun-having classmates. Age 25 was also when I met my first girlfriend that lasted less than a year. Age 34 was when I met my second girlfriend, who became my wife, and how we are separated. Long story short, I'm pretty content with my life now. You can say I'm a bit of a late bloomer. I thought I would be alone forever too, so much so that in college I aspired to be a Buddhist monk. What helped me was learning how to be less socially awkward through work interactions. When I was 32 I solo backpacked Europe which made me seem like a more interesting person. Also I'm a bit of a people pleaser and I was helpful to some key people in my life and they are now my good friends. Also I saved and invested a good chunk of my income which kind of helps overall with confidence. > People find me funny and when I do talk to people we have decent conversations (though small talk tends to bore me). However that doesn’t lead anywhere and doesn’t bring me any kind of comfort or fulfillment. I’ve attributed my lack of friends to something that places all the blame on me. Maybe I’m ugly, maybe I’m not funny enough, maybe I’m dumb. I've felt all those things at some point. You don't have to be attractive or funny or a genius. I've always walked around with these recurring fantasies of being some secretly impressive superhero that saved the day publicly or had all these amazing talents and everyone would realize my worth. I realize now that everyone is too into their own lives to care, and even if they seem to admire something about you, they see it from the perspective of how it benefits themselves. This is absolutely fine, and human. I guess what I'm saying is that you'll grow out of this phase. Right now I have all the friends I could ever want, ironically at a phase I'm my life I want to be more solitary. reply",

If you do have a well-studied issue such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder that interferes with socialization, you can find support groups and people who have been able to succeed even with those issues. Some of these social problems (e.g, ones caused by missing childhood socialization experiences) are curable through practice, but others will require you to learn enough about human social behavior to mask until someone figures out a cure. It can be exhausting, (just like physical exercise can be exhausting) but it's a useful skill to have in order to do well in life. Good luck. reply",

You can join tour groups and visit some cool places. Don't do this to specifically find friends but you will be part of a group and have companionship for a brief period. Thirdly - dating. You will be able to find a partner. This is most peoples main companion in life. Fourthly - you could join a non-work team where you can have social interactions.

It sounds like you might have some surface level relationships and want deeper connections with people, which is totally understandable. Small talk can be boring at first, but it often opens the possibility of deeper relationships. I'd recommend low-stakes/activity based social interactions and seeing where they take you. Some ideas: - If you're on your way to the dining hall to get a meal, ask your dorm mates if they wanna join - Colleges have a movie night on weekends to see a movie for free, ask class mates, dorm mates to go. - Does your campus have like a rec/game center (think pool, air hockey, games etc). Another thing to ask people to. You might have to suffer through a lot of rejection before you get takers. After that you might have to suffer through small talk about the weather, where someone is from, what their major is, etc before you get to the deeper connections. reply",

Punting it to 2026. I'm thinking to get the Samsung Galaxy XR and experiment with some VR apps and learn the fundamentals of spatial computing. As an Android mobile developer, that feels like a natural extension.<p>- Complete the \"UCSanDiegoX: Computer Graphics II: Rendering\" computer graphics course. I did the first course in the series and found it enlightening (no pun intended)<p>- Create an e2e project that earns money as a side gig. It's time to put my product and technical knowledge to practice and actually build something people want.<p>- Leverage AI across all my endeavors. AI tools are here to stay and the more I know how to use them effectively, the better. The speed boost in learning a new framework/concept is phenomenal.<p>Non-technical skills:<p>- Expand my social circle - the unstable tech climate made me realize the importance of maintaining a healthy social network. My goal is to connect with more people both inside my company and outside, by both proactively reaching out and going to meetups in my area. In fact, I invite fellow NYC-based HN-ers to contact me at cybercreampuff at yahoo dot com, in case you want to meet up!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "This is a new years resolution question barely in disguise, but they're fun cause a lot of us are cooped up, barely 4 days into winter, 86ish to go, and we're champing at the bit for change. I am pretty sure I'm a 50th percentiler. I'm mid 40s, kinda burned out but still struggling forward in my ok-but-not-hollywood IT career, I still have a passion for doing things well in a technical society that values doing things cheap (and well). The things I am known for being good at, I still google daily, and for a long time, I've been hungry for a change - any change - but especially one that isn't chaotically negative. So in 2026, I wanna learn how dirt works. I actually have a giant box of dirt sitting on a shelf at the UNH community co-op soil analysis lab, waiting to give me some kind of data about the soil behind my house. (Or is it dirt? I don't know what I'm getting into). In 2024 I tried growing some corn. It never sprouted. In 2025 I tried growing some corn. It sprouted and a few ears had enough kernels to make one full mouthful. Tasty, but maybe 7 calories of food for a year of effort. So in 2026 I'd like to grow: one entire fully formed ear of sweet corn. Anything else is a bonus. That's what I wanna develop in 2026 - learning how soil works enough to make it make a thing.  Small moves, Ellie. reply",

          "text": "Great hobby! A couple of things about corn. It might not be soil at issue. Germination depends on correct temperature and moisture. Too much moisture the seed will rot or not have enough air to germinate. Too little moisture it won't trigger germination. Too deep it won't germinate, too shallow and germination won't happen either because it will dry out instead of staying moist. Seeds vary in depth they require and some even require light to germinate (doesn't apply to corn). It's a bit of an art figuring out what \"even moisture until germination\" is, and this varies based on soil type. Timing of planting with correct temperature is important. Each kernel of corn has one silk. The silk is analogous to a Fallopian tube with pollen traveling down into the ovary (or kernel of corn in this case). If you have an ear of corn with only a few kernels it's often because pollen didn't land on all the silks. For this reason corn is usually planted in blocks. It's wind pollinated so wind shakes pollen off the tassels or male flowers at the top, down onto the silk. But if you just have one corn plant in isolation, or a row in isolation it's easier for the pollen to just blow away or miss. Planting in blocks or \"array of arrays\" configuration helps the pollen to reach the silk more uniformly as pollen from the surrounding plants is released. reply",

          "text": "That's kinda wild to hear about the corn because I've found corn to be one of the easiest crops to grow. If you want to try again, these are the seeds I last used which had 100% germination and produced plenty of ears of corn. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005MI33BS I've also had a ton of luck growing corn in 5 gallon buckets with holes drilled in the side to allow air into the soil which keeps the roots from balling up (wasting energy that should go into growing ears).  Used potting mix with a handful of lime and a handful of epsom salt, and topped the buckets with mulch to retain moisture. If you're willing to try that approach, this was very similar to my system: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptgJn15TmRM reply",

I have similar years experience and regularly try out AI for development but always find it’s slower for the things I want to build and/or that it produces less than satisfactory results. Not sure if it’s how I use the models (I’ve experimented with all the frontier ones), or the types of things I’m building, or the languages I’m using, or if I’m not spending enough, or if it’s just my standards are too high for the code that is produced but I usually always end up going back to doing things by hand. I try to keep the AI focused on small well defined tasks, use AGENT.MD and skills, build out a plan first, followed by tests for spec based development, keep context windows and chats a reasonable length etc, but if I add up all that time I could have done it myself and have better grasp of the program and the domain in the process. I keep reading how AI is a force multiplier but I’m yet to see it play out for myself. I see lots of posts talking about how much more productive AI has made people, but very few with actual specifics on setup, models, costs, workflows etc. I’m not an AI doomer and would love to realize the benefits people are claiming they get.... but how to get there is the question reply",

The algorithm (PID controller) itself was properly implemented (as there is plenty of data to train on), but it was trying to optimize the wrong thing. There were other similar findings where LLM was doing very stupid mistakes. So I went through a disillusionment stage and kind of gave up for a while. Since then, I have learned how to use Claude Code effectively. I have used it mostly on existing Django code bases. I think everybody has a slightly different take on how it works well. Probably the most reasonable advice is to just keep going and try different kind of things. Existing code bases seem easier, as well as working on a spec beforehand, requiring tests etc. basic SWE principles. reply",

This is where I’ve been at for a while now. Every couple of months I try again with latest models and latest techniques I hear people talking about but there’s very little concrete info there that works for me. Then I wonder if it’s just my spend? I don’t mind spending $30/month to experiment but I’m not going to drop $300/month unless I can see evidence that it’ll be worth it, which I haven’t really seen, but maybe there’s a dependency and you don’t get the result without increased spend?

          "text": "> This is step 3 of “draw the rest of the owl” :-) Fair enough :-) This reminds me about pigeon research by Skinner. Skinner placed hungry pigeons in a \"Skinner box\" and a mechanism delivered food pellets at fixed, non-contingent time intervals, regardless of the bird's behavior. The pigeons, seeking a pattern or control over the food delivery, began to associate whatever random action they were performing at the moment the food appeared with the reward. I think we humans have similar psychology, i.e. we tend to associate superstitions about patterns of what were doing when we got rewards, if they happen at random intervals. To me it seems we are at a phase where what works with LLMs *(the reward) are still quite random, but it is psychologically difficult for us to admit it. Therefore we try to invent various kinds of theories of why something appears to work, which are closer to superstitions than real repeatable processes. It seems difficult to really generalize repeatable processes of what really works, because it depends on too many things. This may be the reason why you are unsuccessful when using these descriptions. But while it seems less useful to try to work based on theories of what works -- although I had skeptical attitude -- I have found that LLMs can be huge productive boost -- but it really depends on the context. It seems you just need to keep trying various things, and eventually you may find out what works for you. There is no shortcut where you just read a blog post and then you can do it. Things I have tried succesfully:\n- modifying existing large-ish Django projects, adding new apps to it. It can sometimes use Django components&HTMX/AlpineJS properly, but sometimes starts doing something else. One app uses tenants, and LLM appears to constantly struggle with this.\n- creating new Django projects -- this was less successful than modifying existing projects, because LLM could not imitate practices\n- Apple Swift mobile and watch applications. This was surprisingly succesful. But these were not huge apps.\n- python GUI app was more or less succesful\n- GitHub Pages static web sites based on certain content I have not copied any CLAUDE.md or other files. Every time Claude Code does something I don't appreciate, I add a new line. Currently it is at 26 lines. I have made a few skills. They are mostly so that they can work independently in a loop, for example test something that does not work. Typically I try to limit the technologies to something I know really well. When something fails, I can often quickly figure out what is wrong. I started with the basic plan (I guess it is that $30/month). I only upgraded to $100 Max and later to $180 2xMax because I was hitting limits. But reason I was hitting limits was because I was working on multiple projects on multiple environments at the same time.  The only difference I have seen is that I have hit the limits. I have not seen any difference in quality. reply",

          "text": "Thanks for the info. I try a mix of things I know well and things I want to play around with. Swift and iOS was something that didn’t work so well for me.  I wanted to play around with face capture and spent a day with Claude putting together a small app that showed realtime video of a face and put dots on/around various facial features and printed log messages if the person changed the direction they were looking (up down left right) and played a sound when they opened their mouth. I’ve done app development before, but it’s been a few years so was a little bit rusty and it felt like Claude was really helping me out. Then I got to a point I was happy with and I thought I’d go deeper in the code to understand what it was doing and how it was working (not a delegation issue as per another comment, this was a play/learning exercise for me so wanted to understand how it all worked) - and right there in the apple developer documentation was a sample so that did basically the same thing as my app, only the code was far simpler and after reading through the accompanying docs I realized the Claude version had a threading issue waiting to happen that was explicitly warned against in the docs of the api calls it was using. If I’d gone to the developer docs in the beginning I would have had a better app, and better understanding in maybe a quarter of the time. Appreciate the info on spend.  The above session was on the $30/month version of Claude. I guess I need to just keep flapping my wings until I can draw the owl. reply",

Subjectively interacting with an LLM gives a sense of progress, but objectively downloading a sample project and tutorial gets me to the same point with higher quality materials much faster.

I am reading between the lines here, trying genuinely to be helpful, so forgive me if I am not on the right track. But based on what you write, it seems to me you might have not really gone through the disillusionment phase yet. You seem to be assuming the models \"understand\" more than they really are capable of understanding, which creates expectations and then disappointment. It seems to be you are still expecting CC to work at a level of a senior professional on various roles, instead of assuming it is a junior professional. I would have probably approached that iOS app by first investigting various options how the app could be implemented (especially as I don't have deep understanding of the tech), and then explore each option to understand myself what is the best one. The options in your example might be the Apple documentation page. It it might be some open source repo that contains something that could be used as a starting point etc. Then I would have asked Claude to create a plan to implement the best option. During either the option selection or planning, the threading issue would either come up or not. It might come up explicitly, in which case I could learn it from the plans. It might be implicit, just included in the generated code. Or it might not be included in the plans or in the code, even if it is explicitly stated in the documentation. If the suggested plan would be based on that documentation, then I would probably read it myself too, and might have seen the suggestion. When reviewing the plan, I can use my prior knowledge to ask whether that issue has been taken into account. If not, then Claude would modify the plan. Of course, if I did not know about the threading issue beforehand, and did not have the general experience about the tech to suspect such as a issue, nor read the documentation and see the recommendation, I could not find the issue myself either. If the issue is not found in planning or progamming, the issue would arise at later stage, hopefully while unit/system testing the application, or pilot use. I have not written complex iOS apps personally so I might have not caught it either -- I am not senior enough to guide it. I would ask it to plan again how to comprehenively test such an app, to learn how it should be done. What I meant by standard SWE practices is that there are various stages (requirements, specification, design, programming, testing, pilot use) where the solution is reviewed from multiple angles, so it becomes likely that this kind of issues are caught. The best practices also include iteration. Start with something small that works. For example, first an iOS application that compiles, and shows \"Hello, world\" etc. and can be installed on your phone. In my experience, CC cannot be expected to independently work as a senior professional on any role (architect, programmer, test manager, tester, pilot user, product manager, project manager). Junior might not take into account all instructions or guidance even if it is explicit. But it can act as a junior professional on any of these roles, so it can help senior professional to get the 10x productivity boost on any of these areas. By project manager role, I mean that I am explicitly taking the CC through the various SWE stages and making sure they have been done properly, and also that I iterate on the solution. On each one of the stages, I take the role of the respective senior professional. If I cannot do it yet, I try to learn how to do it. At the same time, I work as a product manager/owner as well, to make decisions about the product, based on my personal \"taste\" and requirements. reply",

I mean I'm definitely still in the stage of disillusionment, but I'm not treating LLMs as senior or expecting much from them. The example I gave played out much as you described above. I used an iterative process, with multiple self-contained smaller steps, each with a planning and discussion stage where I got the AI to identify ways to achieve what I was looking to do and weigh up tradeoffs that I then decided on, followed by a design clarification and finalisation stage, before finally getting it to write code (very hard sometimes to get the AI not to write code until the design has been finalised), followed by adjustments to that code as necessary. The steps involved were something like: - build the app skeleton - open a camera feed - display the feed full screen - flip the feed so it responded as a mirror would if you were looking at it - use the ios apis to get facial landmarks - display the landmarks as dots - detect looking in different directions and print a log message. - detect the user opening their mouth - play a sound when the mouth transitions from closed to open - etc Each step was relatively small and self-contained, with a planning stage first and me asking the AI probing/clarifying questions. The threading issue didn't come up at all in any of this. Once it came, the AI tied itself in knots trying to sort it out, coming up with very complex dispatching logic that still got things incorrect. It was a fun little project, but if I compare the output it just wasn't equivalent to what I could get if I'd just started with the Apple documentation (thought maybe it's different now, as per another commenter's reply). It's also easily completeable in a day if you want to give it a try :-)  Apple Developer reference implementation [here]( https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Vision/tracking-th... ). > By project manager role, I mean that I am explicitly taking the CC through the various SWE stages and making sure they have been done properly, and also that I iterate on the solution.

And this is partly what I mean when I say the time I spend instructing the \"junior\" LLM could be just as well spent implementing the code myself - because the \"project manager\" side of me can work with the \"senior dev\" side of me at the speed of thought and often in parallel, and solving the challenges and the design of something is often where most of the time is spent anyway. Skills are changing this equation somewhat due to the way they can encode repeatable knowledge, but not so much for me yet especially if I'm trying things out in radically different areas (I'm still in my experimental stage with them). > Could you really have done a complex mobile app alone in one day without knowing the stack well beforehand? No, but that's not what happened here. The mobile app wasn't complex (literally only does the things outlined above) and I've done enough mobile development and graphics/computer vision development before that the stack and concepts involved weren't completely unknown, just the specifics of the various iOS APIs and how to string them together - hence why I initially thought it would be a good use case for AI. It was also an incredible coincidence that the toy app I wanted to build had an apple developer tutorial that did almost the same thing as what I was looking to build, and so yes, I clearly would have been better off using the documentation as a starting point rather than the AI. That sort of coincidence won't always exist, but I've thinking lately about another toy iOS/apple watch application, and I checked, and once again there is a developer tutorial that closely matches what I'm looking to build.  If I ever get around to experimenting with that, the developer docs are going to be my first port of call rather than an AI. > I certainly could not have done one year ago what I can do today, with these tools. Right, and if you look back at my original reply (not to you), this is what I'm trying to understand - the what and how of AI productivity gains, because if I evaluate the output I get it's almost always either something I could have built faster and better, or if not faster then at least better and not so much slower that the AI was enabling a week of work to be done in a day, and month of work to be done in a week (claims from the GP, not you). I would love to be able to realize those gains - and I can see the potential but just not the results. reply",

Ok. I have done similar, too. For example, when starting a new Django project, I will rather copy an old project as basis than create a new from scratch with LLM. If there already exists full documentation or repo of exactly what you are trying to do and/or it is something you have already done many times, then LLM might not add too much value, and may even be a hindrance. reply",

          "text": "I’m perfectly comfortable and used to delegating, but delegation requires  trust that the result will be fit for purpose. It doesn’t have to be exactly how I would do it but at a minimum it has to work correctly and have acceptable performance for the task at hand. This doesn’t mean being super optimized just that it shouldn’t be doing stupid things like n+1 requests or database queries etc. See a sibling comment for one example on correctness, another one related to performance was querying some information from a couple of database tables (the first with 50,000 rows the next with 2.5 million) After specifying things in enough detail to let the AI go, it got correct results but performance was rather slow. A bit more back and forthing and it got up to processing 4,000 rows a second. It was so impressed with its new performance it started adding rocket ship emojis to the output summary. There were still some obvious (to me) performance issues so I pressed it to see if it could improve the performance.  It started suggesting some database config tweaks which provided some marginal improvements but was still missing some big wins elsewhere - namely it was avoiding “expensive” joins and doing that work in the app instead - resulting in n+1 db calls. So I suggested getting the DB to do the join and just processing the fully joined data on the app side. This doubled throughout (8,000 rows/second) and led to claims from the AI this was now enterprise ready code. There was still low hanging fruit though because it was calling the db and getting all results back before processing anything. After suggesting switching to streaming results (good point!) we got up to 10,000 rows/second. This was acceptable performance, but after a bit more wrangling we got things up to 11,000 rows/second and now it wasn’t worth spending much extra time squeezing out more performance. In the end the AI came to a good result, but, at each step of the way it was me hinting it in the correct direction and then the AI congratulating me on the incredible “world class performance” (actual quote but difficult to believe when you then double performance again). If it has just been me I would have finished it in half the time. If I’d delegated to a less senior employee and we’d gone back and forth a bit pairing to get it to this state it might have taken the same amount and effort but they would’ve at least learnt something. Not so with the AI however - it learns nothing and I have to make sure I re-explain things and concepts all over again the next time and in sufficient detail that it will do a reasonable job (not expecting perfection, just needs to be acceptable). And so my experience so far (much more than just these 2 examples) is that I can’t trust the AI to the point where I can delegate enough that I don’t spend more time supervising/correcting it than I would spend writing things myself. Edit: using AI to explain existing code is a useful thing it can do well.  My experience is it is much better at explaining code than producing it. reply",

When I’m writing my own code I can verify the logic as I go and coupled with a strong type system and a judicious use of _some_ tests its generally enough for my code to be correct. By comparison the AI needs more tests to keep it on the right path otherwise the final code is not fit for purpose. For example in a recent use case I needed to take a json blob containing an array of strings that contained numbers and needed to return an array of Decimals sorted in ascending order. This seemed a perfect use case - a short well defined task with clear success criteria so I spent a bunch of time writing the requirements and building out a test suite and then let the AI do its thing. The AI produced ok code, but it was sorted everything lexicographically before converting to a Decimal rather converting to Decimals first and sorting numerically so 1000 was less than 900. So I point it out and the AI says good point, you’re absolutely correct and we add a test for this and it goes again and gets the right result but that’s not a mistake I would have made or needed a test for (though you could argue it’s a good test to have). You could also argue that I should have specified the problem more clearly, but then we come back to the point that if I’m writing every specific detail in English first, it’s faster for me just to write it in code in the first place. reply",

If it fails, it’s not allowed to edit the source code, instead it must determine if there is a bug in the test or the source code. If the test is buggy it should try again, if there is a bug in the source code it should pause, propose a fix, and consult with you on next steps.

I am not going to just deny myself access to apps on schedule -- my brain never clicked schedule, not even once in my life -- but through a persistent and sustainable self-change from deep within. It's slow but it's beginning to work. - MANDATORY: Get more intimate with my Neovim. I've always kind of half-arsed my editors / IDEs, I always found it annoying to become a deep expert. This must change; surface-level skills rob you of productivity. I already am hugely annoyed by my typing speed, which is quite excellent but still not enough to work almost at the speed of thought. I want to achieve something near to these levels. - OPTIONAL: Integrate closer with one ore more LLM agents for coding. I have not paid for any yet but copying-pasting from a web UI gets tiring. Sometimes you really just want to say \"OK, now remove that duplicate test and include that edge case\" and see it materialize in 20 seconds. I am not against paying, it's just that so far the paid tiers have not been a blocker. Well, seems like they are now. - MANDATORY: Prioritize body. I have health conditions and I have a relatively good visibility how to fix them. I regularly end up desperately trying to solve more and more problems on the computer just so I don't get up and start a workout. I started turning this around but it's way too slow and time and age don't wait for anyone. In general: connect better with myself, forgive myself all the previous mistakes, understand why and how they came to be and remove the root causes, put myself on a better path.

          "text": "I would not even know how to call my so-called \"technique\" if somebody else did not do it for me: awareness. What I do I would today call \"reconciliation\" or \"making peace\". Let me explain. On the one hand, I start recognizing in a colder, more methodical and mathematical manner, what things I did screw up in my life and why. I drill down and understand what emotions, unmet needs and un-addressed trauma led to these faulty decisions. Then I say: I understand why I did it but this only worked against me, it's time to change it and put myself on a better path. And by \"better path for me\" I don't mean only financial and career success; I mean those _and_ being happier and calmer. On the other hand, I allow my more beastly / primitive / emotional / immature side to show up. I don't shun it, I try to sympathize with it and somewhat validate it. That's basically treating a part of yourself like an angry and lost kid: you do feel for them but want them to stop doing damage. But you also want to not force anything on them; you want them to understand and internalize they are only hurting themselves and others (in this case: other parts of you) with zero benefit for anyone involved. --- It's not easy. I had a very rocky start in life. Sure I did not sleep under bridges but growing up in a shitty Eastern European town with a gay brother and you yourself being the nerd who effortlessly gets all A grades and is also good at karate, physically attractive and liked by girls sadly had a ton of downsides that many people are blind of. Almost everyone hates you for being different and they feel threatened by you while all you want is to fit in and be a part of a friendly group. It was and still is a big tragedy, one I don't claim I have managed to come to terms with even as of today. --- But what I do lately is talk to my more primal side: \"Look, I really understand how much you hate doing X and Y. I hate them too! But what else would you do? We did it your way for so long, you had an almost complete full reign and look what happened -- now we all suffer from severely diminished physical and mental health, we hate our life and often our work, we know that we wasted our best years on pointlessly rebelling against things we could never change. Where did all that bring us? Please, work with me. I understand that you never feel heard because we never achieved the life you wanted. But I can't see any shortcuts. Do you? If not, then let us please take the long but much safer road to our goals. That way we'll still get there one day. If we are not making progress then we'll talk again and readjust strategy and maybe do things more your way. But in the meantime, can we do things my way for a while? Please?\" Or something very similar. But all that is 99% specific to me. You really have to find your own way to your deeper and more primal / emotional side. It exists and very often sabotages you because you never give it the wheel. Being civilized does this to us and no, I am not saying you should go outside and beat someone to death with a ratchet wrench of course. I mean that you should find a way to do the things you truly want, regardless of the cost. I am NOT doing this well at the moment. For example I am too chicken to give up programming. But as mentioned above, I am trying to reconcile a few factors the best way I can for the moment. Maybe if that unlocks more energy and more motivation then the time would be ripe for more drastic measures. One step at a time. reply",

Bootstrap your own operating system on a computer with literally nothing. Interesting to read about though as a tangent, very different kind of language.  \"grammar has no official specification\"  \"looks the word up in the dictionary\" and then does whatever the dictionary specifies. Good luck on the project though, seems like it fell out of use in the 80's and only got recovered recently.  The Forth Interest Group comments on the subject are funny too.

          "text": "The primary virtue of a Forth system is that it is interactive.  You can see this on any 1990s system that can start up in Open Firmware. I've started with a FIG-Forth kernel in 9900 assembler, which fits into 8K.  Many authors worked that code up to the 1990s branch I grabbed. To bring up the board, I cross-assemble to produce two Flash EEPROMs, plug them in, and power up.  The Forth kernel looks at block 6 for customizations where I tell it to compile some source packages I want from Flash.  One of these is -ASSEMBLER, which lets me create short chunks of native machine code to work on very low-level things like bit I/O, the SPI and I2C peripheral behavior.  Very good for debugging initial hardware. When I'm happy with some code, I add the source to the next EEPROM build. Block numbers were originally 1K chunks of disk, but can refer to any kind of storage like pages of ROM/RAM, or even to a process' virtual address space. reply",

          "text": "Similar experience w/ my daughter (now 12 y/o) here. We read the heck out of children's books when she was little. There were nights when I really didn't want to slog thru the same Suzy Spafford[6] book again, but I did it anyway. I think it paid off. My daughter is an avid reader now. She says she still wants me to read to her, so I do. This year was a bit sci-fi heavy, and we've decided to target more fantasy and literature in 2026. This year's books included: \"Below the Root\", \"And All Between\", and \"Until the Celebration\" - The \"Green Sky Trilogy\"[0] by Zilpha Keatly Snyder. We held off on playing the \"Below the Root\" video game[1] but I'm hoping that as we get into winter weather and outside time becomes more scarce we can get to it. It's arguably the final book in the \"trilogy\". \"Redshirts\"[2] by John Scalzi. We've been slowly making our way through Star Trek TOS in the last couple years so. That gave her enough cultural fluency with the tropes in the book to make it effective. \"To Say Nothing of the Dog\"[3] by Connie Willis. My daughter adores Victorian England and comedy. This book also turned her on to Jerome K. Jerome's \"Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog)\"[4] (which I'm still working thru on my own-- I do not particularly love Victorian England but it is a good book). Besides the books I read to my daughter, I also read Martha Wells' \"The Murderbot Diaries\"[5] series myself. I'm vaguely interested in the television adaptation. I'd love to hear what somebody who has read the series thinks of the TV version.

It felt like it was made for fans (the portrayal of the embedded show, Sanctuary Moon, was wonderful and I felt like whoever did their hairstyles had an immense amount of fun), yet accessible without knowing the story. Murderbot’s self-narration was good; I wanted more since it drove so much of the book but what was there in the show carried its personality well. Alexander Skarsgard pulled the character off well. My mental picture of Murderbot from the books was very different but now when I re-read the first book after watching the show, I heard his voice. I still feel slightly sad they didn’t get a more genderless or gender-ambivalent actor (he looks male, the bot was agender before the show) or tried to portray him differently… they could have reduced this but the way they filmed him assigns gender to an ungendered character. The other actors were all excellent too. I felt far more of a sense of them as a team and individuals than I remember from the first book. If you enjoyed the books I think you’ll enjoy the show, except for me that it has changed my picture of Murderbot and I am not sure for the better, in terms of what I felt were social / identity values the books encouraged. reply",

The narration seemed incredibly challenging (and kept making me think of \"A Christmas Story\", of all things). The integration of \"Sanctuary Moon\" sounds particularly fun. I definitely see Murderbot as genderless and seeing it as gendered is going to be weird. Fortunately, the series isn't particularly \"dear\" to me and I think I can deal with the trauma of having my mental pictures wiped-out by somebody else's.

          "text": "Technical followed by non-technical. I read more than these, but these are the highlights. Mouse, a Language for Microcomputers by Peter Grogono - Mouse is basically an esolang with barely any abstraction facilities, but the book was well-written and the language compelling enough to explore further. Notes on Distance Dialing (pdf) by AT&T - Described the telephone systems of the USA and Canada in the mid-1950s. The reading is a dry as it gets, but it was a fascinating dive into a vastly complex system solving extremely hard problems. This is a must-read for folks interested in systems-thinking. That said, I am actively looking for recommendations for books about the process of designing and building the unbelievably complex telephony system over the rudiments of the earlier systems. Recommendations welcomed! The Eye of Osiris by R. Austin Freeman - This is the first book that I’ve read from Freeman and I suspect that I will read many more in the future. The story follows the disappearance of John Bellingham, Egyptologist and the subsequent investigation. As the investigation stalls, the eminent Dr. Thorndyke digs into the case. The story sets up the mystery nicely and indeed provides enough information to the reader to infer how the disappearance occurred and who or what facilitated it. The book is one of the best whodunits that I’ve ever read. The Mystery of Edwin Drood by Charles Dickens - His final work remains unfinished as he passed away before he could complete it. Further complicating the meta-story is that he also didn’t outline the ending nor even put to paper the “villain” of the story. The meta-mystery of the ending has motivated a mountain of speculation around the ending including dozens of continuations of the story from other authors, all deriving their pet endings from textual hints, accounts from Dickens’ friends, illustration notes, and even in some cases seances supposedly accompanied by the spirit of Dickens himself. What was written by Dickens is spectacular and a compelling mystery and although it would be great to know the resolution, in some ways the “Droodiana” that has cropped up over the past 150+ years is reason enough for it to remain a mystery. The whole lore around Edwin Drood is a worthwhile hobby in itself and well-worth exploring. The Chiltern Library edition of the book contains the story and a good bit of the lore around the writing and the meta-works available at the time of its publication. The Shadow People by Margaret St. Clair - Sadly out of print and difficult to find, but I’ve had it on my shelves for decades and finally got around to reading it. The book came onto my radar in the 1980s when I learned about it in the appendix-n of the 1st edition Advanced D&D Dungeon Masters Guide. I enjoyed many of the books at the time and have slowly swung around to re-reading them over the past few years. Sadly, most on the list do not stand the test of time for me, but St. Clair’s mixture of 60s counter-cultural leanings in a fantasy/sf world still works. The cultural touch-points in the book feel quite dated, but despite the occasional awkwardness, the story is unique even today. Lolly Willowes by Sylvia Townsend Warner - The book started as a passable novel of manners focused on a turn of the century British middle-class family. The titular character was mostly background decoration for the first third of the novel and AFAIR was talked about only in the third-person. It’s only when she made the choice to move out on her own to the country in her middle age does she gain a central role in the narrative and her inner thoughts revealed. This is where things really pick up because I was shocked to learn that this unassuming woman’s inner thoughts had a delicious darkness to them. I don’t want to give away too much, but I’ll just say that you will not expect how the story ends. Patience by Daniel Clowes - A profound graphic novel using time-travel to explore the idea of enduring love with a story that proceed through time, following Jack as he tries to alter the past and save the woman he loves. This well-known science fiction motif is elevated by Clowes’ signature psychological complexity. Narcissus and Goldmund by Herman Hesse - I’ve read most of the books by Hermann Hesse but this one escaped my attention until this year. The story follows the parallel lives of a monk Narcissus and his passionate friend Goldmund as they respectively search for meaning in life through spiritual means and through pleasures of the flesh. We Who Are About To… by Joanna Russ - A small group of astronauts crash land on a hostile alien world and quickly realize that rescue is unlikely to come. Many SF stories have started this way and so the expectation is that this is a colonization story… but Russ thrives on subverting reader expectations. Fifty Forgotten Records by R.B. Russell - Another lovely entry in Russell’s series (one can hope) of autobiographical explorations of art, so far covering literature and now music. This book describes 50 records of varying popularity and Russell’s personal connections to each. While I certainly enjoyed finding a dozen or so new albums to explore, the true triumph of the book lies in the vulnerable, reflective memoir threaded throughout. The Way of All Flesh by Samuel Butler A novel that follows 4-generations of the Ponitifex family, with a particular bildungsroman-esque thread around Ernest, a young man who’s naivete leads to his downfall and how his life unfolds thereafter.

          "text": "Sci-fi nerd recommendations follow. I binged the entirety of the Dungeon Crawler Carl series. The cover, & the fact that it was on Kindle Unlimited, made me think it was probably cheap crap, but I was impressed with how well-written it was, and how much I empathized with the characters. (I probably should have read it slower; by the last two books, I was just flowing with the text, not paying as much attention to the overarching plot.) Heinlein's \"Orphans of the Sky\" was pretty bad. So much early scifi is considered great because it's groundbreaking, writing about things nobody else has before. The concept of a generation ship was pretty new at the time Heinlein was writing it, and it has some very interesting concepts, but the book has some really bad problems . If you've read it, you know; if you haven't, and decide to, you'll see it for yourself. I binged a few Brandon Sanderson books. The standalones are great; the Stormlight Archive is a huge slog through some beautiful writing, but I'm not sure I'm willing to spend so much time in beautiful books that move the plot forward so slowly. Exordia, by Seth Dickinson, started off incredible, kept going, but the ending felt like both a fizzle as well as a cliff-hanger for the next book. I'm glad I read it, but I wish it had a clear conclusion it wanted to reach. Adrian Tchaikovsky's \"Children of Memory\" delivers more of the great philosophical questions & answers about the nature of consciousness and personhood that the previous books did, A+. No idea where he could possibly go from there, but if he does, I'm going along for the journey. (Honorable mention: Alien Clay. Dishonorable mention: Service Model.) Eric Flint's \"Fenrir\" was a fun BDO near-future space adventure. (As was John Sanford's Saturn Run, but that wasn't a 2025 book I read.) reply",

You can now read lots of those stories on-line (like at https://www.freesfonline.net/Magazines2.html ).  Some of them have stood the test of time, but some are really really bad.  John Campbell, the editor of Analog back then, was racist, and also convinced that smoking tobacco was a Good Thing.  Many of the stories were written (by others) to convey those ideas; it's almost unusual for lead characters not to light up a cigarette. It will be interesting to see how much of today's scifi holds up half a century from now---not because the science is wrong, but because the moral qualities will be judged outlandish. reply",

If you're getting/have a newborn, this is the book I'd read. It's humane. No sleep training, no nonsense about babies. We went full ‘possum’ with our baby and I like how happy he became. I've also read Ten Things I Wish You Knew About Your Child's Mental Health. To me this could be an instant classic. No fluff, lots of advice for parents. Prima. There's plenty of literature on parenting, but so much of it is poorly written or poorly researched. Be careful out there. (And don't read PLS, yikes.) --- I finally discovered Andy Weir, the Thursday Next series, and The 13.5 Lives of Captain Bluebear. I'm amazed it took me so long to get there. All excellent. For some reason I decided to read all 7 Harry Potters in French. If you're learning French, it's a great idea, the French gets progressively harder so you can keep up! Bryson's At Home: A Short History of Private Life has been my companion for some weeks, but it's quite long. I'm happy with all my reading this year, some 32 books, many in a foreign language. Given I've no time to read during the day, and can only get some pages in after the kid's in bed, it's not too shabby. Oh, and we've read Stompysaurus, like, 90 times? Grawwwwr!

Here's some quotes to give you a feel: \"The smartphone is the electrical stunner in the slaughterhouse of society\" \"You’ll be able to access any TV or radio station in real time, around the world, talk to people overseas in high resolution video with live translations for free and be bored by it\" \"In the future the hermetic spaces of solitude will be breached as we build a global village. The private will become public and, ironically, the public will become private as the streets empty of experiences taken indoors, inside of bedrooms, beneath our screens of glowing grace.\" It's intentionally meant to be ambitious, brutal and challenging.

Here's my log for 2025, most recent at the top. Currently I am slogging my way through Heinlein's \"The Number of the Beast\" which I'm not a fan of. Halfway done with it though! Gabrielle Zevin, \"The Hole We're In\" (not my usual genre, enjoyed this though) Robert A. Heinlein, \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" (pretty good) Robert A. Heinlein, \"Time Enough for Love\" (PHENOMENAL, highly recommended) Robert A. Heinlein, \"Methuselah's Children\" (pretty good, required to understand \"Time Enough for Love\") Richard K. Morgan, \"Altered Carbon\" (very good) Robert A. Heinlein, \"The Rolling Stones\" (young adult, but good all the same) Robert A. Heinlein, \"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\" (very good) Piers Anthony, \"On A Pale Horse\" (very good, never got very far into the series though) Lincoln Child, \"Full Wolf Moon\" (okay, not great) Lincoln Child, \"The Forgotten Room\" (pretty good) Lincoln Child, \"The Third Gate\" (very good) Lincoln Child, \"Terminal Freeze\" (okay, not great) William Gibson, \"In the Beginning… Was the Command Line\" (good, but outdated, look up what he's said about it more recently) Lincoln Child, \"Deep Storm\" (very good) James Patterson, \"Along Came a Spider\" (not my usual genre, okay though) Jules Verne, \"Around the World in 80 Days\" (from childhood, revisited) reply",

Kindle app syncs between devices, and makes it easier to read a few pages here and there instead of waiting for uninterrupted sessions with my Kindle. 3. Continually updating a To Read list, mostly by going to Barnes and Noble, taking pictures of featured book tables, then adding the interesting ones to my Libby hold list. 4. Borrowing with Libby makes it easier to bail out of a book that doesn't intrigue me.

          "text": "My top book of the year: Fryderyk Chopin: A Life and Times , Alan Walker A riveting read by a legendary musicologist and biographer.  Walker spent about ten years researching this.  It is 700 pages, which seems daunting but he makes this authoritative bio absolutely enjoyable.  It's also a \"corrective biography\", it dispels a lot of myths.  This book is one of the best examples of accessible writing with flair.  What a writer! Throughout the book, Walker tastefully quotes musical phrases (in notation) from Chopin's works to situate them in context.  I often paused reading and put on the track on a given page (nocturnes, mazurkas, preludes, etc).  It made the reading experience incredibly rich and fun.  Other things I enjoyed: Chopin's letters to his friends and family, life in aristocratic salons of Paris, London, Warsaw, and more—Chopin had unparalleled access.  Of course, there's also a lot of gut-wrenching stuff.  As the book's blurb says, it really is for both the casual music lover and the professional pianist. If you haven't discovered them yet, give a listen to Chopin's nocturnes.  But please, give them an attentive listen and play them on a high-quality audio system.  Here[1] is one of his finest nocturnes (it is less famous than the \"happier\" nocturne that follows it, Op. 9 No. 2).

But please -- you don't need to \"blast\" this music. This is not rock :-) Yes, there are a lot of \"dynamics\" (soft and loud and some gradations: pianissimo , forte , etc), but don't overthink it.

There were a lot of similar other failure points I used to keep enumerated mentally, but now there's too many to count. The biggest ones are email access however.<p>Is there a process or method I can use to enumerate/track and fix those kids of failure points in my personal cybersecurity?</p></p></div>",

The emails are managed by the parents, sometimes as a child account (Gmail)\n4. Use a VCC service to generate a VCC for each child with a spending limit/require approval for all transactions. Keep it in the password manager so they can easily use it anywhere Once the emails are managed, setting up parental controls on the devices themself should be easy. On another note, keep the barrier low. Let them figure out a way to get past it. This is what they actually want to learn about, and by doing this it kinda \"forces\" them. This is how most kids that I've taught got into tech. reply",

Not quite an oxymoron but certainly a puzzlement. Maybe, generously, in retrospect, an aspiration? I never considered myself an actual engineer; I was (and still am) a self-taught un-credentialed computer programmer. More art than science. They made me take the title and the stock options and the business cards. I mostly worked for and with EEs, making software tools for test automation. I was a fanboy hardware wannabee (and still am), got some on me but was never a true engineer. I learned from those who practiced their discipline; it was plain to me the reality of real engineering versus what I was doing. I suppose in my travels I have on occasion encountered a true Software Engineer. I suppose there's reason to hope that software development will continue to mature and evolve, and eventually the other engineering disciplines will accept software as a science. For me, it will always be a joy to make that hardware work with my twiddly bits. Not engineering, no. But very rewarding work that often resembles engineering. reply",

Not AI related, but I got tired of janky desktop streaming / remote management solutions (I use the windows app on my Mac and Raspberry Pi Connect online) so I decided to build my own. You install a client on the system you want to manage and enroll it with a single command, just like Tailscale. I’ve built a nice web application were users can manage and access their devices, setup monitoring and configure alerts (for now it only tracks basic stuff like CPU/RAM…) The whole thing uses WebRTC for p2p connections and it’s very snappy because all the graphics pipeline is fully custom (all the enconding/decoding is platform-specific too) and I’ve managed to get latency and quality on par with Parsec in many scenarios (I still have some work to do here because it’s not my thing) I plan on making the whole thing open source with a permissive license and also offer a paid SaaS early in 2026 (I think early February?). I plan on offering a hobby free tier and then paid business/pro features but time will tell! I haven’t event built a landing page yet but if you are interested write me to ramon@rigel.sh reply",

Once that happens, it’s hard to tell what’s being used, by whom, and why costs are climbing. So we are building Fenra. Fenra is a simple tool for tracking AI costs, usage, and events across providers, surfacing patterns the way software teams actually want to see them. One place to understand what’s happening before the bill surprises you. We started about 15 days ago and already have our first pilot customer, with three other companies interested. If this sounds useful, bump your email in the comments to join the waitlist. reply",

          "text": "Funny you should mention this, I just added a simple filesystem sandbox to my coding agent. Check it out: https://github.com/jacobsparts/agentlib/blob/main/src/agentl... The framework is all python, but I used C for this helper.  It uses unprivileged user namespaces to mount an overlay and run an arbitrary command, then when the command finishes, it writes a tarball of edits, which I use to create a unified diff.  The framework orchestrates it all transparently, but the helper itself could be used standalone.  Here's a short document about the sandbox in the context of it's use in my project: https://github.com/jacobsparts/agentlib/blob/main/docs/sandb... I also have a version that uses SUID instead of unprivileged user namespaces, available by request. I often use claude code with --dangerously-skip-permissions but every once in a while it bites me.  I've learned to use git for everything and put instructions to always commit BEFORE writes in CLAUDE.md.  Claude can go off the rails on harder bug fixes, especially if there are multiple rounds of context compacting, it can really screw things up.  It usually honors guidance not to modify outside of the project, but a simple sandbox adds so much, after the session is over you can see what changed and decide what to do with it.  It really helps with the problem where it makes unexpected changes to the codebase, which you might not even notice otherwise, which can introduce serious bugs.  The permission models of all the coding agents are rough--either you can't get anything done, or you throw caution to the wind.  Full sandboxes are quite restrictive, which is why I rolled by own.  Honestly your best option right now is just to have good version control and run coding agents in dedicated environments. reply",

It is a long-term rolodex to be able to talk to former co-workers, while also getting contacted by recruiters (double-edged sword that that is), and for that purpose works just fine, even allowing you to ignore the other warts. So if you were going to build a competitor, you'd need to get everyone who has built a profile on linkedin and built a 20 year rolodex of their network to all migrate away. I'm not saying it cannot happen, I'm saying it is not a tech problem, so building a new flavor of the same app and hoping it wins out is an even higher-risk bet than most startups, and therefore does not fall into most people's risk tolerances. reply",

I feel like a broken record explaining this to people. The feed that appears when you go to LinkedIn.com is a sideshow. Almost nobody posts to it. Very few people read it. You can (and should!) ignore it and not miss out on anything. Make a profile. Update it occasionally when you're job searching. Forget about the site until you need it. Hit the unsubscribe button when they e-mail you suggestions. The exception is people who simply cannot resist getting pulled into a feed and scrolling it. If that's you, I understand why you'd stay off of the website. For everyone else, it's a set it and forget it until you need it kind of website. That's also why a second website isn't appealing to anyone. They've already gotten past the set-and-forget part. Why would they want to set up a second profile somewhere in a smaller, less useful network? There would have to be some real benefit, not an imagined talking point that disappoints. reply",

You can auto-cross-post to those big platforms to keep your reach (Buffer for personal sites), but your site stays the single source of truth. Once enough people join, we can launch our own open feed that connects directly to the people you follow. No need for the big platforms at all. You pull updates straight from their sites in real time and move freely without losing your content or your audience. It reuses the network effects we already have while giving you true ownership and independence. This also helps people who want to escape feeds entirely: with a personal site, they can subscribe to a simple newsletter, delivered daily, weekly, or monthly with all the updates, so they stay connected without the endless scroll of social media. reply",

The problem is that it's heavily biased toward people who spend a lot of time on LinkedIn scrolling the feed, which in my experience isn't the most positive signal for people you want to hire to focus on your work.

          "text": "To emphasize the dynamics: (1) No person will migrate until most of their connectors migrate, and their connectors cannot migrate until everyone does.  It's deadlock, for every thread you care about.  (2) Automation in job applications and a declining job market have both made networking more essential, so there's no tolerance for lost connections, so you'd also have to solve those problems too before all would switch.  (3)  Even if users don't like it and could surmount the coordination costs of switching, if companies continue to rely on it, switching would be a career-limiting move; and because companies cannot signal their recruitment strategies without triggering a stampede to game their system, companies tend to keep quiet, so no company would lead an exodus. Still, no one (outside influencers) likes how work networking and recruitment happens today, so user might do both linkedin and some new system if one created a more effective networking and recruitment mode (e.g., for some well-defined, high-value subset, like recent Stanford MBA's, YC alumni, FinTech, ...). reply",

And actually, even Instagram could be seen as a contender to it. YT, hackernews profiles, Twitter profiles even, are used as professional front platforms by many. There is no need for a contender because Linkedin is a poorly thought solution to an ill addressed problem. Moreover, it is undesirable to spend any more time than needed polishing a persona that is mostly relevant for a transitional life periods. Other social networks have become more addictive to use, and Linkdin is now incorporating such features to amalgamate the broadening depths of human time wasting. reply",

          "text": "Why is there strong competition for every other social media site? This seems to come down to a few market dynamics:\n1. The major influencers who adopt it and bring their followers\n2. New networks bring new leaderboards which attract the next generation that has zero equity on the existing sites\n3. Regular engagement is critical, otherwise every network faces a death spiral\n4. Engagement required to drive ad revenue LinkedIn is notable for not being affected by these:\n1. There are no major influencers (though they tried.) The most influential person on LinkedIn is very close in value to the median software engineer\n2. There are no significant leaderboards (though they tried.) Few people care how many followers others have\n3. Regular engagement doesn't matter, because it is still the Schelling point for irregular life events (ie needing a job.) \n4. Most of their revenue comes from subscriptions for recruiters, so the lower engagement is not an existential crisis. LinkedIn is an always-on jobs expo pretending to be social media. Even the executives think they are social media. They are actually something else. Some angles to compete:\n1. Build better data for an underserved segment. Obvious choice is SWE, but MSFT owns Github as a firewall here. Another candidate is the top 1% of executives: they might be the major influencers that haven't been activated yet.\n2. Build an identity layer that mitigates risk of fake job seekers. LinkedIn has halfheartedly tried this but their inertia might be an opportunity.\n3. Build the Github for other segments: the verifiable portfolios that show real work. \n4. Build a frontrunner to the hiring pipeline. If every star candidate can be identified three months before they start looking on LinkedIn, the recruiting system there will fall apart. \n5. Build the workplace social media network that users actually want to use daily. LinkedIn failed at this, and their effort indicates they see the risk of disruption coming from here. Some existing companies that are on the right track:\n1. Slack. Already owns DAU for work, well-funded, competes with MSFT in many domains. 30% confident they've considered moving into this space, but Benioff getting AI-pilled will slow it down.\n2. Behance. Owned the market for designers, sold to Adobe, game over.\n2. Glassdoor. Useful data that LinkedIn doesn't own, but they seem to have embraced the Yelp business model instead.\n3. Fishbowl. Daily engagement solved but they've backed into a local maxima.\n4. Upwork. Stuck with low-end brand that will prevent them from winning this market.\n5. X. Has all the pieces except for a leader who cares about a jobs board. Would need a certain kind of leader for their jobs product to get it to win.\n6. Every other talent startup: fighting for the right revenue, but they almost always approach it from the transactional staffing model or the ATS subscription model. Would need someone to buy all of them up and launch a network with 100M profiles on day one. reply",

Lighting/\"studio\" design is still an art, but you can get something set up in a day or two. The harder part is coming up with good video ideas, and doing a compelling title/thumbnail/hook. That's a rabbit hole. If you have a social media following you can leverage that. Cold calls can work if you're selling big ticket items, but you also need to be good at sales and do a lot of legwork so I wouldn't go down that route.

Since you like to, you know, eat occasionally, you start thinking about monetizing your code. Unfortunately, as you are learning, this is 100% backwards. Writing something that is commercially successful starts by identifying a potentially commercial product. In other words, you need to start by Marketing, not programming. You're looking for 3 things; A market you can reach;\nThat have money to spend;\nThat are prepared to spend money to make some pain go away. It might be obvious that a market might exist (say something that makes govt more effective) but selling to govt requires enormous resources you don't have. It might be obvious a market exists (a tool for refugees to apply for aid) but they have no money to buy anything from you. It might be obvious a market exists (trips to the moon) but you can't build that. Once you have found a market you can reach, who have some money, and are willing to spend (perhaps with a deposit) then (and only then) should you start coding. Commercializing stuff you have already made is hard because the product was tailored to a specific user, and he already has it (aka you). reply",

What I’ve been trying recently is to treat “visibility” as a side effect of building, not a separate activity. A few things that seem at least directionally helpful for me: • Sharing my work-in-progress on social platforms — not launches, but the actual process: what I’m building, problems I hit, and how I solved them. This feels more like documenting than promoting. • Writing about concrete technical or product decisions I made, especially when I had to compare different approaches or tools. Those posts sometimes get picked up organically because they’re useful on their own. • Analyzing competitors carefully, then selectively submitting my product to directories or communities where similar tools already exist. I avoid mass submission and try to match the audience instead. None of this has “worked” in a big way yet, but it feels sustainable and doesn’t get me blocked or downvoted. For me, that’s already a win. reply",

POS first because everyone has to record money. The value proposition is theft prevention, bookkeeping & taxes, etc. Inventory next because supply chains are too complex for most generic systems. Then some kind of customer retention/acquisition thing so they don't feel like it's a cost center. The market is too red ocean for VCs to enter. Sales doesn't scale exponentially. That's your moat. I would say just tackle one American sized state, not even the big ones. Users won't come to you. They'd go to whatever well known system is in your area. You have to go to them.

          "text": "\"Would you integrate with existing POS systems or is this a new one?\" Depends. The goal is to streamline workflow. A lot of the friction happens when recording transactions. How do you reduce that? 3 years ago, integrating with existing systems might be the smart move, but now with AI, you can build and maintain a POS from scratch faster than an integration. \"If a new one do you integrate with some existing hardware for card scans?\" Yeah, sell it with the hardware, keep friction down. They cost as much as a phone. Again, depends on the norm. I find in developing countries, it's typical to have the whole thing as one Android app on a card accepting device. There's cool stuff you can do with the receipt printers. If someone orders a latte with an extra shot and a croissant, you can print out a receipt and little paper things to give to the barista and the croissant guy. \"Do you have to sell the customer on migrating away from their existing system?\" Often yes. Most can export data, and you can write scripts to import them. You customize your product to their workflow. Like some people operate with wet hands.  Salons like to track how much shampoo is used to flag theft. Education systems may track credit and attach videos of classes. \"Price?\" Highly variable per state, sector, etc, but OP's requirement of $49/month should be fair. reply",

If I already pay $20/month for any LLM that's multi modal I can do this now already. The asset (animated doodles) doesn't really connect me to how I'm going to get a better click through rate.

          "text": "I never switched away from listening to my own music collection, so my experience may not be useful to you. Here's the setup I have. I run Kodi as my music server at home, with a NAS that contains all of my music. My collection is quite large and continues to grow. I get most of my new music on CDs (usually purchased at the merch table at live performances) or through Bandcamp these days, although I'm open to any source that allows me to have unencumbered lossless recordings. This allows me to use Kodi's native front end when I'm listening on my home sound system, to use a web front end to play on any web-connected computer, and to stream from my server to my smartphone when I'm out and about. It's the best of all worlds. I have all the convenience of a streaming service, but I actually own the music and it will never become suddenly unavailable or replaced by inferior versions, and I don't have a fixed recurring cost just to enjoy music. Plus, a ton of great music is simply not available on any commercial streaming platform and this eliminates that issue. I don't tend to use MP3s, though. I go with FLAC instead. Kodi will transcode the FLACs to other formats if needed. reply",

Personally, my music taste (and the amount of tracks that I listen to) is way more varied now than it was before, but I suppose that depends both on how you use streaming services and how you use local MP3s. Back when I still used exclusively MP3s, I used Music on Console Player [0] on my personal computer and Snae Player [1] on my school's chromebook, since we were only allowed to use web apps on our Chromebooks. On my phone I found VLC [2] to be the best app since it has so many features. I can highly recommend both programs. I still have all three installed and use them whenever I don't have internet. Although I haven't updated my local music library in a while, so I am reminded of my old music tastes whenever I open either of them.

          "text": "Muslim majority country here (Malaysia). Christmas day is a public holiday, and so is New Year's. It's also the end of the year when most people want to use up their paid time off. Nobody likes having a holiday on two Thursdays followed by work on Friday. Nor do we want to encourage people to carry vacation days to the next year. So we're happy to take the bulk time off at least, and it gives time for people to arrange school paperwork. It is technically a sin in Islam to celebrate other religious holidays. Heck, if you want to go deep into the dogma, everything besides the two Eids shouldn't be celebrated and that includes Prophet Muhammad's birthday and New Year's. But you'll see very heated debates about this that I won't go into. Christmas lies in a weird place on this spectrum. Some say Abrahamic holidays are fine, some say most 'Islamic' holidays are blasphemy. People argue about the Santa hats too. However, Christmas food is perfectly halal. Turkey, peppermint, non-alcoholic egg nog, various desserts. You'll see \"end of year\" dinners by Muslim restaurants that cater to this. Culturally, many of us do have Christian family and friends. So it is a convenient time to meet family and just have an excuse to cook complex Western dishes once a year. Gift giving is rare. You'll see secret Santa stuff at the workplace and in schools. 90% of people in the region do not have disposable income, so expensive gifts are frowned on, as they create pressure. Most are under $25, like fancy soap, snacks, chocolate, a power bank. There's also a culture where charity should be hidden, so stuff usually gets put in a box with no names and the boxes are pseudorandomly distributed. reply",

          "text": "I was a little steamed when my son came home from school with a pamphlet about winter festivals which listed all of them except for the astronomically correct one that us pagans celebrate. On the other hand, the Christian (apocryphal) idea that hope came into the world on the (almost) darkest day of the year is beautiful to me.  As well as the idea that some ancient Hebrews miraculously survived in a cave. I also like the idea that the celebrations start with advent like they do in Germany or that there are “12 days of Christmas” ending with the epiphany,  which is a real astronomical event which is part of the explanation of why Christians celebrate the day that they do.

Otherwise it doesn’t look fair or logical, isn’t it?

He was influential, but the world is bigger and history deeper than Christians want to believe. Hell, the only reason anyone even still cares about Jesus is because the Roman emperor Constantine decided Christians were more valuable to him fighting in his army than being fed to lions. If not for him, Christianity would have just been another weird Levantine cult and would have probably died out. So why not celebrate Constantine's birthday instead? Or the Apostle Paul's birthday? It was his idea to spread the faith to gentiles after all, and one could argue modern Christianity is more influenced by Paul than Jesus. This is not an opportunity for you to proselytize me. reply",

Paul and others were important for the religion yes, but without jesus and powerful message, influence there would have been nothing to work with. There a tons of examples in history of very popular jesus-like figures with even larger initial traction that nobody even knows today. So accidentally or not - he is the winner.

          "text": "Christma$$ is so very commercial. Jesus’ message is universally ignored, based on actions, and in fact the entire world economy is based on the seven deadly sins. [0] You wouldn’t want people to destroy the world economy by being devout, would you? Pride, Greed, Envy, Lust, Anger, Gluttony, Laziness. \nFrom the cited article: > Pride. Pride is the will to omnipotence. It’s the greatest of sins, and yet it’s everywhere: big business and the elites impose their rules on the world, new technologies are increasingly transgressive (AI, transhumanism, space conquest, etc.), skyscrapers are being built ever taller, etc. In one way or another, the biggest companies reflect this pride. > Greed. Greed is the excessive attachment to money, and the contemporary economy is based on the constant quest for profit. The accumulation of wealth, tax havens and excessive speculation are all modern forms of greed. > Envy. Envy is a deep-seated vice: it means wanting what someone else has. These days, marketing and advertising constantly make us dream of other people’s lives, in a competition where everyone tries to compare themselves, without ever being satisfied with what they are and what they have. In particular, social networking platforms … > Anger.  But the modern economy, by creating the best and the worst, generates inhuman inequalities that arouse anger in everyone. > Lust. Lust is the immoderate pursuit of sexual desire. The MindGeek company, which brings together the major platforms of the pornographic industry, including YouPorn, Pornhub, etc., is enjoying worldwide success. > Gluttony. Gluttony, as we all know, is not a passing fancy. It’s a compulsive need for food pleasure. As the modern economy constantly pushes us to consume, it also pushes those who can afford it to eat non-stop… > Laziness. Finally, laziness is not just weariness. It is the refusal of physical, moral and intellectual effort. There you go. We are creating tools that even think for us. So, only a few among us actually believe in the child’s message, and behave accordingly, (actions count, really they do) or at least try to. :-) [0] https://julienchevalier.com/en/the-economy-of-the-7-deadly-s... reply",

You can browse and ride at https://app.skidmarks.club . I’ve done ~10 rides with it so far. Hoping I can convince my wife to use it and save myself $50 a month. That would be my most successful side project by a wide margin. There are probably a lot of examples like this. Vibe coded software people made for themselves, and other people could use it if they wanted. All of the code was reviewed by myself, and I’m a programmer, so not sure if that fits the description. I didn’t go through it with a fine-toothed comb, however, and 90% of the review was on my phone. I also did some non-vibed setup for hosting, db, email, etcetera. To me vibe coding is not looking at any of the code at all, but the definition reads a little loose to me these days, especially on HN, as: did an LLM “type” most of the code or did you? Either way I don’t think the term or definition is a big deal and probably not worth splitting hairs over. reply",

It’s complex software (state, auth, heavy logic), but it will never be on Product Hunt because it's purely for internal utility.\nThe success metric here isn't \"did we get 10k users,\" it's \"did we avoid a $50k contract and weeks of integration hell.\" reply",

A few blind alleys lead in the wrong direction, but was always easy enough to back up and try a different approach. Database migrations and anything related to calculations have had a fair bit of hand holding. Beyond tests it writes I do still test by hand for confidence. It’s coming up to a year of use.

I have a tiny tissue culturing lab in my home and wanted to manage media batches and their ingredients, cultures using the batches of media, inventory for media ingredients, and general inventory for running things. Cleaning, cutting, measuring, etc. I couldn't find anything which would allow me to keep stock of what I've got in the structure I needed, let alone while also project things like \"I've got enough inventory for n batches of y media\". And all of the half-measure inventory software was expensive as hell. I also built a solution for myself that was largely vibe coded. The underlying schema for inventories, batches, orders, cultures, etc was done in advance to help guide Claude along with documentation, but I'd guess 75 percent of the code is pure Claude. It has worked really well for a while now. Since it's just me using it and I'm able to roll with issues it causes or verify outputs on the fly if I want to, it's totally fine not being super polished. It meaningfully increases my productivity by allowing me to manage things in a way that fits my mental model and business. Like you, the cost of the project has been less than a subscription. And the subscriptions wouldn't even do what I needed. reply",

          "text": "That's right, it's very doable. The technique for creating clean plants from infected plants is really cool and remarkably simple. You typically take tissue from the part of the plant called the meristem, where cells are actively dividing and less likely to be infected, then rapidly disinfect and transfer the tissue to a sterile culture. It seems like it should be such a sophisticated and complex process, but all you're doing is cutting a chunk of fresh cells out and popping it into some goo where it can continue to grow. Extracting meristem tissue is usually the only difficult part. They can be extremely tiny. It takes a sharp eye and very steady hands. I've only done it for practice, never out of necessity. I'm pretty bad at it. It seems kind of like magic if you ignore the biologal machinery. It makes perfect sense why it works, yet it's also absolutely crazy that it does. reply",

The \"Methodology\" that made it work:\nWe moved from initial idea to production in four weekends while I maintained a full-time role. The key was moving past \"chaotic vibes\" and treating different LLMs like specialized team members:  \nA) Strategic Layer (Gemini Pro): Used for architectural decisions (React/Vite, Node/Express, PostgreSQL/Prisma) and product prioritization. B) Execution Layer (Claude Code): Used for heavy lifting—implementing the cron jobs, refactoring API patterns, and writing the test suite. C) TDD as the Guardrail: We never \"just coded.\" Every AI-generated feature followed a strict Test-Driven Development cycle using Vitest. If the tests didn't pass, the code didn't go to production. The result is a stable system serving 200+ active users with a codebase that doesn't feel \"schizophrenic\" because we maintained strict cognitive boundaries and context documents for the AI to follow. reply",

I have found that the initial specs only go so far; as I use, \"what's missing\" becomes clearer. Workflow is build -> checkin to git -> build container -> deploy to Cloud Run.  I have a number of instructions for Claude for logs, frontend, backend, logging etc. based on my past experience.

While this is more pleasent in real-life tactile space, not as much fun when using the computer to have to click-and-drag all the pieces around (of course, sorting them etc, is up to the user, but just some kind of initial \"see all the pieces in the space without them overlapping each other to the greatest extent possible depending on the total space avaliable given the current zoom settings\" ... reply",

It's been a hell of a journey but a fun one, I'll list them below, but the most fun was actually adding an \"explore\" feature to my site to make it a bit more fun and interactive over the christmas break - https://blazingbanana.com/ - I might keep it, might not but was cool to see what can be done in browser with WebGL. https://blazingbanana.com/work/whistle - Whistle, which is a complete free, offline voice transcription app using whisper, available on all platforms, Linux, Mac, Windows (with CUDA builds), Android (and iOS as soon as my dev account goes through, who knew paying Apple £79 would be so hard!). To be honest the packaging part was probably the toughest bit and all the different ways each platform needs to build. - Probably my most \"successful\" one, at 450+ downloads on the Play store. https://formait.app/ - Free offline document formatting using LLMs to take a load of unstructured notes and give you a nice PDF output. You can load any GGUF model you throw at it as it's implementing llama.cpp, but uses Phi-4 out the box. It's actually quite a useful combination with Whistle, so thinking of integrating voice to text in at some point. This is available on all platforms (except mobile) with CUDA builds available too. reply",

          "text": "Not sure this counts as \"successful\" yet (invite-only beta, still rough), but I'm building a full product almost entirely via LLM-assisted coding. Tangents ( https://tangents.chat ) is an Angular/Nest/Postgres app for thinking-with-LLMs without losing the thread. - Branch: select any span (user or assistant) and branch it into a tangent thread so the main thread stays coherent. - Collector: collect spans across messages/threads into curated context, then prompt with it. - You can inspect a \"what the model will see\" preview and keep a stored context-assembly manifest. Vibe-coding aspect: about 600 commits and about 120k LOC (tests included) and I have not handwritten the implementation code. I do write specs/docs/checklists and I run tests/CI like normal. What made it workable for something larger than a static page: - Treat the model like a junior dev: explicit requirements plus acceptance criteria, thin slices, one change at a time. - Keep \"project truth\" in versioned docs (design system plus interface spec) so the model does not drift. - Enforce guardrails: types, lint, tests, and a strict definition of \"done.\" - The bottleneck is not generating code, it is preventing context/spec drift and keeping invariants stable across hundreds of changes. If you define \"vibe coding\" as \"I never look at the code,\" I do not think serious production apps fit that. But if you define it as \"the LLM writes the code and you steer via specs/tests,\" it is possible to build something non-trivial.

          "text": "You could probably find a good answer anywhere, but the solution is in a more nuanced view. Some types of programming benefit more from AI tooling than others.  For example, prototyping seems to be the most fruitful area.  Also, writing small utilities is much easier, to the extent that a two hour job would now take only a few minutes.  That's where you get the multiplier posts from. But working in a large codebase using proprietary libraries is not a solved problem for AI (yet). It's just that the average engineer does not spend all of their time on things that can be sped up. Speeding up 1% of your time by a factor 20 simply does not help very much.  But for some roles, I'm sure that a 10% net increase in productivity is realistic. reply",

Punting it to 2026. I'm thinking to get the Samsung Galaxy XR and experiment with some VR apps and learn the fundamentals of spatial computing. As an Android mobile developer, that feels like a natural extension.<p>- Complete the \"UCSanDiegoX: Computer Graphics II: Rendering\" computer graphics course. I did the first course in the series and found it enlightening (no pun intended)<p>- Create an e2e project that earns money as a side gig. It's time to put my product and technical knowledge to practice and actually build something people want.<p>- Leverage AI across all my endeavors. AI tools are here to stay and the more I know how to use them effectively, the better. The speed boost in learning a new framework/concept is phenomenal.<p>Non-technical skills:<p>- Expand my social circle - the unstable tech climate made me realize the importance of maintaining a healthy social network. My goal is to connect with more people both inside my company and outside, by both proactively reaching out and going to meetups in my area. In fact, I invite fellow NYC-based HN-ers to contact me at cybercreampuff at yahoo dot com, in case you want to meet up!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

I'm mid 40s, kinda burned out but still struggling forward in my ok-but-not-hollywood IT career, I still have a passion for doing things well in a technical society that values doing things cheap (and well). The things I am known for being good at, I still google daily, and for a long time, I've been hungry for a change - any change - but especially one that isn't chaotically negative. So in 2026, I wanna learn how dirt works. I actually have a giant box of dirt sitting on a shelf at the UNH community co-op soil analysis lab, waiting to give me some kind of data about the soil behind my house. (Or is it dirt? I don't know what I'm getting into). In 2024 I tried growing some corn. It never sprouted. In 2025 I tried growing some corn. It sprouted and a few ears had enough kernels to make one full mouthful. Tasty, but maybe 7 calories of food for a year of effort. So in 2026 I'd like to grow: one entire fully formed ear of sweet corn. Anything else is a bonus. That's what I wanna develop in 2026 - learning how soil works enough to make it make a thing.  Small moves, Ellie. reply",

          "text": "Great hobby! A couple of things about corn. It might not be soil at issue. Germination depends on correct temperature and moisture. Too much moisture the seed will rot or not have enough air to germinate. Too little moisture it won't trigger germination. Too deep it won't germinate, too shallow and germination won't happen either because it will dry out instead of staying moist. Seeds vary in depth they require and some even require light to germinate (doesn't apply to corn). It's a bit of an art figuring out what \"even moisture until germination\" is, and this varies based on soil type. Timing of planting with correct temperature is important. Each kernel of corn has one silk. The silk is analogous to a Fallopian tube with pollen traveling down into the ovary (or kernel of corn in this case). If you have an ear of corn with only a few kernels it's often because pollen didn't land on all the silks. For this reason corn is usually planted in blocks. It's wind pollinated so wind shakes pollen off the tassels or male flowers at the top, down onto the silk. But if you just have one corn plant in isolation, or a row in isolation it's easier for the pollen to just blow away or miss. Planting in blocks or \"array of arrays\" configuration helps the pollen to reach the silk more uniformly as pollen from the surrounding plants is released. reply",

          "text": "That's kinda wild to hear about the corn because I've found corn to be one of the easiest crops to grow. If you want to try again, these are the seeds I last used which had 100% germination and produced plenty of ears of corn. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005MI33BS I've also had a ton of luck growing corn in 5 gallon buckets with holes drilled in the side to allow air into the soil which keeps the roots from balling up (wasting energy that should go into growing ears).  Used potting mix with a handful of lime and a handful of epsom salt, and topped the buckets with mulch to retain moisture. If you're willing to try that approach, this was very similar to my system: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptgJn15TmRM reply",

I have similar years experience and regularly try out AI for development but always find it’s slower for the things I want to build and/or that it produces less than satisfactory results. Not sure if it’s how I use the models (I’ve experimented with all the frontier ones), or the types of things I’m building, or the languages I’m using, or if I’m not spending enough, or if it’s just my standards are too high for the code that is produced but I usually always end up going back to doing things by hand. I try to keep the AI focused on small well defined tasks, use AGENT.MD and skills, build out a plan first, followed by tests for spec based development, keep context windows and chats a reasonable length etc, but if I add up all that time I could have done it myself and have better grasp of the program and the domain in the process. I keep reading how AI is a force multiplier but I’m yet to see it play out for myself. I see lots of posts talking about how much more productive AI has made people, but very few with actual specifics on setup, models, costs, workflows etc. I’m not an AI doomer and would love to realize the benefits people are claiming they get.... but how to get there is the question reply",

The algorithm (PID controller) itself was properly implemented (as there is plenty of data to train on), but it was trying to optimize the wrong thing. There were other similar findings where LLM was doing very stupid mistakes. So I went through a disillusionment stage and kind of gave up for a while. Since then, I have learned how to use Claude Code effectively. I have used it mostly on existing Django code bases. I think everybody has a slightly different take on how it works well. Probably the most reasonable advice is to just keep going and try different kind of things. Existing code bases seem easier, as well as working on a spec beforehand, requiring tests etc. basic SWE principles. reply",

This is where I’ve been at for a while now. Every couple of months I try again with latest models and latest techniques I hear people talking about but there’s very little concrete info there that works for me. Then I wonder if it’s just my spend? I don’t mind spending $30/month to experiment but I’m not going to drop $300/month unless I can see evidence that it’ll be worth it, which I haven’t really seen, but maybe there’s a dependency and you don’t get the result without increased spend?

          "text": "> This is step 3 of “draw the rest of the owl” :-) Fair enough :-) This reminds me about pigeon research by Skinner. Skinner placed hungry pigeons in a \"Skinner box\" and a mechanism delivered food pellets at fixed, non-contingent time intervals, regardless of the bird's behavior. The pigeons, seeking a pattern or control over the food delivery, began to associate whatever random action they were performing at the moment the food appeared with the reward. I think we humans have similar psychology, i.e. we tend to associate superstitions about patterns of what were doing when we got rewards, if they happen at random intervals. To me it seems we are at a phase where what works with LLMs *(the reward) are still quite random, but it is psychologically difficult for us to admit it. Therefore we try to invent various kinds of theories of why something appears to work, which are closer to superstitions than real repeatable processes. It seems difficult to really generalize repeatable processes of what really works, because it depends on too many things. This may be the reason why you are unsuccessful when using these descriptions. But while it seems less useful to try to work based on theories of what works -- although I had skeptical attitude -- I have found that LLMs can be huge productive boost -- but it really depends on the context. It seems you just need to keep trying various things, and eventually you may find out what works for you. There is no shortcut where you just read a blog post and then you can do it. Things I have tried succesfully:\n- modifying existing large-ish Django projects, adding new apps to it. It can sometimes use Django components&HTMX/AlpineJS properly, but sometimes starts doing something else. One app uses tenants, and LLM appears to constantly struggle with this.\n- creating new Django projects -- this was less successful than modifying existing projects, because LLM could not imitate practices\n- Apple Swift mobile and watch applications. This was surprisingly succesful. But these were not huge apps.\n- python GUI app was more or less succesful\n- GitHub Pages static web sites based on certain content I have not copied any CLAUDE.md or other files. Every time Claude Code does something I don't appreciate, I add a new line. Currently it is at 26 lines. I have made a few skills. They are mostly so that they can work independently in a loop, for example test something that does not work. Typically I try to limit the technologies to something I know really well. When something fails, I can often quickly figure out what is wrong. I started with the basic plan (I guess it is that $30/month). I only upgraded to $100 Max and later to $180 2xMax because I was hitting limits. But reason I was hitting limits was because I was working on multiple projects on multiple environments at the same time.  The only difference I have seen is that I have hit the limits. I have not seen any difference in quality. reply",

          "text": "Thanks for the info. I try a mix of things I know well and things I want to play around with. Swift and iOS was something that didn’t work so well for me.  I wanted to play around with face capture and spent a day with Claude putting together a small app that showed realtime video of a face and put dots on/around various facial features and printed log messages if the person changed the direction they were looking (up down left right) and played a sound when they opened their mouth. I’ve done app development before, but it’s been a few years so was a little bit rusty and it felt like Claude was really helping me out. Then I got to a point I was happy with and I thought I’d go deeper in the code to understand what it was doing and how it was working (not a delegation issue as per another comment, this was a play/learning exercise for me so wanted to understand how it all worked) - and right there in the apple developer documentation was a sample so that did basically the same thing as my app, only the code was far simpler and after reading through the accompanying docs I realized the Claude version had a threading issue waiting to happen that was explicitly warned against in the docs of the api calls it was using. If I’d gone to the developer docs in the beginning I would have had a better app, and better understanding in maybe a quarter of the time. Appreciate the info on spend.  The above session was on the $30/month version of Claude. I guess I need to just keep flapping my wings until I can draw the owl. reply",

I am reading between the lines here, trying genuinely to be helpful, so forgive me if I am not on the right track. But based on what you write, it seems to me you might have not really gone through the disillusionment phase yet. You seem to be assuming the models \"understand\" more than they really are capable of understanding, which creates expectations and then disappointment. It seems to be you are still expecting CC to work at a level of a senior professional on various roles, instead of assuming it is a junior professional. I would have probably approached that iOS app by first investigting various options how the app could be implemented (especially as I don't have deep understanding of the tech), and then explore each option to understand myself what is the best one. The options in your example might be the Apple documentation page. It it might be some open source repo that contains something that could be used as a starting point etc. Then I would have asked Claude to create a plan to implement the best option. During either the option selection or planning, the threading issue would either come up or not. It might come up explicitly, in which case I could learn it from the plans. It might be implicit, just included in the generated code. Or it might not be included in the plans or in the code, even if it is explicitly stated in the documentation. If the suggested plan would be based on that documentation, then I would probably read it myself too, and might have seen the suggestion. When reviewing the plan, I can use my prior knowledge to ask whether that issue has been taken into account. If not, then Claude would modify the plan. Of course, if I did not know about the threading issue beforehand, and did not have the general experience about the tech to suspect such as a issue, nor read the documentation and see the recommendation, I could not find the issue myself either. If the issue is not found in planning or progamming, the issue would arise at later stage, hopefully while unit/system testing the application, or pilot use. I have not written complex iOS apps personally so I might have not caught it either -- I am not senior enough to guide it. I would ask it to plan again how to comprehenively test such an app, to learn how it should be done. What I meant by standard SWE practices is that there are various stages (requirements, specification, design, programming, testing, pilot use) where the solution is reviewed from multiple angles, so it becomes likely that this kind of issues are caught. The best practices also include iteration. Start with something small that works. For example, first an iOS application that compiles, and shows \"Hello, world\" etc. and can be installed on your phone. In my experience, CC cannot be expected to independently work as a senior professional on any role (architect, programmer, test manager, tester, pilot user, product manager, project manager). Junior might not take into account all instructions or guidance even if it is explicit. But it can act as a junior professional on any of these roles, so it can help senior professional to get the 10x productivity boost on any of these areas. By project manager role, I mean that I am explicitly taking the CC through the various SWE stages and making sure they have been done properly, and also that I iterate on the solution. On each one of the stages, I take the role of the respective senior professional. If I cannot do it yet, I try to learn how to do it. At the same time, I work as a product manager/owner as well, to make decisions about the product, based on my personal \"taste\" and requirements. reply",

I mean I'm definitely still in the stage of disillusionment, but I'm not treating LLMs as senior or expecting much from them. The example I gave played out much as you described above. I used an iterative process, with multiple self-contained smaller steps, each with a planning and discussion stage where I got the AI to identify ways to achieve what I was looking to do and weigh up tradeoffs that I then decided on, followed by a design clarification and finalisation stage, before finally getting it to write code (very hard sometimes to get the AI not to write code until the design has been finalised), followed by adjustments to that code as necessary. The steps involved were something like: - build the app skeleton - open a camera feed - display the feed full screen - flip the feed so it responded as a mirror would if you were looking at it - use the ios apis to get facial landmarks - display the landmarks as dots - detect looking in different directions and print a log message. - detect the user opening their mouth - play a sound when the mouth transitions from closed to open - etc Each step was relatively small and self-contained, with a planning stage first and me asking the AI probing/clarifying questions. The threading issue didn't come up at all in any of this. Once it came, the AI tied itself in knots trying to sort it out, coming up with very complex dispatching logic that still got things incorrect. It was a fun little project, but if I compare the output it just wasn't equivalent to what I could get if I'd just started with the Apple documentation (thought maybe it's different now, as per another commenter's reply).

          "text": "I'm pretty sure I have the right intellectual and emotional understanding of the AI and its abilities. > I consider this to be partly what I mean by \"LLM is a junior\" and that \"I act as the project manager\". And this is partly what I mean when I say the time I spend instructing the \"junior\" LLM could be just as well spent implementing the code myself - because the \"project manager\" side of me can work with the \"senior dev\" side of me at the speed of thought and often in parallel, and solving the challenges and the design of something is often where most of the time is spent anyway. Skills are changing this equation somewhat due to the way they can encode repeatable knowledge, but not so much for me yet especially if I'm trying things out in radically different areas (I'm still in my experimental stage with them). > Could you really have done a complex mobile app alone in one day without knowing the stack well beforehand? No, but that's not what happened here. The mobile app wasn't complex (literally only does the things outlined above) and I've done enough mobile development and graphics/computer vision development before that the stack and concepts involved weren't completely unknown, just the specifics of the various iOS APIs and how to string them together - hence why I initially thought it would be a good use case for AI. It was also an incredible coincidence that the toy app I wanted to build had an apple developer tutorial that did almost the same thing as what I was looking to build, and so yes, I clearly would have been better off using the documentation as a starting point rather than the AI. That sort of coincidence won't always exist, but I've thinking lately about another toy iOS/apple watch application, and I checked, and once again there is a developer tutorial that closely matches what I'm looking to build.  If I ever get around to experimenting with that, the developer docs are going to be my first port of call rather than an AI. > I certainly could not have done one year ago what I can do today, with these tools. Right, and if you look back at my original reply (not to you), this is what I'm trying to understand - the what and how of AI productivity gains, because if I evaluate the output I get it's almost always either something I could have built faster and better, or if not faster then at least better and not so much slower that the AI was enabling a week of work to be done in a day, and month of work to be done in a week (claims from the GP, not you). I would love to be able to realize those gains - and I can see the potential but just not the results. reply",

Ok. I have done similar, too. For example, when starting a new Django project, I will rather copy an old project as basis than create a new from scratch with LLM. If there already exists full documentation or repo of exactly what you are trying to do and/or it is something you have already done many times, then LLM might not add too much value, and may even be a hindrance. reply",

          "text": "I’m perfectly comfortable and used to delegating, but delegation requires  trust that the result will be fit for purpose. It doesn’t have to be exactly how I would do it but at a minimum it has to work correctly and have acceptable performance for the task at hand. This doesn’t mean being super optimized just that it shouldn’t be doing stupid things like n+1 requests or database queries etc. See a sibling comment for one example on correctness, another one related to performance was querying some information from a couple of database tables (the first with 50,000 rows the next with 2.5 million) After specifying things in enough detail to let the AI go, it got correct results but performance was rather slow. A bit more back and forthing and it got up to processing 4,000 rows a second. It was so impressed with its new performance it started adding rocket ship emojis to the output summary. There were still some obvious (to me) performance issues so I pressed it to see if it could improve the performance.  It started suggesting some database config tweaks which provided some marginal improvements but was still missing some big wins elsewhere - namely it was avoiding “expensive” joins and doing that work in the app instead - resulting in n+1 db calls. So I suggested getting the DB to do the join and just processing the fully joined data on the app side. This doubled throughout (8,000 rows/second) and led to claims from the AI this was now enterprise ready code. There was still low hanging fruit though because it was calling the db and getting all results back before processing anything. After suggesting switching to streaming results (good point!) we got up to 10,000 rows/second. This was acceptable performance, but after a bit more wrangling we got things up to 11,000 rows/second and now it wasn’t worth spending much extra time squeezing out more performance. In the end the AI came to a good result, but, at each step of the way it was me hinting it in the correct direction and then the AI congratulating me on the incredible “world class performance” (actual quote but difficult to believe when you then double performance again). If it has just been me I would have finished it in half the time. If I’d delegated to a less senior employee and we’d gone back and forth a bit pairing to get it to this state it might have taken the same amount and effort but they would’ve at least learnt something. Not so with the AI however - it learns nothing and I have to make sure I re-explain things and concepts all over again the next time and in sufficient detail that it will do a reasonable job (not expecting perfection, just needs to be acceptable). And so my experience so far (much more than just these 2 examples) is that I can’t trust the AI to the point where I can delegate enough that I don’t spend more time supervising/correcting it than I would spend writing things myself. Edit: using AI to explain existing code is a useful thing it can do well.  My experience is it is much better at explaining code than producing it. reply",

When I’m writing my own code I can verify the logic as I go and coupled with a strong type system and a judicious use of _some_ tests its generally enough for my code to be correct. By comparison the AI needs more tests to keep it on the right path otherwise the final code is not fit for purpose. For example in a recent use case I needed to take a json blob containing an array of strings that contained numbers and needed to return an array of Decimals sorted in ascending order. This seemed a perfect use case - a short well defined task with clear success criteria so I spent a bunch of time writing the requirements and building out a test suite and then let the AI do its thing. The AI produced ok code, but it was sorted everything lexicographically before converting to a Decimal rather converting to Decimals first and sorting numerically so 1000 was less than 900. So I point it out and the AI says good point, you’re absolutely correct and we add a test for this and it goes again and gets the right result but that’s not a mistake I would have made or needed a test for (though you could argue it’s a good test to have). You could also argue that I should have specified the problem more clearly, but then we come back to the point that if I’m writing every specific detail in English first, it’s faster for me just to write it in code in the first place. reply",

If it fails, it’s not allowed to edit the source code, instead it must determine if there is a bug in the test or the source code. If the test is buggy it should try again, if there is a bug in the source code it should pause, propose a fix, and consult with you on next steps.

I am not going to just deny myself access to apps on schedule -- my brain never clicked schedule, not even once in my life -- but through a persistent and sustainable self-change from deep within. It's slow but it's beginning to work. - MANDATORY: Get more intimate with my Neovim. I've always kind of half-arsed my editors / IDEs, I always found it annoying to become a deep expert. This must change; surface-level skills rob you of productivity. I already am hugely annoyed by my typing speed, which is quite excellent but still not enough to work almost at the speed of thought. I want to achieve something near to these levels. - OPTIONAL: Integrate closer with one ore more LLM agents for coding. I have not paid for any yet but copying-pasting from a web UI gets tiring. Sometimes you really just want to say \"OK, now remove that duplicate test and include that edge case\" and see it materialize in 20 seconds. I am not against paying, it's just that so far the paid tiers have not been a blocker. Well, seems like they are now. - MANDATORY: Prioritize body. I have health conditions and I have a relatively good visibility how to fix them. I regularly end up desperately trying to solve more and more problems on the computer just so I don't get up and start a workout. I started turning this around but it's way too slow and time and age don't wait for anyone. In general: connect better with myself, forgive myself all the previous mistakes, understand why and how they came to be and remove the root causes, put myself on a better path. And above all: be more true to myself. reply",

          "text": "I would not even know how to call my so-called \"technique\" if somebody else did not do it for me: awareness. What I do I would today call \"reconciliation\" or \"making peace\". Let me explain. On the one hand, I start recognizing in a colder, more methodical and mathematical manner, what things I did screw up in my life and why. I drill down and understand what emotions, unmet needs and un-addressed trauma led to these faulty decisions. Then I say: I understand why I did it but this only worked against me, it's time to change it and put myself on a better path. And by \"better path for me\" I don't mean only financial and career success; I mean those _and_ being happier and calmer. On the other hand, I allow my more beastly / primitive / emotional / immature side to show up. I don't shun it, I try to sympathize with it and somewhat validate it. That's basically treating a part of yourself like an angry and lost kid: you do feel for them but want them to stop doing damage. But you also want to not force anything on them; you want them to understand and internalize they are only hurting themselves and others (in this case: other parts of you) with zero benefit for anyone involved. --- It's not easy. I had a very rocky start in life. Sure I did not sleep under bridges but growing up in a shitty Eastern European town with a gay brother and you yourself being the nerd who effortlessly gets all A grades and is also good at karate, physically attractive and liked by girls sadly had a ton of downsides that many people are blind of. Almost everyone hates you for being different and they feel threatened by you while all you want is to fit in and be a part of a friendly group. It was and still is a big tragedy, one I don't claim I have managed to come to terms with even as of today. --- But what I do lately is talk to my more primal side: \"Look, I really understand how much you hate doing X and Y. I hate them too! But what else would you do? We did it your way for so long, you had an almost complete full reign and look what happened -- now we all suffer from severely diminished physical and mental health, we hate our life and often our work, we know that we wasted our best years on pointlessly rebelling against things we could never change. Where did all that bring us? Please, work with me. I understand that you never feel heard because we never achieved the life you wanted. But I can't see any shortcuts. Do you? If not, then let us please take the long but much safer road to our goals. That way we'll still get there one day. If we are not making progress then we'll talk again and readjust strategy and maybe do things more your way. But in the meantime, can we do things my way for a while? Please?\" Or something very similar. But all that is 99% specific to me. You really have to find your own way to your deeper and more primal / emotional side. It exists and very often sabotages you because you never give it the wheel. Being civilized does this to us and no, I am not saying you should go outside and beat someone to death with a ratchet wrench of course. I mean that you should find a way to do the things you truly want, regardless of the cost. I am NOT doing this well at the moment. For example I am too chicken to give up programming. But as mentioned above, I am trying to reconcile a few factors the best way I can for the moment. Maybe if that unlocks more energy and more motivation then the time would be ripe for more drastic measures. One step at a time. reply",

          "text": "I feel the exact same way and my career path and years in the industry are pretty much the same as well. What's usually blocking me from giving other programming niches a try is that I can't imagine ever building something in them that people actually use. Everything I've studied so far has been grounded in practicality and building a compiler, for example, seemed like something that only a select few can build with good quality. Anyway, I got the \"Writing An Interpreter In Go\" book and I think I'll give it a shot either way. I think I'm at a point in my career where I'm finally tired of building the same things again and again. I've also been thinking about doing a design course in Interaction Design Foundation just to get my mind interested in things again and detach myself from the work I've been doing. reply",

Seems like kind of strange / yet somewhat appropriate choice since Forth \"traditionally use neither operating system nor file system.\" and \"A full-featured Forth system with all source code will compile itself\".  Bootstrap your own operating system on a computer with literally nothing. Interesting to read about though as a tangent, very different kind of language.  \"grammar has no official specification\"  \"looks the word up in the dictionary\" and then does whatever the dictionary specifies. Good luck on the project though, seems like it fell out of use in the 80's and only got recovered recently.  The Forth Interest Group comments on the subject are funny too. [1]  \"What ANS Forths are available?\" -> \"The simple answer is: none\"  Apparently somebody (Vincent Hamp) got it to work on Thumb-2 ISA (ARMv7-M and newer) though.  Tiny.  7kb flash, 320B of ram.

          "text": "The primary virtue of a Forth system is that it is interactive.  You can see this on any 1990s system that can start up in Open Firmware. I've started with a FIG-Forth kernel in 9900 assembler, which fits into 8K.  Many authors worked that code up to the 1990s branch I grabbed. To bring up the board, I cross-assemble to produce two Flash EEPROMs, plug them in, and power up.  The Forth kernel looks at block 6 for customizations where I tell it to compile some source packages I want from Flash.  One of these is -ASSEMBLER, which lets me create short chunks of native machine code to work on very low-level things like bit I/O, the SPI and I2C peripheral behavior.  Very good for debugging initial hardware. When I'm happy with some code, I add the source to the next EEPROM build. Block numbers were originally 1K chunks of disk, but can refer to any kind of storage like pages of ROM/RAM, or even to a process' virtual address space. reply",

          "text": "Similar experience w/ my daughter (now 12 y/o) here. We read the heck out of children's books when she was little. There were nights when I really didn't want to slog thru the same Suzy Spafford[6] book again, but I did it anyway. I think it paid off. My daughter is an avid reader now. She says she still wants me to read to her, so I do. This year was a bit sci-fi heavy, and we've decided to target more fantasy and literature in 2026. This year's books included: \"Below the Root\", \"And All Between\", and \"Until the Celebration\" - The \"Green Sky Trilogy\"[0] by Zilpha Keatly Snyder. We held off on playing the \"Below the Root\" video game[1] but I'm hoping that as we get into winter weather and outside time becomes more scarce we can get to it. It's arguably the final book in the \"trilogy\". \"Redshirts\"[2] by John Scalzi. We've been slowly making our way through Star Trek TOS in the last couple years so. That gave her enough cultural fluency with the tropes in the book to make it effective. \"To Say Nothing of the Dog\"[3] by Connie Willis. My daughter adores Victorian England and comedy. This book also turned her on to Jerome K. Jerome's \"Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog)\"[4] (which I'm still working thru on my own-- I do not particularly love Victorian England but it is a good book). Besides the books I read to my daughter, I also read Martha Wells' \"The Murderbot Diaries\"[5] series myself. I'm vaguely interested in the television adaptation. I'd love to hear what somebody who has read the series thinks of the TV version.

It felt like it was made for fans (the portrayal of the embedded show, Sanctuary Moon, was wonderful and I felt like whoever did their hairstyles had an immense amount of fun), yet accessible without knowing the story. Murderbot’s self-narration was good; I wanted more since it drove so much of the book but what was there in the show carried its personality well. Alexander Skarsgard pulled the character off well. My mental picture of Murderbot from the books was very different but now when I re-read the first book after watching the show, I heard his voice. I still feel slightly sad they didn’t get a more genderless or gender-ambivalent actor (he looks male, the bot was agender before the show) or tried to portray him differently… they could have reduced this but the way they filmed him assigns gender to an ungendered character. The other actors were all excellent too. I felt far more of a sense of them as a team and individuals than I remember from the first book. If you enjoyed the books I think you’ll enjoy the show, except for me that it has changed my picture of Murderbot and I am not sure for the better, in terms of what I felt were social / identity values the books encouraged. reply",

The narration seemed incredibly challenging (and kept making me think of \"A Christmas Story\", of all things). The integration of \"Sanctuary Moon\" sounds particularly fun. I definitely see Murderbot as genderless and seeing it as gendered is going to be weird. Fortunately, the series isn't particularly \"dear\" to me and I think I can deal with the trauma of having my mental pictures wiped-out by somebody else's. (There are properties like \"Neuromancer\" and \"Snow Crash\" that I hope are never adapted to video and, if they are, I will steadfastly refuse to ever see, because I can't imagine anybody else's mental pictures will be better than mine...) reply",

I've never seen \"A Christmas Story\" (Wikipedia shows it as very American-cultural-icon) but reading the synopsis, I'm surprised how many parts of it are semi-familiar, perhaps culturally reflected in other ways.

          "text": "Technical followed by non-technical. I read more than these, but these are the highlights. Mouse, a Language for Microcomputers by Peter Grogono - Mouse is basically an esolang with barely any abstraction facilities, but the book was well-written and the language compelling enough to explore further. Notes on Distance Dialing (pdf) by AT&T - Described the telephone systems of the USA and Canada in the mid-1950s. The reading is a dry as it gets, but it was a fascinating dive into a vastly complex system solving extremely hard problems. This is a must-read for folks interested in systems-thinking. That said, I am actively looking for recommendations for books about the process of designing and building the unbelievably complex telephony system over the rudiments of the earlier systems. Recommendations welcomed! The Eye of Osiris by R. Austin Freeman - This is the first book that I’ve read from Freeman and I suspect that I will read many more in the future. The story follows the disappearance of John Bellingham, Egyptologist and the subsequent investigation. As the investigation stalls, the eminent Dr. Thorndyke digs into the case. The story sets up the mystery nicely and indeed provides enough information to the reader to infer how the disappearance occurred and who or what facilitated it. The book is one of the best whodunits that I’ve ever read. The Mystery of Edwin Drood by Charles Dickens - His final work remains unfinished as he passed away before he could complete it. Further complicating the meta-story is that he also didn’t outline the ending nor even put to paper the “villain” of the story. The meta-mystery of the ending has motivated a mountain of speculation around the ending including dozens of continuations of the story from other authors, all deriving their pet endings from textual hints, accounts from Dickens’ friends, illustration notes, and even in some cases seances supposedly accompanied by the spirit of Dickens himself. What was written by Dickens is spectacular and a compelling mystery and although it would be great to know the resolution, in some ways the “Droodiana” that has cropped up over the past 150+ years is reason enough for it to remain a mystery. The whole lore around Edwin Drood is a worthwhile hobby in itself and well-worth exploring. The Chiltern Library edition of the book contains the story and a good bit of the lore around the writing and the meta-works available at the time of its publication. The Shadow People by Margaret St. Clair - Sadly out of print and difficult to find, but I’ve had it on my shelves for decades and finally got around to reading it. The book came onto my radar in the 1980s when I learned about it in the appendix-n of the 1st edition Advanced D&D Dungeon Masters Guide. I enjoyed many of the books at the time and have slowly swung around to re-reading them over the past few years. Sadly, most on the list do not stand the test of time for me, but St. Clair’s mixture of 60s counter-cultural leanings in a fantasy/sf world still works. The cultural touch-points in the book feel quite dated, but despite the occasional awkwardness, the story is unique even today. Lolly Willowes by Sylvia Townsend Warner - The book started as a passable novel of manners focused on a turn of the century British middle-class family. The titular character was mostly background decoration for the first third of the novel and AFAIR was talked about only in the third-person. It’s only when she made the choice to move out on her own to the country in her middle age does she gain a central role in the narrative and her inner thoughts revealed. This is where things really pick up because I was shocked to learn that this unassuming woman’s inner thoughts had a delicious darkness to them. I don’t want to give away too much, but I’ll just say that you will not expect how the story ends. Patience by Daniel Clowes - A profound graphic novel using time-travel to explore the idea of enduring love with a story that proceed through time, following Jack as he tries to alter the past and save the woman he loves. This well-known science fiction motif is elevated by Clowes’ signature psychological complexity. Narcissus and Goldmund by Herman Hesse - I’ve read most of the books by Hermann Hesse but this one escaped my attention until this year. The story follows the parallel lives of a monk Narcissus and his passionate friend Goldmund as they respectively search for meaning in life through spiritual means and through pleasures of the flesh. We Who Are About To… by Joanna Russ - A small group of astronauts crash land on a hostile alien world and quickly realize that rescue is unlikely to come. Many SF stories have started this way and so the expectation is that this is a colonization story… but Russ thrives on subverting reader expectations. Fifty Forgotten Records by R.B. Russell - Another lovely entry in Russell’s series (one can hope) of autobiographical explorations of art, so far covering literature and now music. This book describes 50 records of varying popularity and Russell’s personal connections to each. While I certainly enjoyed finding a dozen or so new albums to explore, the true triumph of the book lies in the vulnerable, reflective memoir threaded throughout. The Way of All Flesh by Samuel Butler A novel that follows 4-generations of the Ponitifex family, with a particular bildungsroman-esque thread around Ernest, a young man who’s naivete leads to his downfall and how his life unfolds thereafter.

          "text": "Sci-fi nerd recommendations follow. I binged the entirety of the Dungeon Crawler Carl series. The cover, & the fact that it was on Kindle Unlimited, made me think it was probably cheap crap, but I was impressed with how well-written it was, and how much I empathized with the characters. (I probably should have read it slower; by the last two books, I was just flowing with the text, not paying as much attention to the overarching plot.) Heinlein's \"Orphans of the Sky\" was pretty bad. So much early scifi is considered great because it's groundbreaking, writing about things nobody else has before. The concept of a generation ship was pretty new at the time Heinlein was writing it, and it has some very interesting concepts, but the book has some really bad problems . If you've read it, you know; if you haven't, and decide to, you'll see it for yourself. I binged a few Brandon Sanderson books. The standalones are great; the Stormlight Archive is a huge slog through some beautiful writing, but I'm not sure I'm willing to spend so much time in beautiful books that move the plot forward so slowly. Exordia, by Seth Dickinson, started off incredible, kept going, but the ending felt like both a fizzle as well as a cliff-hanger for the next book. I'm glad I read it, but I wish it had a clear conclusion it wanted to reach. Adrian Tchaikovsky's \"Children of Memory\" delivers more of the great philosophical questions & answers about the nature of consciousness and personhood that the previous books did, A+. No idea where he could possibly go from there, but if he does, I'm going along for the journey. (Honorable mention: Alien Clay. Dishonorable mention: Service Model.) Eric Flint's \"Fenrir\" was a fun BDO near-future space adventure. (As was John Sanford's Saturn Run, but that wasn't a 2025 book I read.) reply",

You can now read lots of those stories on-line (like at https://www.freesfonline.net/Magazines2.html ).  Some of them have stood the test of time, but some are really really bad.  John Campbell, the editor of Analog back then, was racist, and also convinced that smoking tobacco was a Good Thing.  Many of the stories were written (by others) to convey those ideas; it's almost unusual for lead characters not to light up a cigarette. It will be interesting to see how much of today's scifi holds up half a century from now---not because the science is wrong, but because the moral qualities will be judged outlandish. reply",

          "text": "I'm not influential enough but I'll share the recommendations I think will help people like me: struggling parents. This year I've reread The Discontented Little Baby Book. If you're getting/have a newborn, this is the book I'd read. It's humane. No sleep training, no nonsense about babies. We went full ‘possum’ with our baby and I like how happy he became. I've also read Ten Things I Wish You Knew About Your Child's Mental Health. To me this could be an instant classic. No fluff, lots of advice for parents. Prima. There's plenty of literature on parenting, but so much of it is poorly written or poorly researched. Be careful out there. (And don't read PLS, yikes.) --- I finally discovered Andy Weir, the Thursday Next series, and The 13.5 Lives of Captain Bluebear. I'm amazed it took me so long to get there. All excellent. For some reason I decided to read all 7 Harry Potters in French. If you're learning French, it's a great idea, the French gets progressively harder so you can keep up! Bryson's At Home: A Short History of Private Life has been my companion for some weeks, but it's quite long. I'm happy with all my reading this year, some 32 books, many in a foreign language. Given I've no time to read during the day, and can only get some pages in after the kid's in bed, it's not too shabby. Oh, and we've read Stompysaurus, like, 90 times? Grawwwwr!

Here's some quotes to give you a feel: \"The smartphone is the electrical stunner in the slaughterhouse of society\" \"You’ll be able to access any TV or radio station in real time, around the world, talk to people overseas in high resolution video with live translations for free and be bored by it\" \"In the future the hermetic spaces of solitude will be breached as we build a global village. The private will become public and, ironically, the public will become private as the streets empty of experiences taken indoors, inside of bedrooms, beneath our screens of glowing grace.\" It's intentionally meant to be ambitious, brutal and challenging.

Here's my log for 2025, most recent at the top. Currently I am slogging my way through Heinlein's \"The Number of the Beast\" which I'm not a fan of. Halfway done with it though! Gabrielle Zevin, \"The Hole We're In\" (not my usual genre, enjoyed this though) Robert A. Heinlein, \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" (pretty good) Robert A. Heinlein, \"Time Enough for Love\" (PHENOMENAL, highly recommended) Robert A. Heinlein, \"Methuselah's Children\" (pretty good, required to understand \"Time Enough for Love\") Richard K. Morgan, \"Altered Carbon\" (very good) Robert A. Heinlein, \"The Rolling Stones\" (young adult, but good all the same) Robert A. Heinlein, \"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\" (very good) Piers Anthony, \"On A Pale Horse\" (very good, never got very far into the series though) Lincoln Child, \"Full Wolf Moon\" (okay, not great) Lincoln Child, \"The Forgotten Room\" (pretty good) Lincoln Child, \"The Third Gate\" (very good) Lincoln Child, \"Terminal Freeze\" (okay, not great) William Gibson, \"In the Beginning… Was the Command Line\" (good, but outdated, look up what he's said about it more recently) Lincoln Child, \"Deep Storm\" (very good) James Patterson, \"Along Came a Spider\" (not my usual genre, okay though) Jules Verne, \"Around the World in 80 Days\" (from childhood, revisited) reply",

          "text": "My top book of the year: Fryderyk Chopin: A Life and Times , Alan Walker A riveting read by a legendary musicologist and biographer.  Walker spent about ten years researching this.  It is 700 pages, which seems daunting but he makes this authoritative bio absolutely enjoyable.  It's also a \"corrective biography\", it dispels a lot of myths.  This book is one of the best examples of accessible writing with flair.  What a writer! Throughout the book, Walker tastefully quotes musical phrases (in notation) from Chopin's works to situate them in context.  I often paused reading and put on the track on a given page (nocturnes, mazurkas, preludes, etc).  It made the reading experience incredibly rich and fun.  Other things I enjoyed: Chopin's letters to his friends and family, life in aristocratic salons of Paris, London, Warsaw, and more—Chopin had unparalleled access.  Of course, there's also a lot of gut-wrenching stuff.  As the book's blurb says, it really is for both the casual music lover and the professional pianist. If you haven't discovered them yet, give a listen to Chopin's nocturnes.  But please, give them an attentive listen and play them on a high-quality audio system.  Here[1] is one of his finest nocturnes (it is less famous than the \"happier\" nocturne that follows it, Op. 9 No. 2).

But please -- you don't need to \"blast\" this music. This is not rock :-) Yes, there are a lot of \"dynamics\" (soft and loud and some gradations: pianissimo , forte , etc), but don't overthink it. Just use a reasonably high-end speaker (e.g. I use an old, Bose \"SoundTouch 20\") and pick one of the recent recordings from Deutsche Grammophon.

Kindle app syncs between devices, and makes it easier to read a few pages here and there instead of waiting for uninterrupted sessions with my Kindle. 3. Continually updating a To Read list, mostly by going to Barnes and Noble, taking pictures of featured book tables, then adding the interesting ones to my Libby hold list. 4. Borrowing with Libby makes it easier to bail out of a book that doesn't intrigue me.

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I am a college student and for my entire life I have been lonely. This is probably taken a very heavy toll on my mental health but that’s another story. I’ve never been able to make friends and keep meaningful connections that last a long time. In fact I’d go as far as saying I have never had a friend, and I currently don’t have any. My phone is empty, when I go to school nobody talks to me and when I do find people who seem to have some kind of interest in me, it usually doesn’t last very long since they don’t prioritize whatever we have. As far as I’m aware I am tolerable to be around. People find me funny and when I do talk to people we have decent conversations (though small talk tends to bore me). However that doesn’t lead anywhere and doesn’t bring me any kind of comfort or fulfillment. I’ve attributed my lack of friends to something that places all the blame on me. Maybe I’m ugly, maybe I’m not funny enough, maybe I’m dumb. I don’t know if that’s the right approach. But I’ve tried so many different things, I’ve read so many different books and yet I still can’t get anyone to even bother to ask me how my day was or care to actually do something and hang out with me when I ask if they’d like too.<p>What am I supposed to do? Be lonely and without any kind of company and human connection my entire life?</p></div>",

The more needy you are and craving for attention the more unattractive and uninteresting you look as a person. The only solution for these types of problems (aside of usual phychotherapy/physiology that you need to rule out first with help of professionals!) - is to genuinely stop giving a single damn whether you're alone or not. Right after that moment you will become much much more attractive as a person. And you will release a ton of energy to focus on things that are more important (like your life goals etc). But you can't fool yourself and pretend that you don't care while still being worried about the outcomes inside. It's not \"fake it till you make it\" type of inner game. That is a key to your problem (after you solved main mommy/daddy issues if any with a decent therapist). No amount of shallow \"be yourself, be interested in others\" advice will help until you have a foundation to be congruent in these tactical actions. But if you have that foundation that type of advice is mostly redundant. reply",

          "text": "A lot of advice of what you should do, putting the burden on action which is likely to worsen your depression and self-worth image. So let me offer an alternative, healthier way of dealing with discomfort, especially of the soul: the first step is accepting the situation and making the best of it. Issues of loneliness aren't easily solved by joining the church or the cricket club, despite many comments along those lines; it's good to realise that loneliness sticks with us and gets more painful when around people. You won't ever feel so lonely as in a crowd. There is a difference between loneliness and solitude. Learn solitude. Learn to be comfortable with yourself. Know yourself, and chances are, you don't have a clue about yourself at 19, and you probably won't be for a few more decades of self-reflection, so get started. Then, when you'll find comfort in yourself, comfort in being by yourself, joy even, you'll be ready to face that door that is the cause of your great sadness today. And you'll come from a place where companionship is no more a matter of life-and-death, but from a more mature position that understand that people come and go, might love you and might hurt you, but the only constant source of joy, respite and calm lies within you, and it's been there all along. I'm not sure any of this would've made any sense to my 19 years old self, but no one sat down to explain this to me either, so I hope it strikes a chord. Just don't blame yourself for an ill society where connection is ever harder. -- a fellow lonely person that found joy in solitude, appreciating those heartfelt, fleeting moments with worthy humans. reply",

          "text": "After a life with no friends, I found meaning and purpose in my faith, which helped me grow out of my antisocial behaviors.  Joining a faith community at the start of my college years gave me a safe space to interact as I matured, and that changed my life. My childhood was a life of constant transition.  Despite my outgoing personality, we moved often, so I had few acquaintances and no lasting friends.  Critically, I rarely saw my father, a socially, athletically, intellectually, financially successful man whose affirmation and guidance I would have benefitted from.  With no friends and no dad I was adrift. In my teens I began to idealize romantic companionship, but my emotional neediness drove away anyone I was interested in.  This feedback loop (loneliness causing antisocial behavior, reinforcing loneliness) needed to be broken. The turn around in my life was  coming to faith in Jesus in college.  I started consistently attending a campus Bible study, and made several lifelong friends, and many more positive relationships.  With an active, relationship oriented community, I no longer craved romantic validation, so my disposition to women gradually shifted from neediness to cordially but confidently focusing on other things.  It took a few years for this dynamic to mature in me, but by the time I was a college senior, several women around me started expressing interest in me — something I’d never experienced before.  A couple of them were not my type, but one in particular turned out to be a generous, agreeable woman with a kind family, who was also quite gorgeous, someone my younger self never could have attracted.  I married her, and now I get to be the father that I never had to our children. Reading your post reminds me of the ache I felt as a young man.  But I think that if you find your purpose, you can find your people.  And while you never fully “arrive” there is a peace you get just from journeying in the right direction. reply",

I don't think there is any way to diagnose this and pinpoint the problem. Learning how to be social is very much a lot like learning how to program: try lots of things, spend a lot of time doing it, and don't be afraid of breaking things. Eventually you'll develop your own methods to keep people entertained and then people will take more interest in you. Been there, done that. BTW, you're 19 and actually at 19 this is not all that abnormal. Lots of kids in college find themselves in your situation. reply",

Also, as Charlie Munger always said: \"Invert! Invert! Invert!\". Try doing the opposite of what you normally do. This requires of course paying attention to what you normally do (or don't do). Instead of waiting for others to reach out to you, for example, you might instead approach them. Be okay with the fear of rejection. When we are kids we make friends so easily because we haven’t yet learned to protect ourselves from rejection. An interesting exercise I had to do recently as part of a teambuilding exercise: offer a hug to 5 random  strangers. I promise this will teach you something about yourself, and about others. reply",

You don't need to be pretty, funny, or smart to make friends and have meaningful, deep relationships. Like seriously, it's extremely important to understand that it really doesn't have anything to do with you. One mistake I made when I was in university was have a baseline assumption that I was unlikable or similarly flawed, hence I would always find reasons why someone disliked me and pushed them away as a defence mechanism. Regardless of if it's true it's a horribly unproductive mindset to have and I encourage you to fight it. Also you won't make friends by reading books.

          "text": "If I may be so bold, the fallacy here is of time. Dare I say, you are already surrounded by friends, and not noticing it. It seems like you measure \"friendship\" not by the time spent with them when you go to events or in school, but what happens afterwards. In other words, you are discounting to zero the moments that are actually happening in your life, for an imagined future of what a friendship might turn out to be. But life only ever happens moment to moment. That time that you spend with people at an event, that IS the thing. There is no \"friendship certificate\": some people, you'll only spend ten minutes with; some, you might spend an afternoon with; others you might end up seeing once a week for a term. You might date a girl for a fortnight, or a couple of months, and then break up and never see each other again. It's ALL GOOD. If I understand correctly, none of the above would qualify in your eyes as \"real friendship\", only the deep, deep kind. You might find it helpful to learn about Dunbar's number, and the size of the model's concentric social circles. Most people end up with 1-2 very close friends (possibly including their spouse). That is the outcome over a lifetime of making connections. Popular culture markets this idea that we should all be carousing with a tightly knit group of friends - no statistical social evidence bears this out. When sinking into deep analysis about all your self-perceived inadequacies, your attention beam is directed inwards. That's unhealthy. When it's directed OUT, into the world, it takes you out of your head, and lets you see that everyone, every single one (person or otherwise), is struggling in their own way. Everyone's got a thing. Looking out builds empathy and kindness and affection towards things that make you happy, and gazing inwards makes you miserable. You are surrounded by people in school, and are at a stage in life where you get to be interested in whatever. Any experience you have, even if it doesn't lead to lifelong friendships, is worthy in the space of time it occupies. Throughout my undergrad I had friends come and go. I'm not in touch with anyone I met at Uni during those years.  It doesn't make the actual time spent with these people any less special. reply",

You have a ready supply of people with something in common, you meet them regularly enough to create a bond, and easy ways to engage with them outside of class (\"hey people who attend activity X, shall we do some activity X outside of classes?\"). If you're not very sporty, less sporty things include: - photography - dancing classes (esp if you're a man, IME they are usually in short supply for classes) - hiking / walking groups - book clubs / chess / bridge - quirky sports like roller skating Otherwise, what other say. Other people like being listened to (and their interlocutor remembering what you said to them), that's an accessible trick to bond with people. And finally, it sounds like you don't struggle to build acquaintances - so maybe the tricky bit is \"converting\" them into friendships. I'd say, in case it makes you feel better, that this is very much the common experience, to varying degrees, and the cult of people having lots and lots of friends is, for most, commercial propaganda. reply",

You might not find that _one_ friend easily that can fulfill all your needs in one package, but you can become part of friend groups. Individual connections might grow from that. To get there: 1. Ensure you are in a place where things are happening, e.g. a larger town or city. This just gives you more options, but even small towns have things happening. 2. Become part of social hobbies, where people frequently meet at an organized time and place. e.g. team sports, local theater groups, book club, makerspace, cooking courses, etc...., whatever you have an interest in. Pick more than one if you can. Live firmly in the real world and not online. 3. Show up and keep showing up, you need to become a familiar face to people. One-off gatherings aren't great for this, but work with what you've got. 4. Participate. Are they looking for volunteers for event X, participate. Do they need someone to help do Y, participate. People are getting together to do race Z, participate. Someone needs an hour help moving some stuff, show up. No need to overdo it, just be there and be seen as a reliable part of the group. 5. Be patient. Especially participate in new things or initiatives, the groups are less firmly set in stone and it's easier to become part of something. Plus by participating you'll learn of other things happening in the community. If you \"don't like anything\", work with what's available and pick the things that are most OK. Part of liking things is doing them. If you're in a tiny village where they only play soccer once a week, well guess what, you're going to learn to play soccer now. The activity is the excuse to be around people. \nIf small talk bores you but small talk is what's on offer, have small talk. Life is not a stream of \"big moments\", the mundane is the glue. Do not expect anything. Keep any ego firmly in check. Go with the flow and be relaxed, whatever happens happens. People can smell neediness. Good luck ! reply",

          "text": "Most people are not the ones initiating a hangout with others who they aren't yet friends with, they usually join in when invited if it fits their schedule/they are bored, etc. I'd recommend trying to brush off a bit the feeling of rejection since you don't have these connections yet. It sucks a bit but knowing it's completely normal might help you not feel it's something personal against you. My recommendation is to keep trying with the ones you felt you could potentially click, I also have ADHD but never had much of an issue to make friends, and never made it a \"goal\", I just kept getting interested in people and would try to meet them again, most times it fizzles out even though you can have a nice time together but eventually some people stick around and become friends over time :) Also try to have a well defined event, and be genuine, do things you like and try to invite people you met with these shared interests, in a casual and friendly way, people are more prone to join in when they don't feel there's pressure to do it. I think the 3 first points of this comment [0] touch very much on the core of it, if you can strengthen against the feeling of rejection, and learn to be open and vulnerable (while balancing it to not become oversharing) it can go a long way to make people see and connect with you. Almost everyone is \"in the closet\" somehow, putting up a mask, when people meet someone that shows less of a mask and more themselves they usually will find those interesting.

I see some straight up bad advice being given in here (being obsessed with finding relationships, which is human need does not perpetuate the problem, it is a biological drive to solve it) And some good advice: Be genuinely curious about others. Really listen to them. Look in their eyes when they are talking to you and when you are talking to them. (This has done wonders for me in trying to build community!) For me personally, being christian has helped a little (church ends up being a source of community). Is there any spiritual or religious practice you could find a place of worship to be around others who share your belief with? I'm not trying to impose my faith, but rather my practice of being around those who share my core beliefs. Another thing that really really helped me was getting over my preoccupation with older friends. My closest friend is 30 years older than me. Literally my dad's age. He is a consistent and reliable guy, and despite having somewhat different backgrounds, he's given mid-30s me a LOT of wisdom and encouragement. reply",

It’s just you have to keep putting yourself out there until you ‘find’ or ‘attract’ the right kind of people.\nParticipate in events, be a part of communities. It won’t happen if you consciously try.

If you feel very unhappy or unhappy, ie, not content, more than 30-60% of the time, you'd probably benefit from talking to a therapist and learning about how you can like yourself more.

Judging from these descriptions: > I’m socially anxious and keep to myself > small talk tends to bore me > it’s exhausting always having to text them to hang out, if I don’t then we never talk again It's highly possible that you have undiagnosed autism spectrum disorder. I say this because I am reading a book right now about ASD[0] and a lot of this is ringing true, especially the part about being confused why friends are dropping you. Speak to a psychologist and see what they think (or read the book first, and then speak to them). I am 30 now and am just cluing in that I might be on the spectrum, and oh boy do I wish I had caught it when I was younger. (It's also possible that you don't have ASD but some other condition like avoidant personality disorder, but whatever it is, it is so much easier to solve it once you've figured it out.)

Turn yourself into a billboard, wearing T-shirts for things you like (bands, geeky things, etc). A \"cool shirt\" comment can start a conversation. Start smoking. Ok, don't do that. But when I was in school it gave me a reason to congregate in the smoking section of campus. Terrible idea, but it did help me meet some people that almost 30 years later I still consider friends. > What am I supposed to do? Be lonely and without any kind of company and human connection my entire life? You won't be. I'm 48 now, and while I'm somewhat well adjusted, when I was your age, and even a bit older, I was such an introverted outcast. Still am, I just learned how to communicate better over time and more or less relate to people where they are, even if we are different. We all grow at different rates. That doesn't help your sense of loneliness today, but as you discover yourself and who your \"tribe\" is, those connections will form and grow, even if it seems impossible today. reply",

I have colleagues and acquaintances who I get along with. I'm also married with children. I always found it hard to make and keep friends. I was badly bullied at school and felt worthless and didn't have the confidence at that time to make friends, though I couldn't see it, but I really wanted to, I just didn't know how. At the time I was lonely and depressed. I joined the military just before I was your age and had buddies until I left and it was the military that sorted me out. With the benefit of age and lack of hormones I've come to accept that I have no friends for reasons. It doesn't bother me anymore. I've also realised I'm not a good friend, I make no effort, I'm not really interested in other people and find their problems annoying. I'm difficult and I don't really like people. And I like my own company. Do I worry about loneliness? No, but I often wonder if I didn't have my family would I get lonely... I don't know. All I know is that at the moment I'm not and I don't think I will be. But change is constant. All this is to say that you're young, it's likely not as bad as you think it is right now (I don't say this to lessen what you feel), and you will get passed this. Just be yourself, do what interests you and make the effort, even if it's not reciprocated. There's no shame in making unappreciated effort. Move on and don't over-think shit.

If you're one of those people then it's going to suck, especially in the beginning.

The people you find will almost invariably be interesting weirdos, and enriching to be around in a way that people from the centre tend not to be.

Once your general state of health/emotional well-being improves, you'll see that this state of craving others also fades. So how do you improve your well-being/health? The cornerstone should be paying attention to your body, your sensations, feelings and listening. Resting well when tired. Eating well. Noticing your thoughts, especially negative thoughts about yourself. Learn to be kinder to yourself.

          "text": "> People find me funny and when I do talk to people we have decent conversations (though small talk tends to bore me).\n> However that doesn’t lead anywhere and doesn’t bring me any kind of comfort or fulfillment You have two good things going for you here: - you're able to hold a conversation with people, even if it might not be as deep a conversation as you'd like it to be. - you're funny and can joke around with people. It sounds like you might have some surface level relationships and want deeper connections with people, which is totally understandable. Small talk can be boring at first, but it often opens the possibility of deeper relationships. I'd recommend low-stakes/activity based social interactions and seeing where they take you. Some ideas: - If you're on your way to the dining hall to get a meal, ask your dorm mates if they wanna join - Colleges have a movie night on weekends to see a movie for free, ask class mates, dorm mates to go. - Does your campus have like a rec/game center (think pool, air hockey, games etc). Another thing to ask people to. You might have to suffer through a lot of rejection before you get takers. After that you might have to suffer through small talk about the weather, where someone is from, what their major is, etc before you get to the deeper connections. reply",

Your things will most likely be different. A lot of people will tell you to join clubs etc. This is more or less the right answer with the caveat being that you most likely will not make “real” friends from these if you’re not open to connection. I was in jazz ensemble my first two years of college and made 0 friends. It wasn’t until after therapy/getting into a relationship with someone from a dating app that I started making friends.

People will just drop in. If your uni has college basketball or football, become a fan of the team and go to the games or watch em in the dorm. In college you have tons of people around you with all sorts of different backgrounds. Rest assured, someone will have common interests with you and will find you fascinating. You don't need a lot of friends in this life, just a few good ones. Not everyone will like you, that's okay.

TikTok as well. Delete them and watch if you start to feel better. As for the other. Most friends I’ve ever met went like this: meet at an event relating to a shared interest (first you have to go to things, next you have to talk to people): find a person I genuinely like and respect, talk to them, do something together (study, eat, coffee), listen more than you talk, try to be as good a friend to them as possible. And I’m easy. Anyone wants to be my friend and I’ll be theirs. (So long as they treat me as a friend —don’t get me started about people who claim to be friends but who don’t treat me like a friend). This leads me to having some really weird friends. This also leads me to having friends who always treat me right. I’m an introvert so I tend to prioritize small numbers of deep connections over many shallow friendships. Everyplace I go I find the person I like best and I try to get to know them. I talk to them, listen, hear what they’re about, engage with things they find interesting. At 19 you’ve never had a friend? I honestly don’t believe it. I suspect you’re experiencing a depressive episode that is clouding your memory. Every child has had a friend. In grade school or middle school. Call your mother and ask her (I’m serious). I honestly think you’re not remembering clearly. It happens, I don’t know how to fix it, but looking for it might’ve a start. (If you haven’t I’d start looking for something you’re doing that drives people away. But I honestly don’t think you could be doing something without knowing it) Join clubs for things you find interesting. Get a job doing things you find interesting. Do favors for people, ask favors of people. Look for friendships in unlikely places. I once became friends with a professor who I did computer work for. We just got along.

          "text": "Talk to a specialist like a therapist. Have them give you an honest assessment of how you present yourself. Maybe there's something you're doing or saying, or even the way you look, that you're not aware of and has caused people to keep their distance from you. Given how long you've claimed you've been like this, it's very likely behavioral; you're giving off some characteristic that is telling most people you meet that you're not worth spending time with. It might be something as simple as avoiding eye contact, or strange body language, or not knowing how to hold even a rudimentary, surface-level conversation. These are all skills that can be learned, especially when you're still young. I was in a similar situation when I was younger; grew up relatively isolated, barely had any friends, etc. I was socially deprived and abused as a child, and have a speech impediment that has made socializing difficult at times, but I learned how to listen and ask questions and get to know people, and I actually became quite the social butterfly for a good chunk of my 20s and 30s. Now that I'm older, I'm back to being more isolated for personal reasons, but my life is different now and I don't care as much about it, nor am I as reliant on social connections as I used to be. Frankly, I never felt I fit in anywhere, nor have I ever truly liked anyone beyond whatever immediate social gratification I needed filling in the moment. Friendships and connections have always been fleeting, overhyped, and overblown to me, especially when I look back at my life so far and struggle to think of anyone I still care about. Social connections are important when you're younger, but I've found the older you get, the less important they become, especially if you're smart about how you live your life. reply",

          "text": "I am guessing everyday you are getting a chance to make a friend, but somehow it doesn’t work out. So let’s invert it: what prevents/kills friendships? - lying (for whatever reason)\n- talking too much about yourself\n- not asking people about their lives\n- being too private\n- being too judgmental\n- not empathizing - e.g. someone tells you about something hard they’re experiencing and you change the subject\n- not caring to help (also showing you don’t care about others that aren’t in your friend-zone)\n- not offering help\n- not being kind\n- not smiling (more like makes it hard for people to approach you) Most of us want/need friends. Most of us want/need to talk to others about our lives. Someone just moved to where you live. They need a friend. They will strike a conversation w anyone. Even people in your past probably wanted to be your friend (either coz they thought you were cool or they just needed a friend) - you can still be friends with them. I’ve become friends w people I met long after meeting them. Asking someone how they are is not so much about the other person. It’s mostly a social ritual. But if no one is asking you how you are, they might also be intimidated by you. As Aaron Burr would say: talk less, smile more - jk, do more of both. reply",

          "text": "This may not make you feel better, but I was lonely until maybe age 25. That was the year I graduated and started my first job and made my first two real friends. Before that I sat alone in the back of the lecture hall in University and hated on all the fun-having classmates. Age 25 was also when I met my first girlfriend that lasted less than a year. Age 34 was when I met my second girlfriend, who became my wife, and how we are separated. Long story short, I'm pretty content with my life now. You can say I'm a bit of a late bloomer. I thought I would be alone forever too, so much so that in college I aspired to be a Buddhist monk. What helped me was learning how to be less socially awkward through work interactions. When I was 32 I solo backpacked Europe which made me seem like a more interesting person. Also I'm a bit of a people pleaser and I was helpful to some key people in my life and they are now my good friends. Also I saved and invested a good chunk of my income which kind of helps overall with confidence. > People find me funny and when I do talk to people we have decent conversations (though small talk tends to bore me). However that doesn’t lead anywhere and doesn’t bring me any kind of comfort or fulfillment. I’ve attributed my lack of friends to something that places all the blame on me. Maybe I’m ugly, maybe I’m not funny enough, maybe I’m dumb. I've felt all those things at some point. You don't have to be attractive or funny or a genius. I've always walked around with these recurring fantasies of being some secretly impressive superhero that saved the day publicly or had all these amazing talents and everyone would realize my worth. I realize now that everyone is too into their own lives to care, and even if they seem to admire something about you, they see it from the perspective of how it benefits themselves. This is absolutely fine, and human. I guess what I'm saying is that you'll grow out of this phase. Right now I have all the friends I could ever want, ironically at a phase I'm my life I want to be more solitary. reply",

(You can also try to self-diagnose via the Interne, your favorite LLM, or just skimming the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5 , but that's a risker option due to false positives and noise.) If you do have a well-studied issue such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder that interferes with socialization, you can find support groups and people who have been able to succeed even with those issues. Some of these social problems (e.g, ones caused by missing childhood socialization experiences) are curable through practice, but others will require you to learn enough about human social behavior to mask until someone figures out a cure. It can be exhausting, (just like physical exercise can be exhausting) but it's a useful skill to have in order to do well in life. Good luck. reply",

You can join tour groups and visit some cool places. Don't do this to specifically find friends but you will be part of a group and have companionship for a brief period. Thirdly - dating. You will be able to find a partner. This is most peoples main companion in life. Fourthly - you could join a non-work team where you can have social interactions.

Not everything is news. There’s always a mix of real information, FUD, and gossip. If you treat all of it the same, burnout is inevitable. You need to train yourself to scan and decide which discussions are worth going into and which aren’t. This applies to any kind of forum or group chat. If I’m happy? I see HN less as a place for joy and more as a place to know what’s going on. It’s still useful. There’s a lot of BS mixed in, and that’s just part of the deal. It’s not a defining part of my happiness or my life, almost like a newspaper. I just ignore the sloppy posts, be it AI or non-AI related. reply",

Its 'fun' because i think i like to discuss but i have often than not the feeling i have to explain things While you mentioned LLMs: I do think that simplifing what LLMs are to a statistical parrot, shows how little people on hn know about LLMs, at least the ones commenting on it and repeating this every time.

Remember when everyone was an Elon Musk fanboy and Tesla was going to save the world? I'm sure there are more, but that's just off the top of my head. There's always going to be a prevailing zeitgeist, and that's always going to dominate people's focus. But by and large, HN is the most intelligent, thoughtful community I've encountered, with people going out of their way to be kind and thorough in their replies, discussing things maturely, disincentivizing unhelpful and low-effort behavior. Not to mention the dizzying wealth of knowledge and experience the people here have. Obviously it's not 100%. There are plenty of harsh people and attitudes. But there's a lot of good discussion happening here, and that's what I try to focus on. I can only hope one day to be as interesting/inspiring a member of the community as some of the people I've seen on here. reply",

Keep it in the password manager so they can easily use it anywhere Once the emails are managed, setting up parental controls on the devices themself should be easy. On another note, keep the barrier low. Let them figure out a way to get past it. This is what they actually want to learn about, and by doing this it kinda \"forces\" them.

          "text": "I never switched away from listening to my own music collection, so my experience may not be useful to you. Here's the setup I have. I run Kodi as my music server at home, with a NAS that contains all of my music. My collection is quite large and continues to grow. I get most of my new music on CDs (usually purchased at the merch table at live performances) or through Bandcamp these days, although I'm open to any source that allows me to have unencumbered lossless recordings. This allows me to use Kodi's native front end when I'm listening on my home sound system, to use a web front end to play on any web-connected computer, and to stream from my server to my smartphone when I'm out and about. It's the best of all worlds. I have all the convenience of a streaming service, but I actually own the music and it will never become suddenly unavailable or replaced by inferior versions, and I don't have a fixed recurring cost just to enjoy music. Plus, a ton of great music is simply not available on any commercial streaming platform and this eliminates that issue. I don't tend to use MP3s, though. I go with FLAC instead. Kodi will transcode the FLACs to other formats if needed. reply",

          "text": "I (somewhat) recently switched from using MP3s to using streaming services. Personally, my music taste (and the amount of tracks that I listen to) is way more varied now than it was before, but I suppose that depends both on how you use streaming services and how you use local MP3s. Back when I still used exclusively MP3s, I used Music on Console Player [0] on my personal computer and Snae Player [1] on my school's chromebook, since we were only allowed to use web apps on our Chromebooks. On my phone I found VLC [2] to be the best app since it has so many features. I can highly recommend both programs. I still have all three installed and use them whenever I don't have internet. Although I haven't updated my local music library in a while, so I am reminded of my old music tastes whenever I open either of them.

If there is something I like listening to then I must have local copies of it or it does not exist as far as I am concerned.  The internet is too fragile to depend on.  Companies come and go.  Songs get censored, altered or cancelled based on societal identity politics.  The internet and power distribution could vanish in one gamma ray burst. Nobody will believe it can happen until it does. App: I put the songs on MP3 players connected to a tiny mixer and my 1990's sound system.

          "text": "I’m slowly working on rigel.sh, a next generation Remote Desktop solution. Not AI related, but I got tired of janky desktop streaming / remote management solutions (I use the windows app on my Mac and Raspberry Pi Connect online) so I decided to build my own. You install a client on the system you want to manage and enroll it with a single command, just like Tailscale. I’ve built a nice web application were users can manage and access their devices, setup monitoring and configure alerts (for now it only tracks basic stuff like CPU/RAM…) The whole thing uses WebRTC for p2p connections and it’s very snappy because all the graphics pipeline is fully custom (all the enconding/decoding is platform-specific too) and I’ve managed to get latency and quality on par with Parsec in many scenarios (I still have some work to do here because it’s not my thing) I plan on making the whole thing open source with a permissive license and also offer a paid SaaS early in 2026 (I think early February?). I plan on offering a hobby free tier and then paid business/pro features but time will tell! I haven’t event built a landing page yet but if you are interested write me to ramon@rigel.sh reply",

I originally built it for myself because I was subscribed to too many conference channels on YouTube and things started getting messy, so I wrote a script to fetch the new talks automatically and send myself an email once a week. Eventually, I turned it into a newsletter. I currently have over 7,600 subscribers with email open rate consistently between 32%-35%, although I plan to trim the list soon to get into the 40-50% range.

          "text": "After few years of work, I have launched https://gethly.com this year, so I will keep on working on it. It is a platform for content creators to sell their digital content or build paid membership communities. In essence it is a paywall. Main idea was to give creators a single place for selling digital content, so no need to put their e-books or music on other platforms, or to use third party chat and forum servers to run their community. They can sell access via membership or make one-time sales of digital content or access to hosted content, receive donations, etc... best part is that no one else is able to offer a minimum sale price of 1 cent, as no payment processors are involved. So no fees and minimum are imposed. Which incentivises users to make purchases. Albeit it is more about maintenance than adding some new features right now. I implemented almost all I wanted already. The only thing I would like to work on is support for live video streaming, as that involves video ingress, video encoding and video distribution. It is a solid piece of work to take a swing at. But it makes no financial sense at this time as video is the most expensive thing to tackle on the web. Hopefully next year I'll get more exposition with time and more customers to make it financially viable. As for other projects, I was thinking about making yet another reverse proxy, with a twist(which I won't reveal). That could make it something people would be willing to pay a few bucks for over the open sourced ones. I am not fully on board with it, as the time investment here will likely be at least half a year, so I am still just toying with the idea and whether to go ahead. And lastly, I am kinda thinking about making a game. My first. I am doing research and found out Go can totally handle it, which surprised me as I am a Gopher and really LOVE working with Go. Most games today are \"made\" in C#, which is also a language with GC and Go beats it in every aspect in performance. Plust next year, Go will have the new Greentea GC as default, so it will be even more performant. Knowing this made me excited about the idea of making a game without the need to learn a completely new language, ecosystem and rewire my brain to think differently(memory management and whatnot). I tried some things with Raylib already and that got me REALLY excited about the possibilities. I am not sure about the game just yet. So far I know I want it to be heavy storytelling game, not combat or strategy, as I am a good writer. Right now I am enticed either by victorian era setting or middle ages and the main purpose is to take the player on an adventure. reply",

Here's a short document about the sandbox in the context of it's use in my project: https://github.com/jacobsparts/agentlib/blob/main/docs/sandb... I also have a version that uses SUID instead of unprivileged user namespaces, available by request. I often use claude code with --dangerously-skip-permissions but every once in a while it bites me.  I've learned to use git for everything and put instructions to always commit BEFORE writes in CLAUDE.md.  Claude can go off the rails on harder bug fixes, especially if there are multiple rounds of context compacting, it can really screw things up.  It usually honors guidance not to modify outside of the project, but a simple sandbox adds so much, after the session is over you can see what changed and decide what to do with it.  It really helps with the problem where it makes unexpected changes to the codebase, which you might not even notice otherwise, which can introduce serious bugs.  The permission models of all the coding agents are rough--either you can't get anything done, or you throw caution to the wind.  Full sandboxes are quite restrictive, which is why I rolled by own.  Honestly your best option right now is just to have good version control and run coding agents in dedicated environments. reply",

The biggest benefit is probably that it makes it easier to start stuff when I'm out - feels like a much better use of downtime like I'm not waiting to get home to start a session after I have an idea. The monorepo tooling is a bit win too, for a bunch of things I just have 1 way to do it and clear instructions for them to use the binaries that get bundled into new sessions so it gets things \"right\" more often. reply",

Don’t rely only in just the posts. \nI recently deleted every post on my linkedin with the goal of starting building in public and following this method which is the answer to your question. I belong to a paid community of very successful bootstrapped business developers and this is what the top members do, granted they are very successful and paid people to write their content which can be time consuming. reply",

There is a huge hurdle to produce good video content, it takes a lot of time to record, edit and publish quality videos.

Record in segments, with a full reset between each segment. Makes editing really fast. 3. Don't stress about small mistakes. People are into authenticity, it's ok. Lighting/\"studio\" design is still an art, but you can get something set up in a day or two. The harder part is coming up with good video ideas, and doing a compelling title/thumbnail/hook. That's a rabbit hole. If you have a social media following you can leverage that. Cold calls can work if you're selling big ticket items, but you also need to be good at sales and do a lot of legwork so I wouldn't go down that route. I wouldn't start advertising until you can demonstrate product market fit. reply",

Writing something that is commercially successful starts by identifying a potentially commercial product. In other words, you need to start by Marketing, not programming. You're looking for 3 things; A market you can reach;\nThat have money to spend;\nThat are prepared to spend money to make some pain go away. It might be obvious that a market might exist (say something that makes govt more effective) but selling to govt requires enormous resources you don't have. It might be obvious a market exists (a tool for refugees to apply for aid) but they have no money to buy anything from you. It might be obvious a market exists (trips to the moon) but you can't build that. Once you have found a market you can reach, who have some money, and are willing to spend (perhaps with a deposit) then (and only then) should you start coding.

Not big influencers, micro-creators with a few thousand very engaged followers. If you offer a simple performance-based deal (e.g., a small reward for each signup or free premium access for their audience), many will happily try your tool because there's no upfront cost for them. Give them a short demo, a clear value story, and a unique link so they can track referrals. A single well‑matched micro-influencer can easily get you your first 100 real users.

What I’ve been trying recently is to treat “visibility” as a side effect of building, not a separate activity. A few things that seem at least directionally helpful for me: • Sharing my work-in-progress on social platforms — not launches, but the actual process: what I’m building, problems I hit, and how I solved them. This feels more like documenting than promoting. • Writing about concrete technical or product decisions I made, especially when I had to compare different approaches or tools. Those posts sometimes get picked up organically because they’re useful on their own. • Analyzing competitors carefully, then selectively submitting my product to directories or communities where similar tools already exist. I avoid mass submission and try to match the audience instead. None of this has “worked” in a big way yet, but it feels sustainable and doesn’t get me blocked or downvoted. For me, that’s already a win. reply",

Nobody likes having a holiday on two Thursdays followed by work on Friday. Nor do we want to encourage people to carry vacation days to the next year. So we're happy to take the bulk time off at least, and it gives time for people to arrange school paperwork. It is technically a sin in Islam to celebrate other religious holidays. Heck, if you want to go deep into the dogma, everything besides the two Eids shouldn't be celebrated and that includes Prophet Muhammad's birthday and New Year's. But you'll see very heated debates about this that I won't go into. Christmas lies in a weird place on this spectrum. Some say Abrahamic holidays are fine, some say most 'Islamic' holidays are blasphemy. People argue about the Santa hats too. However, Christmas food is perfectly halal. Turkey, peppermint, non-alcoholic egg nog, various desserts. You'll see \"end of year\" dinners by Muslim restaurants that cater to this. Culturally, many of us do have Christian family and friends. So it is a convenient time to meet family and just have an excuse to cook complex Western dishes once a year. Gift giving is rare. You'll see secret Santa stuff at the workplace and in schools. 90% of people in the region do not have disposable income, so expensive gifts are frowned on, as they create pressure. Most are under $25, like fancy soap, snacks, chocolate, a power bank. There's also a culture where charity should be hidden, so stuff usually gets put in a box with no names and the boxes are pseudorandomly distributed. reply",

As well as the idea that some ancient Hebrews miraculously survived in a cave. I also like the idea that the celebrations start with advent like they do in Germany or that there are “12 days of Christmas” ending with the epiphany,  which is a real astronomical event which is part of the explanation of why Christians celebrate the day that they do.

Yes, I know slaves must be set free after seven years. That doesn’t suddenly make it okay and it’s painful to watch people use that as a justification. > technological achievements of the last centuries Christians love to claim these advancements for themselves as long as it fits their story. Much of our mathematical advancements come from the Muslim world. And plenty of scientists that changed the world were under prosecution of Christianity. But it is convenient that a doctor (who has spent years learning about the human body) can remove your bad gallbladder then attributing it to your god. Unless you’re a type of Christian that doesn’t believe in surgery, then it’s “of the devil”. > without risk of being scalped alive? Well, as long as you’re not a Palestinian trying to survive a genocide that is in part supported by fundamentalist Christians on the other side of the planet.

Or Confucius? Genghis Khan? Julius Caesar? Because Jesus was not the most influential man in the history of the world. He was influential, but the world is bigger and history deeper than Christians want to believe. Hell, the only reason anyone even still cares about Jesus is because the Roman emperor Constantine decided Christians were more valuable to him fighting in his army than being fed to lions. If not for him, Christianity would have just been another weird Levantine cult and would have probably died out. So why not celebrate Constantine's birthday instead? Or the Apostle Paul's birthday? It was his idea to spread the faith to gentiles after all, and one could argue modern Christianity is more influenced by Paul than Jesus. This is not an opportunity for you to proselytize me. reply",

But there were many enlightened men before and after him. There were many other emperors. But no more figures like jesus, even modern eastern gurus often mention him and reference him as an example. Paul and others were important for the religion yes, but without jesus and powerful message, influence there would have been nothing to work with. There a tons of examples in history of very popular jesus-like figures with even larger initial traction that nobody even knows today. So accidentally or not - he is the winner. Why not celebrate that. And i assume that history is bigger than christians want to believe, cant know for sure, im not one. The comment was not about the religion at all. reply",

[0] You wouldn’t want people to destroy the world economy by being devout, would you? Pride, Greed, Envy, Lust, Anger, Gluttony, Laziness. \nFrom the cited article: > Pride. Pride is the will to omnipotence. It’s the greatest of sins, and yet it’s everywhere: big business and the elites impose their rules on the world, new technologies are increasingly transgressive (AI, transhumanism, space conquest, etc.), skyscrapers are being built ever taller, etc. In one way or another, the biggest companies reflect this pride. > Greed. Greed is the excessive attachment to money, and the contemporary economy is based on the constant quest for profit. The accumulation of wealth, tax havens and excessive speculation are all modern forms of greed. > Envy. Envy is a deep-seated vice: it means wanting what someone else has. These days, marketing and advertising constantly make us dream of other people’s lives, in a competition where everyone tries to compare themselves, without ever being satisfied with what they are and what they have. In particular, social networking platforms … > Anger.  But the modern economy, by creating the best and the worst, generates inhuman inequalities that arouse anger in everyone. > Lust. Lust is the immoderate pursuit of sexual desire. The MindGeek company, which brings together the major platforms of the pornographic industry, including YouPorn, Pornhub, etc., is enjoying worldwide success. > Gluttony. Gluttony, as we all know, is not a passing fancy. It’s a compulsive need for food pleasure. As the modern economy constantly pushes us to consume, it also pushes those who can afford it to eat non-stop… > Laziness. Finally, laziness is not just weariness. It is the refusal of physical, moral and intellectual effort. There you go. We are creating tools that even think for us. So, only a few among us actually believe in the child’s message, and behave accordingly, (actions count, really they do) or at least try to. :-) [0] https://julienchevalier.com/en/the-economy-of-the-7-deadly-s... reply",

          "text": "Not a bug but rather an engineering oversight. Also not hard and it did not affect me, I caught it soon, but it was one of those surprising moments worth mentioning. I have a write-online table in MariaDB and ordering of records is important. I have realised that the database has no such thing as append-only table that stores records in the order they are submitted into the database. Every record has one or more indices, and it is these indices that dictate the ordering and only for the data they index. What I have overlooked is when a transaction A starts, then transaction B starts, the transaction A might have records with smaller keys, as it started sooner, but transaction B commits first with higher keys, which means I end up with out-of-order entries. This is not too bad, actually, it depends on the context and in my case the context was that there were readers constantly waiting for new records. And so if a reader reads records after transaction B commits but not before transaction A commits, the reader will never see new records from transaction A. I have solved it by blocking the readers based on number of active transactions with ordering being considered. I have wrote about it in this blog post, in the \"Event Log and proper ordering of events\" section https://gethly.com/blog/how-of-gethly/event-sourcing-right-w... reply",

Users complained that video was laggy and often froze on their iPhones. My task was to make it perform better - using the browser's built-in player wasn't an option. After profiling, I found two bottlenecks: converting frames to RGB was happening on the CPU and was quite costly, so I rendered the decoded YUV frames directly on the GPU without conversion. Second, I moved all logic off the main thread since our heavy UI was competing for the same resources. The main thread thing was that I was iterating through the frame buffer multiple times per second to select the appropriate frame for rendering. When heavy UI animations occurred, the main thread would block, causing the iteration to complete late - by then, the target frame's timestamp had passed, so it would get skipped and only the next frame would be drawn, creating visible stuttering. reply",

Punting it to 2026. I'm thinking to get the Samsung Galaxy XR and experiment with some VR apps and learn the fundamentals of spatial computing. As an Android mobile developer, that feels like a natural extension.<p>- Complete the \"UCSanDiegoX: Computer Graphics II: Rendering\" computer graphics course. I did the first course in the series and found it enlightening (no pun intended)<p>- Create an e2e project that earns money as a side gig. It's time to put my product and technical knowledge to practice and actually build something people want.<p>- Leverage AI across all my endeavors. AI tools are here to stay and the more I know how to use them effectively, the better. The speed boost in learning a new framework/concept is phenomenal.<p>Non-technical skills:<p>- Expand my social circle - the unstable tech climate made me realize the importance of maintaining a healthy social network. My goal is to connect with more people both inside my company and outside, by both proactively reaching out and going to meetups in my area. In fact, I invite fellow NYC-based HN-ers to contact me at cybercreampuff at yahoo dot com, in case you want to meet up!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

I am pretty sure I'm a 50th percentiler. I'm mid 40s, kinda burned out but still struggling forward in my ok-but-not-hollywood IT career, I still have a passion for doing things well in a technical society that values doing things cheap (and well). The things I am known for being good at, I still google daily, and for a long time, I've been hungry for a change - any change - but especially one that isn't chaotically negative. So in 2026, I wanna learn how dirt works. I actually have a giant box of dirt sitting on a shelf at the UNH community co-op soil analysis lab, waiting to give me some kind of data about the soil behind my house. (Or is it dirt? I don't know what I'm getting into). In 2024 I tried growing some corn. It never sprouted. In 2025 I tried growing some corn. It sprouted and a few ears had enough kernels to make one full mouthful. Tasty, but maybe 7 calories of food for a year of effort. So in 2026 I'd like to grow: one entire fully formed ear of sweet corn. Anything else is a bonus. That's what I wanna develop in 2026 - learning how soil works enough to make it make a thing.  Small moves, Ellie. reply",

          "text": "Great hobby! A couple of things about corn. It might not be soil at issue. Germination depends on correct temperature and moisture. Too much moisture the seed will rot or not have enough air to germinate. Too little moisture it won't trigger germination. Too deep it won't germinate, too shallow and germination won't happen either because it will dry out instead of staying moist. Seeds vary in depth they require and some even require light to germinate (doesn't apply to corn). It's a bit of an art figuring out what \"even moisture until germination\" is, and this varies based on soil type. Timing of planting with correct temperature is important. Each kernel of corn has one silk. The silk is analogous to a Fallopian tube with pollen traveling down into the ovary (or kernel of corn in this case). If you have an ear of corn with only a few kernels it's often because pollen didn't land on all the silks. For this reason corn is usually planted in blocks. It's wind pollinated so wind shakes pollen off the tassels or male flowers at the top, down onto the silk. But if you just have one corn plant in isolation, or a row in isolation it's easier for the pollen to just blow away or miss. Planting in blocks or \"array of arrays\" configuration helps the pollen to reach the silk more uniformly as pollen from the surrounding plants is released. reply",

          "text": "That's kinda wild to hear about the corn because I've found corn to be one of the easiest crops to grow. If you want to try again, these are the seeds I last used which had 100% germination and produced plenty of ears of corn. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005MI33BS I've also had a ton of luck growing corn in 5 gallon buckets with holes drilled in the side to allow air into the soil which keeps the roots from balling up (wasting energy that should go into growing ears).  Used potting mix with a handful of lime and a handful of epsom salt, and topped the buckets with mulch to retain moisture. If you're willing to try that approach, this was very similar to my system: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptgJn15TmRM reply",

I try to keep the AI focused on small well defined tasks, use AGENT.MD and skills, build out a plan first, followed by tests for spec based development, keep context windows and chats a reasonable length etc, but if I add up all that time I could have done it myself and have better grasp of the program and the domain in the process.

There were other similar findings where LLM was doing very stupid mistakes. So I went through a disillusionment stage and kind of gave up for a while. Since then, I have learned how to use Claude Code effectively. I have used it mostly on existing Django code bases. I think everybody has a slightly different take on how it works well.

Every couple of months I try again with latest models and latest techniques I hear people talking about but there’s very little concrete info there that works for me. Then I wonder if it’s just my spend? I don’t mind spending $30/month to experiment but I’m not going to drop $300/month unless I can see evidence that it’ll be worth it, which I haven’t really seen, but maybe there’s a dependency and you don’t get the result without increased spend?

          "text": "> This is step 3 of “draw the rest of the owl” :-) Fair enough :-) This reminds me about pigeon research by Skinner. Skinner placed hungry pigeons in a \"Skinner box\" and a mechanism delivered food pellets at fixed, non-contingent time intervals, regardless of the bird's behavior. The pigeons, seeking a pattern or control over the food delivery, began to associate whatever random action they were performing at the moment the food appeared with the reward. I think we humans have similar psychology, i.e. we tend to associate superstitions about patterns of what were doing when we got rewards, if they happen at random intervals. To me it seems we are at a phase where what works with LLMs *(the reward) are still quite random, but it is psychologically difficult for us to admit it. Therefore we try to invent various kinds of theories of why something appears to work, which are closer to superstitions than real repeatable processes. It seems difficult to really generalize repeatable processes of what really works, because it depends on too many things. This may be the reason why you are unsuccessful when using these descriptions. But while it seems less useful to try to work based on theories of what works -- although I had skeptical attitude -- I have found that LLMs can be huge productive boost -- but it really depends on the context. It seems you just need to keep trying various things, and eventually you may find out what works for you. There is no shortcut where you just read a blog post and then you can do it. Things I have tried succesfully:\n- modifying existing large-ish Django projects, adding new apps to it. It can sometimes use Django components&HTMX/AlpineJS properly, but sometimes starts doing something else. One app uses tenants, and LLM appears to constantly struggle with this.\n- creating new Django projects -- this was less successful than modifying existing projects, because LLM could not imitate practices\n- Apple Swift mobile and watch applications. This was surprisingly succesful. But these were not huge apps.\n- python GUI app was more or less succesful\n- GitHub Pages static web sites based on certain content I have not copied any CLAUDE.md or other files. Every time Claude Code does something I don't appreciate, I add a new line. Currently it is at 26 lines. I have made a few skills. They are mostly so that they can work independently in a loop, for example test something that does not work. Typically I try to limit the technologies to something I know really well. When something fails, I can often quickly figure out what is wrong. I started with the basic plan (I guess it is that $30/month). I only upgraded to $100 Max and later to $180 2xMax because I was hitting limits. But reason I was hitting limits was because I was working on multiple projects on multiple environments at the same time.  The only difference I have seen is that I have hit the limits. I have not seen any difference in quality. reply",

          "text": "Thanks for the info. I try a mix of things I know well and things I want to play around with. Swift and iOS was something that didn’t work so well for me.  I wanted to play around with face capture and spent a day with Claude putting together a small app that showed realtime video of a face and put dots on/around various facial features and printed log messages if the person changed the direction they were looking (up down left right) and played a sound when they opened their mouth. I’ve done app development before, but it’s been a few years so was a little bit rusty and it felt like Claude was really helping me out. Then I got to a point I was happy with and I thought I’d go deeper in the code to understand what it was doing and how it was working (not a delegation issue as per another comment, this was a play/learning exercise for me so wanted to understand how it all worked) - and right there in the apple developer documentation was a sample so that did basically the same thing as my app, only the code was far simpler and after reading through the accompanying docs I realized the Claude version had a threading issue waiting to happen that was explicitly warned against in the docs of the api calls it was using. If I’d gone to the developer docs in the beginning I would have had a better app, and better understanding in maybe a quarter of the time. Appreciate the info on spend.  The above session was on the $30/month version of Claude. I guess I need to just keep flapping my wings until I can draw the owl. reply",

Subjectively interacting with an LLM gives a sense of progress, but objectively downloading a sample project and tutorial gets me to the same point with higher quality materials much faster. I keep thinking about research on file navigation via command line versus using a mouse. People’s subjective sense of speed and capability don’t necessarily line up with measurable outcomes.

I am reading between the lines here, trying genuinely to be helpful, so forgive me if I am not on the right track. But based on what you write, it seems to me you might have not really gone through the disillusionment phase yet. You seem to be assuming the models \"understand\" more than they really are capable of understanding, which creates expectations and then disappointment. It seems to be you are still expecting CC to work at a level of a senior professional on various roles, instead of assuming it is a junior professional. I would have probably approached that iOS app by first investigting various options how the app could be implemented (especially as I don't have deep understanding of the tech), and then explore each option to understand myself what is the best one. The options in your example might be the Apple documentation page. It it might be some open source repo that contains something that could be used as a starting point etc. Then I would have asked Claude to create a plan to implement the best option. During either the option selection or planning, the threading issue would either come up or not. It might come up explicitly, in which case I could learn it from the plans. It might be implicit, just included in the generated code. Or it might not be included in the plans or in the code, even if it is explicitly stated in the documentation. If the suggested plan would be based on that documentation, then I would probably read it myself too, and might have seen the suggestion. When reviewing the plan, I can use my prior knowledge to ask whether that issue has been taken into account. If not, then Claude would modify the plan. Of course, if I did not know about the threading issue beforehand, and did not have the general experience about the tech to suspect such as a issue, nor read the documentation and see the recommendation, I could not find the issue myself either. If the issue is not found in planning or progamming, the issue would arise at later stage, hopefully while unit/system testing the application, or pilot use. I have not written complex iOS apps personally so I might have not caught it either -- I am not senior enough to guide it. I would ask it to plan again how to comprehenively test such an app, to learn how it should be done. What I meant by standard SWE practices is that there are various stages (requirements, specification, design, programming, testing, pilot use) where the solution is reviewed from multiple angles, so it becomes likely that this kind of issues are caught. The best practices also include iteration. Start with something small that works. For example, first an iOS application that compiles, and shows \"Hello, world\" etc. and can be installed on your phone. In my experience, CC cannot be expected to independently work as a senior professional on any role (architect, programmer, test manager, tester, pilot user, product manager, project manager). Junior might not take into account all instructions or guidance even if it is explicit. But it can act as a junior professional on any of these roles, so it can help senior professional to get the 10x productivity boost on any of these areas. By project manager role, I mean that I am explicitly taking the CC through the various SWE stages and making sure they have been done properly, and also that I iterate on the solution. On each one of the stages, I take the role of the respective senior professional. If I cannot do it yet, I try to learn how to do it. At the same time, I work as a product manager/owner as well, to make decisions about the product, based on my personal \"taste\" and requirements. reply",

I mean I'm definitely still in the stage of disillusionment, but I'm not treating LLMs as senior or expecting much from them. The example I gave played out much as you described above. I used an iterative process, with multiple self-contained smaller steps, each with a planning and discussion stage where I got the AI to identify ways to achieve what I was looking to do and weigh up tradeoffs that I then decided on, followed by a design clarification and finalisation stage, before finally getting it to write code (very hard sometimes to get the AI not to write code until the design has been finalised), followed by adjustments to that code as necessary. The steps involved were something like: - build the app skeleton - open a camera feed - display the feed full screen - flip the feed so it responded as a mirror would if you were looking at it - use the ios apis to get facial landmarks - display the landmarks as dots - detect looking in different directions and print a log message. - detect the user opening their mouth - play a sound when the mouth transitions from closed to open - etc Each step was relatively small and self-contained, with a planning stage first and me asking the AI probing/clarifying questions. The threading issue didn't come up at all in any of this. Once it came, the AI tied itself in knots trying to sort it out, coming up with very complex dispatching logic that still got things incorrect. It was a fun little project, but if I compare the output it just wasn't equivalent to what I could get if I'd just started with the Apple documentation (thought maybe it's different now, as per another commenter's reply). It's also easily completeable in a day if you want to give it a try :-)  Apple Developer reference implementation [here]( https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Vision/tracking-th... ). > By project manager role, I mean that I am explicitly taking the CC through the various SWE stages and making sure they have been done properly, and also that I iterate on the solution. On each one of the stages, I take the role of the respective senior professional. If I cannot do it yet, I try to learn how to do it. At the same time, I work as a product manager/owner as well, to make decisions about the product, based on my personal \"taste\" and requirements. Right, this is what I do.  I guess my point is that the amount of effort involved to use English to direct and correct the AI often outweighs the effort involved to just do it myself. The gap is shrinking (I get much better results now that I did a year ago) but still there. reply",

These kind of loops have happened to me as well. It sometimes requires clearing of context + some inventive step to help the LLM out of the loop.

And this is partly what I mean when I say the time I spend instructing the \"junior\" LLM could be just as well spent implementing the code myself - because the \"project manager\" side of me can work with the \"senior dev\" side of me at the speed of thought and often in parallel, and solving the challenges and the design of something is often where most of the time is spent anyway. Skills are changing this equation somewhat due to the way they can encode repeatable knowledge, but not so much for me yet especially if I'm trying things out in radically different areas (I'm still in my experimental stage with them). > Could you really have done a complex mobile app alone in one day without knowing the stack well beforehand? No, but that's not what happened here. The mobile app wasn't complex (literally only does the things outlined above) and I've done enough mobile development and graphics/computer vision development before that the stack and concepts involved weren't completely unknown, just the specifics of the various iOS APIs and how to string them together - hence why I initially thought it would be a good use case for AI. It was also an incredible coincidence that the toy app I wanted to build had an apple developer tutorial that did almost the same thing as what I was looking to build, and so yes, I clearly would have been better off using the documentation as a starting point rather than the AI. That sort of coincidence won't always exist, but I've thinking lately about another toy iOS/apple watch application, and I checked, and once again there is a developer tutorial that closely matches what I'm looking to build.  If I ever get around to experimenting with that, the developer docs are going to be my first port of call rather than an AI. > I certainly could not have done one year ago what I can do today, with these tools. Right, and if you look back at my original reply (not to you), this is what I'm trying to understand - the what and how of AI productivity gains, because if I evaluate the output I get it's almost always either something I could have built faster and better, or if not faster then at least better and not so much slower that the AI was enabling a week of work to be done in a day, and month of work to be done in a week (claims from the GP, not you). I would love to be able to realize those gains - and I can see the potential but just not the results. reply",

Ok. I have done similar, too. For example, when starting a new Django project, I will rather copy an old project as basis than create a new from scratch with LLM. If there already exists full documentation or repo of exactly what you are trying to do and/or it is something you have already done many times, then LLM might not add too much value, and may even be a hindrance. reply",

          "text": "I’m perfectly comfortable and used to delegating, but delegation requires  trust that the result will be fit for purpose. It doesn’t have to be exactly how I would do it but at a minimum it has to work correctly and have acceptable performance for the task at hand. This doesn’t mean being super optimized just that it shouldn’t be doing stupid things like n+1 requests or database queries etc. See a sibling comment for one example on correctness, another one related to performance was querying some information from a couple of database tables (the first with 50,000 rows the next with 2.5 million) After specifying things in enough detail to let the AI go, it got correct results but performance was rather slow. A bit more back and forthing and it got up to processing 4,000 rows a second. It was so impressed with its new performance it started adding rocket ship emojis to the output summary. There were still some obvious (to me) performance issues so I pressed it to see if it could improve the performance.  It started suggesting some database config tweaks which provided some marginal improvements but was still missing some big wins elsewhere - namely it was avoiding “expensive” joins and doing that work in the app instead - resulting in n+1 db calls. So I suggested getting the DB to do the join and just processing the fully joined data on the app side. This doubled throughout (8,000 rows/second) and led to claims from the AI this was now enterprise ready code. There was still low hanging fruit though because it was calling the db and getting all results back before processing anything. After suggesting switching to streaming results (good point!) we got up to 10,000 rows/second. This was acceptable performance, but after a bit more wrangling we got things up to 11,000 rows/second and now it wasn’t worth spending much extra time squeezing out more performance. In the end the AI came to a good result, but, at each step of the way it was me hinting it in the correct direction and then the AI congratulating me on the incredible “world class performance” (actual quote but difficult to believe when you then double performance again). If it has just been me I would have finished it in half the time. If I’d delegated to a less senior employee and we’d gone back and forth a bit pairing to get it to this state it might have taken the same amount and effort but they would’ve at least learnt something. Not so with the AI however - it learns nothing and I have to make sure I re-explain things and concepts all over again the next time and in sufficient detail that it will do a reasonable job (not expecting perfection, just needs to be acceptable). And so my experience so far (much more than just these 2 examples) is that I can’t trust the AI to the point where I can delegate enough that I don’t spend more time supervising/correcting it than I would spend writing things myself. Edit: using AI to explain existing code is a useful thing it can do well.  My experience is it is much better at explaining code than producing it. reply",

When I’m writing my own code I can verify the logic as I go and coupled with a strong type system and a judicious use of _some_ tests its generally enough for my code to be correct. By comparison the AI needs more tests to keep it on the right path otherwise the final code is not fit for purpose. For example in a recent use case I needed to take a json blob containing an array of strings that contained numbers and needed to return an array of Decimals sorted in ascending order. This seemed a perfect use case - a short well defined task with clear success criteria so I spent a bunch of time writing the requirements and building out a test suite and then let the AI do its thing. The AI produced ok code, but it was sorted everything lexicographically before converting to a Decimal rather converting to Decimals first and sorting numerically so 1000 was less than 900. So I point it out and the AI says good point, you’re absolutely correct and we add a test for this and it goes again and gets the right result but that’s not a mistake I would have made or needed a test for (though you could argue it’s a good test to have). You could also argue that I should have specified the problem more clearly, but then we come back to the point that if I’m writing every specific detail in English first, it’s faster for me just to write it in code in the first place. reply",

          "text": "Tip: teach it how to write tests properly. I’ll share what has worked pretty well for me. Run Cursor in “agent” mode, or create a Codex or Claude Code “unit test” skill. I recommend claude code. Explain to the LLM that after it creates or modifies a test, it must run the test to confirm it passes. If it fails, it’s not allowed to edit the source code, instead it must determine if there is a bug in the test or the source code. If the test is buggy it should try again, if there is a bug in the source code it should pause, propose a fix, and consult with you on next steps. The key insight here is you need to tell it that it’s not supposed to randomly edit the source code to make the test pass. I also recommend reviewing the unit tests at a high level, to make sure it didn’t hallucinate. reply",

I am not going to just deny myself access to apps on schedule -- my brain never clicked schedule, not even once in my life -- but through a persistent and sustainable self-change from deep within. It's slow but it's beginning to work. - MANDATORY: Get more intimate with my Neovim. I've always kind of half-arsed my editors / IDEs, I always found it annoying to become a deep expert. This must change; surface-level skills rob you of productivity. I already am hugely annoyed by my typing speed, which is quite excellent but still not enough to work almost at the speed of thought. I want to achieve something near to these levels. - OPTIONAL: Integrate closer with one ore more LLM agents for coding. I have not paid for any yet but copying-pasting from a web UI gets tiring. Sometimes you really just want to say \"OK, now remove that duplicate test and include that edge case\" and see it materialize in 20 seconds. I am not against paying, it's just that so far the paid tiers have not been a blocker. Well, seems like they are now. - MANDATORY: Prioritize body. I have health conditions and I have a relatively good visibility how to fix them. I regularly end up desperately trying to solve more and more problems on the computer just so I don't get up and start a workout. I started turning this around but it's way too slow and time and age don't wait for anyone. In general: connect better with myself, forgive myself all the previous mistakes, understand why and how they came to be and remove the root causes, put myself on a better path. And above all: be more true to myself. reply",

          "text": "I would not even know how to call my so-called \"technique\" if somebody else did not do it for me: awareness. What I do I would today call \"reconciliation\" or \"making peace\". Let me explain. On the one hand, I start recognizing in a colder, more methodical and mathematical manner, what things I did screw up in my life and why. I drill down and understand what emotions, unmet needs and un-addressed trauma led to these faulty decisions. Then I say: I understand why I did it but this only worked against me, it's time to change it and put myself on a better path. And by \"better path for me\" I don't mean only financial and career success; I mean those _and_ being happier and calmer. On the other hand, I allow my more beastly / primitive / emotional / immature side to show up. I don't shun it, I try to sympathize with it and somewhat validate it. That's basically treating a part of yourself like an angry and lost kid: you do feel for them but want them to stop doing damage. But you also want to not force anything on them; you want them to understand and internalize they are only hurting themselves and others (in this case: other parts of you) with zero benefit for anyone involved. --- It's not easy. I had a very rocky start in life. Sure I did not sleep under bridges but growing up in a shitty Eastern European town with a gay brother and you yourself being the nerd who effortlessly gets all A grades and is also good at karate, physically attractive and liked by girls sadly had a ton of downsides that many people are blind of. Almost everyone hates you for being different and they feel threatened by you while all you want is to fit in and be a part of a friendly group. It was and still is a big tragedy, one I don't claim I have managed to come to terms with even as of today. --- But what I do lately is talk to my more primal side: \"Look, I really understand how much you hate doing X and Y. I hate them too! But what else would you do? We did it your way for so long, you had an almost complete full reign and look what happened -- now we all suffer from severely diminished physical and mental health, we hate our life and often our work, we know that we wasted our best years on pointlessly rebelling against things we could never change. Where did all that bring us? Please, work with me. I understand that you never feel heard because we never achieved the life you wanted. But I can't see any shortcuts. Do you? If not, then let us please take the long but much safer road to our goals. That way we'll still get there one day. If we are not making progress then we'll talk again and readjust strategy and maybe do things more your way. But in the meantime, can we do things my way for a while? Please?\" Or something very similar. But all that is 99% specific to me. You really have to find your own way to your deeper and more primal / emotional side. It exists and very often sabotages you because you never give it the wheel. Being civilized does this to us and no, I am not saying you should go outside and beat someone to death with a ratchet wrench of course. I mean that you should find a way to do the things you truly want, regardless of the cost. I am NOT doing this well at the moment. For example I am too chicken to give up programming. But as mentioned above, I am trying to reconcile a few factors the best way I can for the moment. Maybe if that unlocks more energy and more motivation then the time would be ripe for more drastic measures. One step at a time. reply",

          "text": "I am a fullstack frontend leaning engineer of 10 YoE (still employed). In the early days of my career I enjoyed learning about various programming languages and reading technical books (although mostly tutorials, nothing to deep technically). These days I don't do those things anymore because I am now older, a lot of responsibilities, and hobbies that I need to do, and also quite comfortable in my comfort zone in terms of my niche. I don't do anything anymore these days to advance my career in SWE. Maybe because I am quite jaded because job market sucks, and the job itself sucks (making the rich richer), and any extra time I need to do to advance my career is just doing leetcode monkey grind. I want to change it this year. I do CRUD apps, and I am very boxed in my brain, thinking that CRUD apps is the only programming there is. I often marveled at people who create database, compilers, emulators, 3D engines, version controls, text editors, etc. Those people are like wizards to me. I wonder how can I be creative like that? Like, how can you just wake up one day and decide to create magic. I want to learn how to do those. Any advice is appreciated. Also I want to do it in Zig because I've never worked with manual memory management language before, and I figured might as well. reply",

Bootstrap your own operating system on a computer with literally nothing. Interesting to read about though as a tangent, very different kind of language.  \"grammar has no official specification\"  \"looks the word up in the dictionary\" and then does whatever the dictionary specifies. Good luck on the project though, seems like it fell out of use in the 80's and only got recovered recently.  The Forth Interest Group comments on the subject are funny too.

I've started with a FIG-Forth kernel in 9900 assembler, which fits into 8K.  Many authors worked that code up to the 1990s branch I grabbed. To bring up the board, I cross-assemble to produce two Flash EEPROMs, plug them in, and power up.  The Forth kernel looks at block 6 for customizations where I tell it to compile some source packages I want from Flash.  One of these is -ASSEMBLER, which lets me create short chunks of native machine code to work on very low-level things like bit I/O, the SPI and I2C peripheral behavior.  Very good for debugging initial hardware. When I'm happy with some code, I add the source to the next EEPROM build. Block numbers were originally 1K chunks of disk, but can refer to any kind of storage like pages of ROM/RAM, or even to a process' virtual address space. reply",

Probably about 30 times, some stories more. - “Little Shrew’s Day”… probably 25 times. - Many of the “Construction Site” series books, especially the OG “Goodnight, Goodnight, Construction Site”. The “Garbage Crew” and “Airport” books featured heavily. - Started to mix in some “Pete the Cat” titles. - “Detective Dog Nell” got a lot of air play. Lots of others, but those are definitely the frequent fliers. reply",

          "text": "Similar experience w/ my daughter (now 12 y/o) here. We read the heck out of children's books when she was little. There were nights when I really didn't want to slog thru the same Suzy Spafford[6] book again, but I did it anyway. I think it paid off. My daughter is an avid reader now. She says she still wants me to read to her, so I do. This year was a bit sci-fi heavy, and we've decided to target more fantasy and literature in 2026. This year's books included: \"Below the Root\", \"And All Between\", and \"Until the Celebration\" - The \"Green Sky Trilogy\"[0] by Zilpha Keatly Snyder. We held off on playing the \"Below the Root\" video game[1] but I'm hoping that as we get into winter weather and outside time becomes more scarce we can get to it. It's arguably the final book in the \"trilogy\". \"Redshirts\"[2] by John Scalzi. We've been slowly making our way through Star Trek TOS in the last couple years so. That gave her enough cultural fluency with the tropes in the book to make it effective. \"To Say Nothing of the Dog\"[3] by Connie Willis. My daughter adores Victorian England and comedy. This book also turned her on to Jerome K. Jerome's \"Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog)\"[4] (which I'm still working thru on my own-- I do not particularly love Victorian England but it is a good book). Besides the books I read to my daughter, I also read Martha Wells' \"The Murderbot Diaries\"[5] series myself. I'm vaguely interested in the television adaptation. I'd love to hear what somebody who has read the series thinks of the TV version.

          "text": "I read the series and have really enjoyed the TV show. It felt like it was made for fans (the portrayal of the embedded show, Sanctuary Moon, was wonderful and I felt like whoever did their hairstyles had an immense amount of fun), yet accessible without knowing the story. Murderbot’s self-narration was good; I wanted more since it drove so much of the book but what was there in the show carried its personality well. Alexander Skarsgard pulled the character off well. My mental picture of Murderbot from the books was very different but now when I re-read the first book after watching the show, I heard his voice. I still feel slightly sad they didn’t get a more genderless or gender-ambivalent actor (he looks male, the bot was agender before the show) or tried to portray him differently… they could have reduced this but the way they filmed him assigns gender to an ungendered character. The other actors were all excellent too. I felt far more of a sense of them as a team and individuals than I remember from the first book. If you enjoyed the books I think you’ll enjoy the show, except for me that it has changed my picture of Murderbot and I am not sure for the better, in terms of what I felt were social / identity values the books encouraged. reply",

          "text": "Thanks for the analysis. I've been reading it with a thought toward how I might've adapted it for video. The narration seemed incredibly challenging (and kept making me think of \"A Christmas Story\", of all things). The integration of \"Sanctuary Moon\" sounds particularly fun. I definitely see Murderbot as genderless and seeing it as gendered is going to be weird. Fortunately, the series isn't particularly \"dear\" to me and I think I can deal with the trauma of having my mental pictures wiped-out by somebody else's. (There are properties like \"Neuromancer\" and \"Snow Crash\" that I hope are never adapted to video and, if they are, I will steadfastly refuse to ever see, because I can't imagine anybody else's mental pictures will be better than mine...) reply",

Not that it's someone else's vision (for me), just that it would be Netflix/Hollywood Cyber Slash Noir. I can't imagine anything worse than them looking like every other set-in-the-future adaptation. I've never seen \"A Christmas Story\" (Wikipedia shows it as very American-cultural-icon) but reading the synopsis, I'm surprised how many parts of it are semi-familiar, perhaps culturally reflected in other ways.

          "text": "Technical followed by non-technical. I read more than these, but these are the highlights. Mouse, a Language for Microcomputers by Peter Grogono - Mouse is basically an esolang with barely any abstraction facilities, but the book was well-written and the language compelling enough to explore further. Notes on Distance Dialing (pdf) by AT&T - Described the telephone systems of the USA and Canada in the mid-1950s. The reading is a dry as it gets, but it was a fascinating dive into a vastly complex system solving extremely hard problems. This is a must-read for folks interested in systems-thinking. That said, I am actively looking for recommendations for books about the process of designing and building the unbelievably complex telephony system over the rudiments of the earlier systems. Recommendations welcomed! The Eye of Osiris by R. Austin Freeman - This is the first book that I’ve read from Freeman and I suspect that I will read many more in the future. The story follows the disappearance of John Bellingham, Egyptologist and the subsequent investigation. As the investigation stalls, the eminent Dr. Thorndyke digs into the case. The story sets up the mystery nicely and indeed provides enough information to the reader to infer how the disappearance occurred and who or what facilitated it. The book is one of the best whodunits that I’ve ever read. The Mystery of Edwin Drood by Charles Dickens - His final work remains unfinished as he passed away before he could complete it. Further complicating the meta-story is that he also didn’t outline the ending nor even put to paper the “villain” of the story. The meta-mystery of the ending has motivated a mountain of speculation around the ending including dozens of continuations of the story from other authors, all deriving their pet endings from textual hints, accounts from Dickens’ friends, illustration notes, and even in some cases seances supposedly accompanied by the spirit of Dickens himself. What was written by Dickens is spectacular and a compelling mystery and although it would be great to know the resolution, in some ways the “Droodiana” that has cropped up over the past 150+ years is reason enough for it to remain a mystery. The whole lore around Edwin Drood is a worthwhile hobby in itself and well-worth exploring. The Chiltern Library edition of the book contains the story and a good bit of the lore around the writing and the meta-works available at the time of its publication. The Shadow People by Margaret St. Clair - Sadly out of print and difficult to find, but I’ve had it on my shelves for decades and finally got around to reading it. The book came onto my radar in the 1980s when I learned about it in the appendix-n of the 1st edition Advanced D&D Dungeon Masters Guide. I enjoyed many of the books at the time and have slowly swung around to re-reading them over the past few years. Sadly, most on the list do not stand the test of time for me, but St. Clair’s mixture of 60s counter-cultural leanings in a fantasy/sf world still works. The cultural touch-points in the book feel quite dated, but despite the occasional awkwardness, the story is unique even today. Lolly Willowes by Sylvia Townsend Warner - The book started as a passable novel of manners focused on a turn of the century British middle-class family. The titular character was mostly background decoration for the first third of the novel and AFAIR was talked about only in the third-person. It’s only when she made the choice to move out on her own to the country in her middle age does she gain a central role in the narrative and her inner thoughts revealed. This is where things really pick up because I was shocked to learn that this unassuming woman’s inner thoughts had a delicious darkness to them. I don’t want to give away too much, but I’ll just say that you will not expect how the story ends. Patience by Daniel Clowes - A profound graphic novel using time-travel to explore the idea of enduring love with a story that proceed through time, following Jack as he tries to alter the past and save the woman he loves. This well-known science fiction motif is elevated by Clowes’ signature psychological complexity. Narcissus and Goldmund by Herman Hesse - I’ve read most of the books by Hermann Hesse but this one escaped my attention until this year. The story follows the parallel lives of a monk Narcissus and his passionate friend Goldmund as they respectively search for meaning in life through spiritual means and through pleasures of the flesh. We Who Are About To… by Joanna Russ - A small group of astronauts crash land on a hostile alien world and quickly realize that rescue is unlikely to come. Many SF stories have started this way and so the expectation is that this is a colonization story… but Russ thrives on subverting reader expectations. Fifty Forgotten Records by R.B. Russell - Another lovely entry in Russell’s series (one can hope) of autobiographical explorations of art, so far covering literature and now music. This book describes 50 records of varying popularity and Russell’s personal connections to each. While I certainly enjoyed finding a dozen or so new albums to explore, the true triumph of the book lies in the vulnerable, reflective memoir threaded throughout. The Way of All Flesh by Samuel Butler A novel that follows 4-generations of the Ponitifex family, with a particular bildungsroman-esque thread around Ernest, a young man who’s naivete leads to his downfall and how his life unfolds thereafter.

          "text": "Sci-fi nerd recommendations follow. I binged the entirety of the Dungeon Crawler Carl series. The cover, & the fact that it was on Kindle Unlimited, made me think it was probably cheap crap, but I was impressed with how well-written it was, and how much I empathized with the characters. (I probably should have read it slower; by the last two books, I was just flowing with the text, not paying as much attention to the overarching plot.) Heinlein's \"Orphans of the Sky\" was pretty bad. So much early scifi is considered great because it's groundbreaking, writing about things nobody else has before. The concept of a generation ship was pretty new at the time Heinlein was writing it, and it has some very interesting concepts, but the book has some really bad problems . If you've read it, you know; if you haven't, and decide to, you'll see it for yourself. I binged a few Brandon Sanderson books. The standalones are great; the Stormlight Archive is a huge slog through some beautiful writing, but I'm not sure I'm willing to spend so much time in beautiful books that move the plot forward so slowly. Exordia, by Seth Dickinson, started off incredible, kept going, but the ending felt like both a fizzle as well as a cliff-hanger for the next book. I'm glad I read it, but I wish it had a clear conclusion it wanted to reach. Adrian Tchaikovsky's \"Children of Memory\" delivers more of the great philosophical questions & answers about the nature of consciousness and personhood that the previous books did, A+. No idea where he could possibly go from there, but if he does, I'm going along for the journey. (Honorable mention: Alien Clay. Dishonorable mention: Service Model.) Eric Flint's \"Fenrir\" was a fun BDO near-future space adventure. (As was John Sanford's Saturn Run, but that wasn't a 2025 book I read.) reply",

          "text": "I think it's Sanderson's attempt at \"epic fantasy\" and it falls a bit flat for me as well compared to his tighter shorter novels. Of course we have to focus on the world building because it's literally Sanderson's only talent outside of just being a prolific writer. His characters are all very flat and similar. Especially the women. His character arcs are nothing to speak of. His relationship building is cringe worthy. But he always makes interesting worlds and explores the ramifications of culture and magic systems. reply",

You can now read lots of those stories on-line (like at https://www.freesfonline.net/Magazines2.html ).  Some of them have stood the test of time, but some are really really bad.  John Campbell, the editor of Analog back then, was racist, and also convinced that smoking tobacco was a Good Thing.  Many of the stories were written (by others) to convey those ideas; it's almost unusual for lead characters not to light up a cigarette. It will be interesting to see how much of today's scifi holds up half a century from now---not because the science is wrong, but because the moral qualities will be judged outlandish. reply",

If you're getting/have a newborn, this is the book I'd read. It's humane. No sleep training, no nonsense about babies. We went full ‘possum’ with our baby and I like how happy he became. I've also read Ten Things I Wish You Knew About Your Child's Mental Health. To me this could be an instant classic. No fluff, lots of advice for parents. Prima. There's plenty of literature on parenting, but so much of it is poorly written or poorly researched. Be careful out there. (And don't read PLS, yikes.) --- I finally discovered Andy Weir, the Thursday Next series, and The 13.5 Lives of Captain Bluebear. I'm amazed it took me so long to get there. All excellent. For some reason I decided to read all 7 Harry Potters in French. If you're learning French, it's a great idea, the French gets progressively harder so you can keep up! Bryson's At Home: A Short History of Private Life has been my companion for some weeks, but it's quite long. I'm happy with all my reading this year, some 32 books, many in a foreign language. Given I've no time to read during the day, and can only get some pages in after the kid's in bed, it's not too shabby. Oh, and we've read Stompysaurus, like, 90 times? Grawwwwr!

I was parenting out of fear, the typical stuff of staying indoors, sleep schedules, etc. The book has a really chill approach: just go live your life and bring the baby along. That’s how we wanted to parent, but somehow everyone around us got us into a place of fear. Don’t make the kid nap in the dark, that hinders their cortisol/melatonin cycle development. Go have fun together! Good luck, internet stranger :) reply",

A bit like working out at the gym. The other surprise is that once you start reading, you get really quick. Like, surprisingly fast. After a while you notice the words are going by faster. So the effort compounds. When you start you think “my god that took 5 hours of boring reading time to get though” and by book 10 you think “that was 2.5 hours and I learnt a lot and my brain is happy.” reply",

A fiction story about how personal computers have dismantled society over 40 years... it takes place in 1983 and involves a vulnerable opportunistic time traveler who's getting more than he bargained for. Here's some quotes to give you a feel: \"The smartphone is the electrical stunner in the slaughterhouse of society\" \"You’ll be able to access any TV or radio station in real time, around the world, talk to people overseas in high resolution video with live translations for free and be bored by it\" \"In the future the hermetic spaces of solitude will be breached as we build a global village. The private will become public and, ironically, the public will become private as the streets empty of experiences taken indoors, inside of bedrooms, beneath our screens of glowing grace.\" It's intentionally meant to be ambitious, brutal and challenging.

Kindle app syncs between devices, and makes it easier to read a few pages here and there instead of waiting for uninterrupted sessions with my Kindle. 3. Continually updating a To Read list, mostly by going to Barnes and Noble, taking pictures of featured book tables, then adding the interesting ones to my Libby hold list. 4.

          "text": "My top book of the year: Fryderyk Chopin: A Life and Times , Alan Walker A riveting read by a legendary musicologist and biographer.  Walker spent about ten years researching this.  It is 700 pages, which seems daunting but he makes this authoritative bio absolutely enjoyable.  It's also a \"corrective biography\", it dispels a lot of myths.  This book is one of the best examples of accessible writing with flair.  What a writer! Throughout the book, Walker tastefully quotes musical phrases (in notation) from Chopin's works to situate them in context.  I often paused reading and put on the track on a given page (nocturnes, mazurkas, preludes, etc).  It made the reading experience incredibly rich and fun.  Other things I enjoyed: Chopin's letters to his friends and family, life in aristocratic salons of Paris, London, Warsaw, and more—Chopin had unparalleled access.  Of course, there's also a lot of gut-wrenching stuff.  As the book's blurb says, it really is for both the casual music lover and the professional pianist. If you haven't discovered them yet, give a listen to Chopin's nocturnes.  But please, give them an attentive listen and play them on a high-quality audio system.  Here[1] is one of his finest nocturnes (it is less famous than the \"happier\" nocturne that follows it, Op. 9 No. 2).

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I am a college student and for my entire life I have been lonely. This is probably taken a very heavy toll on my mental health but that’s another story. I’ve never been able to make friends and keep meaningful connections that last a long time. In fact I’d go as far as saying I have never had a friend, and I currently don’t have any. My phone is empty, when I go to school nobody talks to me and when I do find people who seem to have some kind of interest in me, it usually doesn’t last very long since they don’t prioritize whatever we have. As far as I’m aware I am tolerable to be around. People find me funny and when I do talk to people we have decent conversations (though small talk tends to bore me). However that doesn’t lead anywhere and doesn’t bring me any kind of comfort or fulfillment. I’ve attributed my lack of friends to something that places all the blame on me. Maybe I’m ugly, maybe I’m not funny enough, maybe I’m dumb. I don’t know if that’s the right approach. But I’ve tried so many different things, I’ve read so many different books and yet I still can’t get anyone to even bother to ask me how my day was or care to actually do something and hang out with me when I ask if they’d like too.<p>What am I supposed to do? Be lonely and without any kind of company and human connection my entire life?</p></div>",

The more needy you are and craving for attention the more unattractive and uninteresting you look as a person. The only solution for these types of problems (aside of usual phychotherapy/physiology that you need to rule out first with help of professionals!) - is to genuinely stop giving a single damn whether you're alone or not. Right after that moment you will become much much more attractive as a person. And you will release a ton of energy to focus on things that are more important (like your life goals etc). But you can't fool yourself and pretend that you don't care while still being worried about the outcomes inside. It's not \"fake it till you make it\" type of inner game. That is a key to your problem (after you solved main mommy/daddy issues if any with a decent therapist). No amount of shallow \"be yourself, be interested in others\" advice will help until you have a foundation to be congruent in these tactical actions. But if you have that foundation that type of advice is mostly redundant. reply",

          "text": "A lot of advice of what you should do, putting the burden on action which is likely to worsen your depression and self-worth image. So let me offer an alternative, healthier way of dealing with discomfort, especially of the soul: the first step is accepting the situation and making the best of it. Issues of loneliness aren't easily solved by joining the church or the cricket club, despite many comments along those lines; it's good to realise that loneliness sticks with us and gets more painful when around people. You won't ever feel so lonely as in a crowd. There is a difference between loneliness and solitude. Learn solitude. Learn to be comfortable with yourself. Know yourself, and chances are, you don't have a clue about yourself at 19, and you probably won't be for a few more decades of self-reflection, so get started. Then, when you'll find comfort in yourself, comfort in being by yourself, joy even, you'll be ready to face that door that is the cause of your great sadness today. And you'll come from a place where companionship is no more a matter of life-and-death, but from a more mature position that understand that people come and go, might love you and might hurt you, but the only constant source of joy, respite and calm lies within you, and it's been there all along. I'm not sure any of this would've made any sense to my 19 years old self, but no one sat down to explain this to me either, so I hope it strikes a chord. Just don't blame yourself for an ill society where connection is ever harder. -- a fellow lonely person that found joy in solitude, appreciating those heartfelt, fleeting moments with worthy humans. reply",

Instead of waiting for others to reach out to you, for example, you might instead approach them. Be okay with the fear of rejection. When we are kids we make friends so easily because we haven’t yet learned to protect ourselves from rejection.

I remember going to this older lady who seemed like she had just gotten off a looong shift. She looked up and gave me the warmest smile and said \"oh this is excellent!

You don't need to be pretty, funny, or smart to make friends and have meaningful, deep relationships. Like seriously, it's extremely important to understand that it really doesn't have anything to do with you. One mistake I made when I was in university was have a baseline assumption that I was unlikable or similarly flawed, hence I would always find reasons why someone disliked me and pushed them away as a defence mechanism. Regardless of if it's true it's a horribly unproductive mindset to have and I encourage you to fight it. Also you won't make friends by reading books.

          "text": "After a life with no friends, I found meaning and purpose in my faith, which helped me grow out of my antisocial behaviors.  Joining a faith community at the start of my college years gave me a safe space to interact as I matured, and that changed my life. My childhood was a life of constant transition.  Despite my outgoing personality, we moved often, so I had few acquaintances and no lasting friends.  Critically, I rarely saw my father, a socially, athletically, intellectually, financially successful man whose affirmation and guidance I would have benefitted from.  With no friends and no dad I was adrift. In my teens I began to idealize romantic companionship, but my emotional neediness drove away anyone I was interested in.  This feedback loop (loneliness causing antisocial behavior, reinforcing loneliness) needed to be broken. The turn around in my life was  coming to faith in Jesus in college.  I started consistently attending a campus Bible study, and made several lifelong friends, and many more positive relationships.  With an active, relationship oriented community, I no longer craved romantic validation, so my disposition to women gradually shifted from neediness to cordially but confidently focusing on other things.  It took a few years for this dynamic to mature in me, but by the time I was a college senior, several women around me started expressing interest in me — something I’d never experienced before.  A couple of them were not my type, but one in particular turned out to be a generous, agreeable woman with a kind family, who was also quite gorgeous, someone my younger self never could have attracted.  I married her, and now I get to be the father that I never had to our children. Reading your post reminds me of the ache I felt as a young man.  But I think that if you find your purpose, you can find your people.  And while you never fully “arrive” there is a peace you get just from journeying in the right direction. reply",

          "text": "If I may be so bold, the fallacy here is of time. Dare I say, you are already surrounded by friends, and not noticing it. It seems like you measure \"friendship\" not by the time spent with them when you go to events or in school, but what happens afterwards. In other words, you are discounting to zero the moments that are actually happening in your life, for an imagined future of what a friendship might turn out to be. But life only ever happens moment to moment. That time that you spend with people at an event, that IS the thing. There is no \"friendship certificate\": some people, you'll only spend ten minutes with; some, you might spend an afternoon with; others you might end up seeing once a week for a term. You might date a girl for a fortnight, or a couple of months, and then break up and never see each other again. It's ALL GOOD. If I understand correctly, none of the above would qualify in your eyes as \"real friendship\", only the deep, deep kind. You might find it helpful to learn about Dunbar's number, and the size of the model's concentric social circles. Most people end up with 1-2 very close friends (possibly including their spouse). That is the outcome over a lifetime of making connections. Popular culture markets this idea that we should all be carousing with a tightly knit group of friends - no statistical social evidence bears this out. When sinking into deep analysis about all your self-perceived inadequacies, your attention beam is directed inwards. That's unhealthy. When it's directed OUT, into the world, it takes you out of your head, and lets you see that everyone, every single one (person or otherwise), is struggling in their own way. Everyone's got a thing. Looking out builds empathy and kindness and affection towards things that make you happy, and gazing inwards makes you miserable. You are surrounded by people in school, and are at a stage in life where you get to be interested in whatever. Any experience you have, even if it doesn't lead to lifelong friendships, is worthy in the space of time it occupies. Throughout my undergrad I had friends come and go. I'm not in touch with anyone I met at Uni during those years.  It doesn't make the actual time spent with these people any less special. reply",

          "text": "+1e9, should be the top answer IMO. Activities create a group of people with a common interest, meeting regularly. You have a ready supply of people with something in common, you meet them regularly enough to create a bond, and easy ways to engage with them outside of class (\"hey people who attend activity X, shall we do some activity X outside of classes?\"). If you're not very sporty, less sporty things include: - photography - dancing classes (esp if you're a man, IME they are usually in short supply for classes) - hiking / walking groups - book clubs / chess / bridge - quirky sports like roller skating Otherwise, what other say. Other people like being listened to (and their interlocutor remembering what you said to them), that's an accessible trick to bond with people. And finally, it sounds like you don't struggle to build acquaintances - so maybe the tricky bit is \"converting\" them into friendships. I'd say, in case it makes you feel better, that this is very much the common experience, to varying degrees, and the cult of people having lots and lots of friends is, for most, commercial propaganda. reply",

          "text": "Most people are not the ones initiating a hangout with others who they aren't yet friends with, they usually join in when invited if it fits their schedule/they are bored, etc. I'd recommend trying to brush off a bit the feeling of rejection since you don't have these connections yet. It sucks a bit but knowing it's completely normal might help you not feel it's something personal against you. My recommendation is to keep trying with the ones you felt you could potentially click, I also have ADHD but never had much of an issue to make friends, and never made it a \"goal\", I just kept getting interested in people and would try to meet them again, most times it fizzles out even though you can have a nice time together but eventually some people stick around and become friends over time :) Also try to have a well defined event, and be genuine, do things you like and try to invite people you met with these shared interests, in a casual and friendly way, people are more prone to join in when they don't feel there's pressure to do it. I think the 3 first points of this comment [0] touch very much on the core of it, if you can strengthen against the feeling of rejection, and learn to be open and vulnerable (while balancing it to not become oversharing) it can go a long way to make people see and connect with you. Almost everyone is \"in the closet\" somehow, putting up a mask, when people meet someone that shows less of a mask and more themselves they usually will find those interesting.

Group therapy can also help, and it can improve your listening and empathy. Aside from that, I’d evaluate your behavior, personally I’ve always struggled with food addiction and often used that as a crutch to deal with loneliness. Be honest with yourself and check your coping mechanisms- playing video games, doomscrolling, alcohol, etc.. It’s easy to think of these things as relatively harmless ways to blow off steam, but over relying on them can change how you interact with the world, and thus how you’re perceived by others. As for more practical suggestions, if you’re into listening to music, see if any of the local venues have shows you’d be interested in. Finding people who are passionate about the same music you are is a great shortcut to finding potential friends. reply",

Really listen to them. Look in their eyes when they are talking to you and when you are talking to them. (This has done wonders for me in trying to build community!)

Try some courses that tend to require higher levels of interaction (like theatre) I wouldn't join a fraternity, but that's a way some connect with others. Turn yourself into a billboard, wearing T-shirts for things you like (bands, geeky things, etc). A \"cool shirt\" comment can start a conversation. Start smoking. Ok, don't do that. But when I was in school it gave me a reason to congregate in the smoking section of campus. Terrible idea, but it did help me meet some people that almost 30 years later I still consider friends. > What am I supposed to do? Be lonely and without any kind of company and human connection my entire life? You won't be. I'm 48 now, and while I'm somewhat well adjusted, when I was your age, and even a bit older, I was such an introverted outcast. Still am, I just learned how to communicate better over time and more or less relate to people where they are, even if we are different. We all grow at different rates. That doesn't help your sense of loneliness today, but as you discover yourself and who your \"tribe\" is, those connections will form and grow, even if it seems impossible today. reply",

Judging from these descriptions: > I’m socially anxious and keep to myself > small talk tends to bore me > it’s exhausting always having to text them to hang out, if I don’t then we never talk again It's highly possible that you have undiagnosed autism spectrum disorder. I say this because I am reading a book right now about ASD[0] and a lot of this is ringing true, especially the part about being confused why friends are dropping you. Speak to a psychologist and see what they think (or read the book first, and then speak to them). I am 30 now and am just cluing in that I might be on the spectrum, and oh boy do I wish I had caught it when I was younger. (It's also possible that you don't have ASD but some other condition like avoidant personality disorder, but whatever it is, it is so much easier to solve it once you've figured it out.)

If you feel very unhappy or unhappy, ie, not content, more than 30-60% of the time, you'd probably benefit from talking to a therapist and learning about how you can like yourself more.

I have colleagues and acquaintances who I get along with. I'm also married with children. I always found it hard to make and keep friends. I was badly bullied at school and felt worthless and didn't have the confidence at that time to make friends, though I couldn't see it, but I really wanted to, I just didn't know how. At the time I was lonely and depressed. I joined the military just before I was your age and had buddies until I left and it was the military that sorted me out. With the benefit of age and lack of hormones I've come to accept that I have no friends for reasons. It doesn't bother me anymore. I've also realised I'm not a good friend, I make no effort, I'm not really interested in other people and find their problems annoying. I'm difficult and I don't really like people. And I like my own company. Do I worry about loneliness? No, but I often wonder if I didn't have my family would I get lonely... I don't know. All I know is that at the moment I'm not and I don't think I will be. But change is constant. All this is to say that you're young, it's likely not as bad as you think it is right now (I don't say this to lessen what you feel), and you will get passed this. Just be yourself, do what interests you and make the effort, even if it's not reciprocated. There's no shame in making unappreciated effort. Move on and don't over-think shit.

          "text": "I am quite a bit older than you, so my perspective is probably a bit different, but I have learned that friendships come from shared situations and experiences. You're not going to get it from books unfortunately, and the \"methods\" described in some books might come across as less genuine. First of all, have realistic expectations. You might not find that _one_ friend easily that can fulfill all your needs in one package, but you can become part of friend groups. Individual connections might grow from that. To get there: 1. Ensure you are in a place where things are happening, e.g. a larger town or city. This just gives you more options, but even small towns have things happening. 2. Become part of social hobbies, where people frequently meet at an organized time and place. e.g. team sports, local theater groups, book club, makerspace, cooking courses, etc...., whatever you have an interest in. Pick more than one if you can. Live firmly in the real world and not online. 3. Show up and keep showing up, you need to become a familiar face to people. One-off gatherings aren't great for this, but work with what you've got. 4. Participate. Are they looking for volunteers for event X, participate. Do they need someone to help do Y, participate. People are getting together to do race Z, participate. Someone needs an hour help moving some stuff, show up. No need to overdo it, just be there and be seen as a reliable part of the group. 5. Be patient. Especially participate in new things or initiatives, the groups are less firmly set in stone and it's easier to become part of something. Plus by participating you'll learn of other things happening in the community. If you \"don't like anything\", work with what's available and pick the things that are most OK. Part of liking things is doing them. If you're in a tiny village where they only play soccer once a week, well guess what, you're going to learn to play soccer now. The activity is the excuse to be around people. \nIf small talk bores you but small talk is what's on offer, have small talk. Life is not a stream of \"big moments\", the mundane is the glue. Do not expect anything. Keep any ego firmly in check. Go with the flow and be relaxed, whatever happens happens. People can smell neediness. Good luck ! reply",

          "text": "I know I'm too being vague, like all other comments in this thread. But my suggestion would be to work on feeling well/good. The energy one emanates is what attracts or pushes other people away. It is of course a very complex topic, how to reach a state of emotional well-being, but you can start by taking better care of yourself, your health and your mood will also improve. Once your general state of health/emotional well-being improves, you'll see that this state of craving others also fades. So how do you improve your well-being/health? The cornerstone should be paying attention to your body, your sensations, feelings and listening. Resting well when tired. Eating well. Noticing your thoughts, especially negative thoughts about yourself. Learn to be kinder to yourself. If you do these things, you'll feel better and you'll become a bit more attractive to others. reply",

It sounds like you might have some surface level relationships and want deeper connections with people, which is totally understandable. Small talk can be boring at first, but it often opens the possibility of deeper relationships. I'd recommend low-stakes/activity based social interactions and seeing where they take you. Some ideas: - If you're on your way to the dining hall to get a meal, ask your dorm mates if they wanna join - Colleges have a movie night on weekends to see a movie for free, ask class mates, dorm mates to go. - Does your campus have like a rec/game center (think pool, air hockey, games etc). Another thing to ask people to. You might have to suffer through a lot of rejection before you get takers. After that you might have to suffer through small talk about the weather, where someone is from, what their major is, etc before you get to the deeper connections. reply",

People will just drop in. If your uni has college basketball or football, become a fan of the team and go to the games or watch em in the dorm. In college you have tons of people around you with all sorts of different backgrounds. Rest assured, someone will have common interests with you and will find you fascinating. You don't need a lot of friends in this life, just a few good ones. Not everyone will like you, that's okay. I'd also recommend talking to a professional, you might need to practice your social interactions. They have groups for this sorta thing if they deem you ready, but there's something more going on that has put you in this situation I'd wager. Good luck! reply",

It might not directly help with loneliness, but it might make your life more satisfactory. That said, while other folks on HN will have some advice you'll find useful, I'm not sure how applicable my experiences are to anyone else. My advice would be to examine the things you're interested in, especially if they're weird or \"cringe\" , and find people who share those interests. Be shamelessly authentic. If you don't have any such interests, I dunno. reply",

          "text": "This isn’t what you asked but I would remove all social media from your phone. Nothing makes you lonelier than social media. Facebook and instagram should be the first to go. TikTok as well. Delete them and watch if you start to feel better. As for the other. Most friends I’ve ever met went like this: meet at an event relating to a shared interest (first you have to go to things, next you have to talk to people): find a person I genuinely like and respect, talk to them, do something together (study, eat, coffee), listen more than you talk, try to be as good a friend to them as possible. And I’m easy. Anyone wants to be my friend and I’ll be theirs. (So long as they treat me as a friend —don’t get me started about people who claim to be friends but who don’t treat me like a friend). This leads me to having some really weird friends. This also leads me to having friends who always treat me right. I’m an introvert so I tend to prioritize small numbers of deep connections over many shallow friendships. Everyplace I go I find the person I like best and I try to get to know them. I talk to them, listen, hear what they’re about, engage with things they find interesting. At 19 you’ve never had a friend? I honestly don’t believe it. I suspect you’re experiencing a depressive episode that is clouding your memory. Every child has had a friend. In grade school or middle school. Call your mother and ask her (I’m serious). I honestly think you’re not remembering clearly. It happens, I don’t know how to fix it, but looking for it might’ve a start. (If you haven’t I’d start looking for something you’re doing that drives people away. But I honestly don’t think you could be doing something without knowing it) Join clubs for things you find interesting. Get a job doing things you find interesting. Do favors for people, ask favors of people. Look for friendships in unlikely places. I once became friends with a professor who I did computer work for. We just got along. He invited me over for dinner with him and his wife. I was on his Christmas list (he made mix cds for people, I still have two he made me) reply",

The problem when you are 19 is you don't realise that you are young. You are already using language like 'my entire life', your entire life is nothing right now, most of that time you were way too young to even have much of a life apart from being a child. So my advice is just relax, it doesn't matter. The issue is you think it does and I get you, because that is what everyone thinks at that age, but trust me when you are older you will understand, the issue is not much is going to help you right now and you prob think I am being a dick. But if you somehow remember this post in ten years time, you will be like 'that guy was right' Go explore and enjoy life. You can do that on your own and the more you do that and the more you can get from that, the more other people will want to be around you and then it will be up to you if you want to let them in or not. reply",

          "text": "Talk to a specialist like a therapist. Have them give you an honest assessment of how you present yourself. Maybe there's something you're doing or saying, or even the way you look, that you're not aware of and has caused people to keep their distance from you. Given how long you've claimed you've been like this, it's very likely behavioral; you're giving off some characteristic that is telling most people you meet that you're not worth spending time with. It might be something as simple as avoiding eye contact, or strange body language, or not knowing how to hold even a rudimentary, surface-level conversation. These are all skills that can be learned, especially when you're still young. I was in a similar situation when I was younger; grew up relatively isolated, barely had any friends, etc. I was socially deprived and abused as a child, and have a speech impediment that has made socializing difficult at times, but I learned how to listen and ask questions and get to know people, and I actually became quite the social butterfly for a good chunk of my 20s and 30s. Now that I'm older, I'm back to being more isolated for personal reasons, but my life is different now and I don't care as much about it, nor am I as reliant on social connections as I used to be. Frankly, I never felt I fit in anywhere, nor have I ever truly liked anyone beyond whatever immediate social gratification I needed filling in the moment. Friendships and connections have always been fleeting, overhyped, and overblown to me, especially when I look back at my life so far and struggle to think of anyone I still care about. Social connections are important when you're younger, but I've found the older you get, the less important they become, especially if you're smart about how you live your life. reply",

          "text": "This may not make you feel better, but I was lonely until maybe age 25. That was the year I graduated and started my first job and made my first two real friends. Before that I sat alone in the back of the lecture hall in University and hated on all the fun-having classmates. Age 25 was also when I met my first girlfriend that lasted less than a year. Age 34 was when I met my second girlfriend, who became my wife, and how we are separated. Long story short, I'm pretty content with my life now. You can say I'm a bit of a late bloomer. I thought I would be alone forever too, so much so that in college I aspired to be a Buddhist monk. What helped me was learning how to be less socially awkward through work interactions. When I was 32 I solo backpacked Europe which made me seem like a more interesting person. Also I'm a bit of a people pleaser and I was helpful to some key people in my life and they are now my good friends. Also I saved and invested a good chunk of my income which kind of helps overall with confidence. > People find me funny and when I do talk to people we have decent conversations (though small talk tends to bore me). However that doesn’t lead anywhere and doesn’t bring me any kind of comfort or fulfillment. I’ve attributed my lack of friends to something that places all the blame on me. Maybe I’m ugly, maybe I’m not funny enough, maybe I’m dumb. I've felt all those things at some point. You don't have to be attractive or funny or a genius. I've always walked around with these recurring fantasies of being some secretly impressive superhero that saved the day publicly or had all these amazing talents and everyone would realize my worth. I realize now that everyone is too into their own lives to care, and even if they seem to admire something about you, they see it from the perspective of how it benefits themselves. This is absolutely fine, and human. I guess what I'm saying is that you'll grow out of this phase. Right now I have all the friends I could ever want, ironically at a phase I'm my life I want to be more solitary. reply",

So let’s invert it: what prevents/kills friendships? - lying (for whatever reason)\n- talking too much about yourself\n- not asking people about their lives\n- being too private\n- being too judgmental\n- not empathizing - e.g. someone tells you about something hard they’re experiencing and you change the subject\n- not caring to help (also showing you don’t care about others that aren’t in your friend-zone)\n- not offering help\n- not being kind\n- not smiling (more like makes it hard for people to approach you) Most of us want/need friends. Most of us want/need to talk to others about our lives. Someone just moved to where you live. They need a friend. They will strike a conversation w anyone. Even people in your past probably wanted to be your friend (either coz they thought you were cool or they just needed a friend) - you can still be friends with them. I’ve become friends w people I met long after meeting them. Asking someone how they are is not so much about the other person. It’s mostly a social ritual. But if no one is asking you how you are, they might also be intimidated by you. As Aaron Burr would say: talk less, smile more - jk, do more of both. reply",

Some of these social problems (e.g, ones caused by missing childhood socialization experiences) are curable through practice, but others will require you to learn enough about human social behavior to mask until someone figures out a cure. It can be exhausting, (just like physical exercise can be exhausting) but it's a useful skill to have in order to do well in life. Good luck. reply",

You can browse and ride at https://app.skidmarks.club . I’ve done ~10 rides with it so far. Hoping I can convince my wife to use it and save myself $50 a month. That would be my most successful side project by a wide margin. There are probably a lot of examples like this. Vibe coded software people made for themselves, and other people could use it if they wanted. All of the code was reviewed by myself, and I’m a programmer, so not sure if that fits the description. I didn’t go through it with a fine-toothed comb, however, and 90% of the review was on my phone. I also did some non-vibed setup for hosting, db, email, etcetera. To me vibe coding is not looking at any of the code at all, but the definition reads a little loose to me these days, especially on HN, as: did an LLM “type” most of the code or did you? Either way I don’t think the term or definition is a big deal and probably not worth splitting hairs over. reply",

          "text": "I’m using the peloton only. I bought a little iPad/phone mount that I put on the handlebars. I run the app on my iPad, put the peloton in “just ride” mode (no subscription needed) and match the cadence/resistance with the web app. When it comes to cycling I’m a complete novice which is why the workouts have resistance as % of total (what peloton does) and I recently added an option where you can switch to relevant effort in settings. I appreciate this comment because I didn't know what people typically did for creating their own workouts and recently learned about FTP. I'm going to look into this! There are several interesting projects around peloton hacking that have served as inspiration: - [0] Peloton android app side loader: https://github.com/doudar/Openpelo - [1] Overlays metrics on the Peloton: https://github.com/selalipop/grupetto - [2] Bookmarklet to overlay cadence/resistance on web classes (this is what I started with): https://gist.github.com/rocng/2ff577948569ce0764b8938687841b... - [3] Decodes Peloton metrics from the serial port: https://github.com/ihaque/pelomon - [4] Transform Peloton into a smart trainer: https://github.com/doudar/SmartSpin2k/ These can be used in combination to use your Peloton with Zwift. Groupetto and Pelomon are really interesting. I'd like to integrate with something like Groupetto and use OpenPelo to have the full experience on the Peloton itself. That's kind of the end game, but I think the web app is the most approachable and easiest to get started with -- at least for me. reply",

It’s complex software (state, auth, heavy logic), but it will never be on Product Hunt because it's purely for internal utility.\nThe success metric here isn't \"did we get 10k users,\" it's \"did we avoid a $50k contract and weeks of integration hell.\" reply",

I have a tiny tissue culturing lab in my home and wanted to manage media batches and their ingredients, cultures using the batches of media, inventory for media ingredients, and general inventory for running things. Cleaning, cutting, measuring, etc. I couldn't find anything which would allow me to keep stock of what I've got in the structure I needed, let alone while also project things like \"I've got enough inventory for n batches of y media\". And all of the half-measure inventory software was expensive as hell. I also built a solution for myself that was largely vibe coded. The underlying schema for inventories, batches, orders, cultures, etc was done in advance to help guide Claude along with documentation, but I'd guess 75 percent of the code is pure Claude. It has worked really well for a while now. Since it's just me using it and I'm able to roll with issues it causes or verify outputs on the fly if I want to, it's totally fine not being super polished. It meaningfully increases my productivity by allowing me to manage things in a way that fits my mental model and business. Like you, the cost of the project has been less than a subscription. And the subscriptions wouldn't even do what I needed. reply",

You typically take tissue from the part of the plant called the meristem, where cells are actively dividing and less likely to be infected, then rapidly disinfect and transfer the tissue to a sterile culture. It seems like it should be such a sophisticated and complex process, but all you're doing is cutting a chunk of fresh cells out and popping it into some goo where it can continue to grow. Extracting meristem tissue is usually the only difficult part. They can be extremely tiny. It takes a sharp eye and very steady hands. I've only done it for practice, never out of necessity. I'm pretty bad at it. It seems kind of like magic if you ignore the biologal machinery. It makes perfect sense why it works, yet it's also absolutely crazy that it does. reply",

Interest in DependencyDesk has come exclusively through showing it directly to industry contacts. The latter is partly what I was getting at regarding domain expertise because with that expertise comes an industry network. AI is great but if you’re creating solutions in search of a problem then the code doesn’t matter because nobody will need/want your product. I feel like your chances of success are much higher if you’ve personally felt the pain your product intends to solve, and that pain is built into the domain expertise people accrue over a long period of time. reply",

By submitting it to relevant directories, I managed to increase its DR noticeably. That process later turned into a second small product, listmy.site, where I help others get similar directory-based backlinks. https://listmy.site Both are fairly simple full-stack apps, but they’re in production, have real users, and generate revenue — mostly built with LLM help + iteration.

While this is more pleasent in real-life tactile space, not as much fun when using the computer to have to click-and-drag all the pieces around (of course, sorting them etc, is up to the user, but just some kind of initial \"see all the pieces in the space without them overlapping each other to the greatest extent possible depending on the total space avaliable given the current zoom settings\" ... reply",

To be honest the packaging part was probably the toughest bit and all the different ways each platform needs to build. - Probably my most \"successful\" one, at 450+ downloads on the Play store. https://formait.app/ - Free offline document formatting using LLMs to take a load of unstructured notes and give you a nice PDF output. You can load any GGUF model you throw at it as it's implementing llama.cpp, but uses Phi-4 out the box.

          "text": "Not sure this counts as \"successful\" yet (invite-only beta, still rough), but I'm building a full product almost entirely via LLM-assisted coding. Tangents ( https://tangents.chat ) is an Angular/Nest/Postgres app for thinking-with-LLMs without losing the thread. - Branch: select any span (user or assistant) and branch it into a tangent thread so the main thread stays coherent. - Collector: collect spans across messages/threads into curated context, then prompt with it. - You can inspect a \"what the model will see\" preview and keep a stored context-assembly manifest. Vibe-coding aspect: about 600 commits and about 120k LOC (tests included) and I have not handwritten the implementation code. I do write specs/docs/checklists and I run tests/CI like normal. What made it workable for something larger than a static page: - Treat the model like a junior dev: explicit requirements plus acceptance criteria, thin slices, one change at a time. - Keep \"project truth\" in versioned docs (design system plus interface spec) so the model does not drift. - Enforce guardrails: types, lint, tests, and a strict definition of \"done.\" - The bottleneck is not generating code, it is preventing context/spec drift and keeping invariants stable across hundreds of changes. If you define \"vibe coding\" as \"I never look at the code,\" I do not think serious production apps fit that. But if you define it as \"the LLM writes the code and you steer via specs/tests,\" it is possible to build something non-trivial. Happy to answer specifics if anyone cares (workflow, tooling, what breaks first, etc.). reply",

They're fairly simple things, but they get the job done in ways that did not exist for me before. And, again, I'm not a coder and only know the absolute basics of programming. This is not something I would have been able to do without AI assistance. There's also the fact that many programmers working on software today both big and small use AI to one degree or another, maybe not to program the whole thing from scratch, but definitely to help ease the process. It's an invaluable tool. reply",

The biggest untold story in aviation is the battle between the pilots of small \"regional aircraft\" vs \"mainline aircraft\",  the former of which generate less value for the same amount of work and necessarily get paid less.  Unions have enforced \"scope clauses\" that have prevented a new generation of slightly larger regional aircraft which could lower costs at small airports and have no trouble getting filled as those lower costs get passed on to consumers.  As it is small airports are dying out,  harming smaller cities and towns and giving the \"left behind\" all the more reason to lash out. Similarly there is a lot of a talk of crisis in truck driving,  both at the local and long-haul levels.  My brother-in-law has a CDL and he is always talking about how inexperienced drivers seem to wedge their trucks on a bridge in Binghamton once a month,  stall out on the highway and get into accidents, etc. reply",

For runway equipment (ie ILS), it probably changes enough that you couldn't \"just use ILS\" for takeoff.

Its 'fun' because i think i like to discuss but i have often than not the feeling i have to explain things While you mentioned LLMs: I do think that simplifing what LLMs are to a statistical parrot, shows how little people on hn know about LLMs, at least the ones commenting on it and repeating this every time.

You need to train yourself to scan and decide which discussions are worth going into and which aren’t. This applies to any kind of forum or group chat. If I’m happy? I see HN less as a place for joy and more as a place to know what’s going on. It’s still useful. There’s a lot of BS mixed in, and that’s just part of the deal. It’s not a defining part of my happiness or my life, almost like a newspaper. I just ignore the sloppy posts, be it AI or non-AI related. reply",

There's always going to be a prevailing zeitgeist, and that's always going to dominate people's focus. But by and large, HN is the most intelligent, thoughtful community I've encountered, with people going out of their way to be kind and thorough in their replies, discussing things maturely, disincentivizing unhelpful and low-effort behavior. Not to mention the dizzying wealth of knowledge and experience the people here have. Obviously it's not 100%. There are plenty of harsh people and attitudes. But there's a lot of good discussion happening here, and that's what I try to focus on. I can only hope one day to be as interesting/inspiring a member of the community as some of the people I've seen on here. reply",

There were a lot of similar other failure points I used to keep enumerated mentally, but now there's too many to count. The biggest ones are email access however.<p>Is there a process or method I can use to enumerate/track and fix those kids of failure points in my personal cybersecurity?</p></p></div>",

That's the only reason the VP of Engineering wanted to interview me. They didn't think I had a chance, but since I showed respect by taking the time to write my CV and cover letter myself, the least they could do was give me a chance. I didn't get the job, of course, but the VP sent me a P.S. He said he hoped we could collaborate in the future, and he appreciated the time I put into it. (At first I thought it was a template, but on second thought, I think he was sincere.) So my two bitcoins for you: be yourself, even if you’re a bit rough right now. You'll get better. People do notice the effort you put into how you present yourself or at least the people I think actually matter to work with and work for. reply",

          "text": "I don’t know you personally, but I think humility matters a lot. You mentioned that you’re “pretty smart,” and this may very well be true. I’m involved in interviewing at my work, and one thing I’ve learned is that raw intelligence alone isn’t what stands out most. I consider myself a hard worker, but realistically fairly mediocre in terms of pure skill or ability (and that’s okay, I’m doing fine). What matters more to me is that I’m always trying to learn and grow. I tend to find it offputting when candidates describe themselves as “experts” or “highly skilled” in technologies or languages. It’s possible to be an expert, but usually that comes with very narrow depth. These self-declared experts are often a red flag. I’ve been coding in C# for nearly 20 years and have been using AWS technologies for nearly a decade, and I still wouldn’t call myself an expert. I find it a bit amusing when self-declared experts cannot confidently explain the inner workings of the garbage collector or the CLR in great detail. There’s nothing wrong with not knowing those things, but declaring yourself an expert sets a high bar that often doesn’t hold up. Personally, I much prefer candidates who are humble, honest about their strengths and gaps, and clearly motivated to keep learning. reply",

But VLC is actually pretty good on Mobile (iOS/Andriod.) besides the pain of syncing files over to iOS. I splurged on a dedicated DAP (Digital Audio Player) last year that I'm mostly happy with: a HiBY R1 (my two complaints are: 1. for whatever reason it refuses to pair to my car's bluetooth, no issues pairing to numerous other devices. 2.

          "text": "I never switched away from listening to my own music collection, so my experience may not be useful to you. Here's the setup I have. I run Kodi as my music server at home, with a NAS that contains all of my music. My collection is quite large and continues to grow. I get most of my new music on CDs (usually purchased at the merch table at live performances) or through Bandcamp these days, although I'm open to any source that allows me to have unencumbered lossless recordings. This allows me to use Kodi's native front end when I'm listening on my home sound system, to use a web front end to play on any web-connected computer, and to stream from my server to my smartphone when I'm out and about. It's the best of all worlds. I have all the convenience of a streaming service, but I actually own the music and it will never become suddenly unavailable or replaced by inferior versions, and I don't have a fixed recurring cost just to enjoy music. Plus, a ton of great music is simply not available on any commercial streaming platform and this eliminates that issue. I don't tend to use MP3s, though. I go with FLAC instead. Kodi will transcode the FLACs to other formats if needed. reply",

Personally, my music taste (and the amount of tracks that I listen to) is way more varied now than it was before, but I suppose that depends both on how you use streaming services and how you use local MP3s. Back when I still used exclusively MP3s, I used Music on Console Player [0] on my personal computer and Snae Player [1] on my school's chromebook, since we were only allowed to use web apps on our Chromebooks. On my phone I found VLC [2] to be the best app since it has so many features. I can highly recommend both programs. I still have all three installed and use them whenever I don't have internet. Although I haven't updated my local music library in a while, so I am reminded of my old music tastes whenever I open either of them.

Much better than hauling a phone out and spend time navigating menus. Nobody ever says a word to me, unless I have the earbuds in; then complete strangers will walk up and start talking.

You install a client on the system you want to manage and enroll it with a single command, just like Tailscale. I’ve built a nice web application were users can manage and access their devices, setup monitoring and configure alerts (for now it only tracks basic stuff like CPU/RAM…) The whole thing uses WebRTC for p2p connections and it’s very snappy because all the graphics pipeline is fully custom (all the enconding/decoding is platform-specific too) and I’ve managed to get latency and quality on par with Parsec in many scenarios (I still have some work to do here because it’s not my thing) I plan on making the whole thing open source with a permissive license and also offer a paid SaaS early in 2026 (I think early February?). I plan on offering a hobby free tier and then paid business/pro features but time will tell! I haven’t event built a landing page yet but if you are interested write me to ramon@rigel.sh reply",

          "text": "After few years of work, I have launched https://gethly.com this year, so I will keep on working on it. It is a platform for content creators to sell their digital content or build paid membership communities. In essence it is a paywall. Main idea was to give creators a single place for selling digital content, so no need to put their e-books or music on other platforms, or to use third party chat and forum servers to run their community. They can sell access via membership or make one-time sales of digital content or access to hosted content, receive donations, etc... best part is that no one else is able to offer a minimum sale price of 1 cent, as no payment processors are involved. So no fees and minimum are imposed. Which incentivises users to make purchases. Albeit it is more about maintenance than adding some new features right now. I implemented almost all I wanted already. The only thing I would like to work on is support for live video streaming, as that involves video ingress, video encoding and video distribution. It is a solid piece of work to take a swing at. But it makes no financial sense at this time as video is the most expensive thing to tackle on the web. Hopefully next year I'll get more exposition with time and more customers to make it financially viable. As for other projects, I was thinking about making yet another reverse proxy, with a twist(which I won't reveal). That could make it something people would be willing to pay a few bucks for over the open sourced ones. I am not fully on board with it, as the time investment here will likely be at least half a year, so I am still just toying with the idea and whether to go ahead. And lastly, I am kinda thinking about making a game. My first. I am doing research and found out Go can totally handle it, which surprised me as I am a Gopher and really LOVE working with Go. Most games today are \"made\" in C#, which is also a language with GC and Go beats it in every aspect in performance. Plust next year, Go will have the new Greentea GC as default, so it will be even more performant. Knowing this made me excited about the idea of making a game without the need to learn a completely new language, ecosystem and rewire my brain to think differently(memory management and whatnot). I tried some things with Raylib already and that got me REALLY excited about the possibilities. I am not sure about the game just yet. So far I know I want it to be heavy storytelling game, not combat or strategy, as I am a good writer. Right now I am enticed either by victorian era setting or middle ages and the main purpose is to take the player on an adventure. reply",

          "text": "https://www.fenra.io/ AI costs are sneaky. In companies we’ve worked at, AI spend crept past $2k/month - not from one place, but scattered across different providers for text, images, audio, and video. Once that happens, it’s hard to tell what’s being used, by whom, and why costs are climbing. So we are building Fenra. Fenra is a simple tool for tracking AI costs, usage, and events across providers, surfacing patterns the way software teams actually want to see them. One place to understand what’s happening before the bill surprises you. We started about 15 days ago and already have our first pilot customer, with three other companies interested.

Each step gets explicit tool access and scoped permissions. That caught more bugs than heavier sandboxes and kept iteration fast. The biggest tradeoff in practice was safety vs debuggability.

          "text": "Funny you should mention this, I just added a simple filesystem sandbox to my coding agent. Check it out: https://github.com/jacobsparts/agentlib/blob/main/src/agentl... The framework is all python, but I used C for this helper.  It uses unprivileged user namespaces to mount an overlay and run an arbitrary command, then when the command finishes, it writes a tarball of edits, which I use to create a unified diff.  The framework orchestrates it all transparently, but the helper itself could be used standalone.  Here's a short document about the sandbox in the context of it's use in my project: https://github.com/jacobsparts/agentlib/blob/main/docs/sandb... I also have a version that uses SUID instead of unprivileged user namespaces, available by request. I often use claude code with --dangerously-skip-permissions but every once in a while it bites me.  I've learned to use git for everything and put instructions to always commit BEFORE writes in CLAUDE.md.  Claude can go off the rails on harder bug fixes, especially if there are multiple rounds of context compacting, it can really screw things up.  It usually honors guidance not to modify outside of the project, but a simple sandbox adds so much, after the session is over you can see what changed and decide what to do with it.  It really helps with the problem where it makes unexpected changes to the codebase, which you might not even notice otherwise, which can introduce serious bugs.  The permission models of all the coding agents are rough--either you can't get anything done, or you throw caution to the wind.  Full sandboxes are quite restrictive, which is why I rolled by own.  Honestly your best option right now is just to have good version control and run coding agents in dedicated environments. reply",

If you have an idea of your ICP, then cold outreach on LinkedIn specially if you are building and have people following you and commenting on your post. Don’t rely only in just the posts. \nI recently deleted every post on my linkedin with the goal of starting building in public and following this method which is the answer to your question. I belong to a paid community of very successful bootstrapped business developers and this is what the top members do, granted they are very successful and paid people to write their content which can be time consuming. reply",

There is a huge hurdle to produce good video content, it takes a lot of time to record, edit and publish quality videos.

Record in segments, with a full reset between each segment. Makes editing really fast. 3. Don't stress about small mistakes. People are into authenticity, it's ok. Lighting/\"studio\" design is still an art, but you can get something set up in a day or two. The harder part is coming up with good video ideas, and doing a compelling title/thumbnail/hook. That's a rabbit hole. If you have a social media following you can leverage that. Cold calls can work if you're selling big ticket items, but you also need to be good at sales and do a lot of legwork so I wouldn't go down that route. I wouldn't start advertising until you can demonstrate product market fit. reply",

Writing something that is commercially successful starts by identifying a potentially commercial product. In other words, you need to start by Marketing, not programming. You're looking for 3 things; A market you can reach;\nThat have money to spend;\nThat are prepared to spend money to make some pain go away. It might be obvious that a market might exist (say something that makes govt more effective) but selling to govt requires enormous resources you don't have. It might be obvious a market exists (a tool for refugees to apply for aid) but they have no money to buy anything from you. It might be obvious a market exists (trips to the moon) but you can't build that. Once you have found a market you can reach, who have some money, and are willing to spend (perhaps with a deposit) then (and only then) should you start coding.

What I’ve been trying recently is to treat “visibility” as a side effect of building, not a separate activity. A few things that seem at least directionally helpful for me: • Sharing my work-in-progress on social platforms — not launches, but the actual process: what I’m building, problems I hit, and how I solved them. This feels more like documenting than promoting. • Writing about concrete technical or product decisions I made, especially when I had to compare different approaches or tools. Those posts sometimes get picked up organically because they’re useful on their own. • Analyzing competitors carefully, then selectively submitting my product to directories or communities where similar tools already exist. I avoid mass submission and try to match the audience instead. None of this has “worked” in a big way yet, but it feels sustainable and doesn’t get me blocked or downvoted. For me, that’s already a win. reply",

Give them a short demo, a clear value story, and a unique link so they can track referrals. A single well‑matched micro-influencer can easily get you your first 100 real users.

But nobody really uses local LLMs long term. They say, \"Well, it's so great. Local LLMs work on small devices they even work on your mobile phone.\"<p>I have to say there's one exception for me and that's Whisper. I actually do use Whisper a lot. But I just don't use local LLMs. They're just really, really bad compared to cloud GPUs.<p>And I don't know why, because for me it seems that having a speech-to-text model is much more challenging to create than just a model that creates text.<p>But it seems that they really cannot remove the differences and have it run on consumer computers.

          "text": "Similar experience w/ my daughter (now 12 y/o) here. We read the heck out of children's books when she was little. There were nights when I really didn't want to slog thru the same Suzy Spafford[6] book again, but I did it anyway. I think it paid off. My daughter is an avid reader now. She says she still wants me to read to her, so I do. This year was a bit sci-fi heavy, and we've decided to target more fantasy and literature in 2026. This year's books included: \"Below the Root\", \"And All Between\", and \"Until the Celebration\" - The \"Green Sky Trilogy\"[0] by Zilpha Keatly Snyder. We held off on playing the \"Below the Root\" video game[1] but I'm hoping that as we get into winter weather and outside time becomes more scarce we can get to it. It's arguably the final book in the \"trilogy\". \"Redshirts\"[2] by John Scalzi. We've been slowly making our way through Star Trek TOS in the last couple years so. That gave her enough cultural fluency with the tropes in the book to make it effective. \"To Say Nothing of the Dog\"[3] by Connie Willis. My daughter adores Victorian England and comedy. This book also turned her on to Jerome K. Jerome's \"Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog)\"[4] (which I'm still working thru on my own-- I do not particularly love Victorian England but it is a good book). Besides the books I read to my daughter, I also read Martha Wells' \"The Murderbot Diaries\"[5] series myself. I'm vaguely interested in the television adaptation. I'd love to hear what somebody who has read the series thinks of the TV version.

It felt like it was made for fans (the portrayal of the embedded show, Sanctuary Moon, was wonderful and I felt like whoever did their hairstyles had an immense amount of fun), yet accessible without knowing the story. Murderbot’s self-narration was good; I wanted more since it drove so much of the book but what was there in the show carried its personality well. Alexander Skarsgard pulled the character off well. My mental picture of Murderbot from the books was very different but now when I re-read the first book after watching the show, I heard his voice. I still feel slightly sad they didn’t get a more genderless or gender-ambivalent actor (he looks male, the bot was agender before the show) or tried to portray him differently… they could have reduced this but the way they filmed him assigns gender to an ungendered character. The other actors were all excellent too. I felt far more of a sense of them as a team and individuals than I remember from the first book. If you enjoyed the books I think you’ll enjoy the show, except for me that it has changed my picture of Murderbot and I am not sure for the better, in terms of what I felt were social / identity values the books encouraged. reply",

          "text": "Thanks for the analysis. I've been reading it with a thought toward how I might've adapted it for video. The narration seemed incredibly challenging (and kept making me think of \"A Christmas Story\", of all things). The integration of \"Sanctuary Moon\" sounds particularly fun. I definitely see Murderbot as genderless and seeing it as gendered is going to be weird. Fortunately, the series isn't particularly \"dear\" to me and I think I can deal with the trauma of having my mental pictures wiped-out by somebody else's. (There are properties like \"Neuromancer\" and \"Snow Crash\" that I hope are never adapted to video and, if they are, I will steadfastly refuse to ever see, because I can't imagine anybody else's mental pictures will be better than mine...) reply",

Not that it's someone else's vision (for me), just that it would be Netflix/Hollywood Cyber Slash Noir. I can't imagine anything worse than them looking like every other set-in-the-future adaptation. I've never seen \"A Christmas Story\" (Wikipedia shows it as very American-cultural-icon) but reading the synopsis, I'm surprised how many parts of it are semi-familiar, perhaps culturally reflected in other ways.

          "text": "Technical followed by non-technical. I read more than these, but these are the highlights. Mouse, a Language for Microcomputers by Peter Grogono - Mouse is basically an esolang with barely any abstraction facilities, but the book was well-written and the language compelling enough to explore further. Notes on Distance Dialing (pdf) by AT&T - Described the telephone systems of the USA and Canada in the mid-1950s. The reading is a dry as it gets, but it was a fascinating dive into a vastly complex system solving extremely hard problems. This is a must-read for folks interested in systems-thinking. That said, I am actively looking for recommendations for books about the process of designing and building the unbelievably complex telephony system over the rudiments of the earlier systems. Recommendations welcomed! The Eye of Osiris by R. Austin Freeman - This is the first book that I’ve read from Freeman and I suspect that I will read many more in the future. The story follows the disappearance of John Bellingham, Egyptologist and the subsequent investigation. As the investigation stalls, the eminent Dr. Thorndyke digs into the case. The story sets up the mystery nicely and indeed provides enough information to the reader to infer how the disappearance occurred and who or what facilitated it. The book is one of the best whodunits that I’ve ever read. The Mystery of Edwin Drood by Charles Dickens - His final work remains unfinished as he passed away before he could complete it. Further complicating the meta-story is that he also didn’t outline the ending nor even put to paper the “villain” of the story. The meta-mystery of the ending has motivated a mountain of speculation around the ending including dozens of continuations of the story from other authors, all deriving their pet endings from textual hints, accounts from Dickens’ friends, illustration notes, and even in some cases seances supposedly accompanied by the spirit of Dickens himself. What was written by Dickens is spectacular and a compelling mystery and although it would be great to know the resolution, in some ways the “Droodiana” that has cropped up over the past 150+ years is reason enough for it to remain a mystery. The whole lore around Edwin Drood is a worthwhile hobby in itself and well-worth exploring. The Chiltern Library edition of the book contains the story and a good bit of the lore around the writing and the meta-works available at the time of its publication. The Shadow People by Margaret St. Clair - Sadly out of print and difficult to find, but I’ve had it on my shelves for decades and finally got around to reading it. The book came onto my radar in the 1980s when I learned about it in the appendix-n of the 1st edition Advanced D&D Dungeon Masters Guide. I enjoyed many of the books at the time and have slowly swung around to re-reading them over the past few years. Sadly, most on the list do not stand the test of time for me, but St. Clair’s mixture of 60s counter-cultural leanings in a fantasy/sf world still works. The cultural touch-points in the book feel quite dated, but despite the occasional awkwardness, the story is unique even today. Lolly Willowes by Sylvia Townsend Warner - The book started as a passable novel of manners focused on a turn of the century British middle-class family. The titular character was mostly background decoration for the first third of the novel and AFAIR was talked about only in the third-person. It’s only when she made the choice to move out on her own to the country in her middle age does she gain a central role in the narrative and her inner thoughts revealed. This is where things really pick up because I was shocked to learn that this unassuming woman’s inner thoughts had a delicious darkness to them. I don’t want to give away too much, but I’ll just say that you will not expect how the story ends. Patience by Daniel Clowes - A profound graphic novel using time-travel to explore the idea of enduring love with a story that proceed through time, following Jack as he tries to alter the past and save the woman he loves. This well-known science fiction motif is elevated by Clowes’ signature psychological complexity. Narcissus and Goldmund by Herman Hesse - I’ve read most of the books by Hermann Hesse but this one escaped my attention until this year. The story follows the parallel lives of a monk Narcissus and his passionate friend Goldmund as they respectively search for meaning in life through spiritual means and through pleasures of the flesh. We Who Are About To… by Joanna Russ - A small group of astronauts crash land on a hostile alien world and quickly realize that rescue is unlikely to come. Many SF stories have started this way and so the expectation is that this is a colonization story… but Russ thrives on subverting reader expectations. Fifty Forgotten Records by R.B. Russell - Another lovely entry in Russell’s series (one can hope) of autobiographical explorations of art, so far covering literature and now music. This book describes 50 records of varying popularity and Russell’s personal connections to each. While I certainly enjoyed finding a dozen or so new albums to explore, the true triumph of the book lies in the vulnerable, reflective memoir threaded throughout. The Way of All Flesh by Samuel Butler A novel that follows 4-generations of the Ponitifex family, with a particular bildungsroman-esque thread around Ernest, a young man who’s naivete leads to his downfall and how his life unfolds thereafter. I wrote about these (and more) at https://blog.fogus.me/2025/12/23/the-best-things-and-stuff-o... reply",

          "text": "Sci-fi nerd recommendations follow. I binged the entirety of the Dungeon Crawler Carl series. The cover, & the fact that it was on Kindle Unlimited, made me think it was probably cheap crap, but I was impressed with how well-written it was, and how much I empathized with the characters. (I probably should have read it slower; by the last two books, I was just flowing with the text, not paying as much attention to the overarching plot.) Heinlein's \"Orphans of the Sky\" was pretty bad. So much early scifi is considered great because it's groundbreaking, writing about things nobody else has before. The concept of a generation ship was pretty new at the time Heinlein was writing it, and it has some very interesting concepts, but the book has some really bad problems . If you've read it, you know; if you haven't, and decide to, you'll see it for yourself. I binged a few Brandon Sanderson books. The standalones are great; the Stormlight Archive is a huge slog through some beautiful writing, but I'm not sure I'm willing to spend so much time in beautiful books that move the plot forward so slowly. Exordia, by Seth Dickinson, started off incredible, kept going, but the ending felt like both a fizzle as well as a cliff-hanger for the next book. I'm glad I read it, but I wish it had a clear conclusion it wanted to reach. Adrian Tchaikovsky's \"Children of Memory\" delivers more of the great philosophical questions & answers about the nature of consciousness and personhood that the previous books did, A+. No idea where he could possibly go from there, but if he does, I'm going along for the journey. (Honorable mention: Alien Clay. Dishonorable mention: Service Model.) Eric Flint's \"Fenrir\" was a fun BDO near-future space adventure. (As was John Sanford's Saturn Run, but that wasn't a 2025 book I read.) reply",

You can now read lots of those stories on-line (like at https://www.freesfonline.net/Magazines2.html ).  Some of them have stood the test of time, but some are really really bad.  John Campbell, the editor of Analog back then, was racist, and also convinced that smoking tobacco was a Good Thing.  Many of the stories were written (by others) to convey those ideas; it's almost unusual for lead characters not to light up a cigarette. It will be interesting to see how much of today's scifi holds up half a century from now---not because the science is wrong, but because the moral qualities will be judged outlandish. reply",

If you're getting/have a newborn, this is the book I'd read. It's humane. No sleep training, no nonsense about babies. We went full ‘possum’ with our baby and I like how happy he became. I've also read Ten Things I Wish You Knew About Your Child's Mental Health. To me this could be an instant classic. No fluff, lots of advice for parents. Prima. There's plenty of literature on parenting, but so much of it is poorly written or poorly researched. Be careful out there. (And don't read PLS, yikes.) --- I finally discovered Andy Weir, the Thursday Next series, and The 13.5 Lives of Captain Bluebear. I'm amazed it took me so long to get there. All excellent. For some reason I decided to read all 7 Harry Potters in French. If you're learning French, it's a great idea, the French gets progressively harder so you can keep up! Bryson's At Home: A Short History of Private Life has been my companion for some weeks, but it's quite long. I'm happy with all my reading this year, some 32 books, many in a foreign language. Given I've no time to read during the day, and can only get some pages in after the kid's in bed, it's not too shabby. Oh, and we've read Stompysaurus, like, 90 times? Grawwwwr!

A bit like working out at the gym. The other surprise is that once you start reading, you get really quick. Like, surprisingly fast. After a while you notice the words are going by faster. So the effort compounds. When you start you think “my god that took 5 hours of boring reading time to get though” and by book 10 you think “that was 2.5 hours and I learnt a lot and my brain is happy.” reply",

A fiction story about how personal computers have dismantled society over 40 years... it takes place in 1983 and involves a vulnerable opportunistic time traveler who's getting more than he bargained for. Here's some quotes to give you a feel: \"The smartphone is the electrical stunner in the slaughterhouse of society\" \"You’ll be able to access any TV or radio station in real time, around the world, talk to people overseas in high resolution video with live translations for free and be bored by it\" \"In the future the hermetic spaces of solitude will be breached as we build a global village. The private will become public and, ironically, the public will become private as the streets empty of experiences taken indoors, inside of bedrooms, beneath our screens of glowing grace.\" It's intentionally meant to be ambitious, brutal and challenging.

Kindle app syncs between devices, and makes it easier to read a few pages here and there instead of waiting for uninterrupted sessions with my Kindle. 3. Continually updating a To Read list, mostly by going to Barnes and Noble, taking pictures of featured book tables, then adding the interesting ones to my Libby hold list. 4.

          "text": "My top book of the year: Fryderyk Chopin: A Life and Times , Alan Walker A riveting read by a legendary musicologist and biographer.  Walker spent about ten years researching this.  It is 700 pages, which seems daunting but he makes this authoritative bio absolutely enjoyable.  It's also a \"corrective biography\", it dispels a lot of myths.  This book is one of the best examples of accessible writing with flair.  What a writer! Throughout the book, Walker tastefully quotes musical phrases (in notation) from Chopin's works to situate them in context.  I often paused reading and put on the track on a given page (nocturnes, mazurkas, preludes, etc).  It made the reading experience incredibly rich and fun.  Other things I enjoyed: Chopin's letters to his friends and family, life in aristocratic salons of Paris, London, Warsaw, and more—Chopin had unparalleled access.  Of course, there's also a lot of gut-wrenching stuff.  As the book's blurb says, it really is for both the casual music lover and the professional pianist. If you haven't discovered them yet, give a listen to Chopin's nocturnes.  But please, give them an attentive listen and play them on a high-quality audio system.  Here[1] is one of his finest nocturnes (it is less famous than the \"happier\" nocturne that follows it, Op. 9 No. 2).

          "text": "When I was a kid, I was really into fantasy books and online text-based RPGs. I met some friends through one of those games, and they needed some changes made to their website and forum. Somehow, I ended up working on it. Then I asked my parents to get me a PHP5 book for Christmas. I think I was around 13-14 then. This was one of few programming books I've read thoroughly, although I don't remember anything from it now. After that I started creating websites, learning HTML and JavaScript. At some point I've found Clojure and functional programming and, immediately, decided it's better than anything else, so I started to learn it.\nMostly, I learned by trying to make something, looking through the internet to find help, and joining some online communities. My parents didn't care much if I was focused on school or not, as long as I was doing something, so I had a lot of time to learn by myself. In high school programming was one of the leading subjects in my class. There I realized I'm already quite proficient at it. I was not the best in math or physics, but was easily the best in programming. And so it goes on for about 20 years now. I still mostly learn by doing. I read some programming books, but rarely as thoroughly as my first PHP book. reply",

          "text": "Started by reading lots of articles on Topcoder (they have a dynamic programming tutorial which imo is the best material on DP). Then did exercises from CLRS before writing a single line of code. I considered it leg work and not of very high value (remains true though, the best paying jobs in tech are research and in finance its quant trading). Then I dived head first into C++ and Java, slogged through the pain and I got absolutely hooked. I learnt almost all of the computer science I know through books, good old fashioned working through exercises, doing lectures on MIT Ocw. Never paid a single cent for any professional courses or bootcamps or any of that jazz. I did write some Python in high school but most of the work I did while at uni studying something else entirely. My initial objective was not to build anything at all but to just get better at competitive coding. But then I built something reasonably complicated and I have been an engineer ever since. I have worked in ML, distributed systems, low level systems programming in the past 10years. To answer the question I learnt coding by self study. reply",

From there on I was always learning faster and more at home as a hobby, I was mostly ahead in school. A friend and classmate and I coded so many different projects during that time (2D terminal game, PHP forum, PHP CMS that was actually productive for a few years, thereby also learning how the internet worked).

I didn't know how arrays or linking/including worked (or that they existed), so it was one long file with each creature having its own function to determine their behaviour and their own health_creature_1, health_creature_2 and so on. I really started wondering if there was a better way after a while. reply",

          "text": "By solving problems in my life. When I was in high school, I needed to automate downloading torrents (I was downloading tons). So I plugged together a bunch of tools including: 1. QBittorrent to run a FileBot script once the file was finished downloading. 2. FileBot script was a Groovy script that renamed and rearranged the contents into proper folders and 3. A small Python script that called the Telegram API to send me a notification that the download was complete. Then I got into college and learnt they had a web portal which showed metrics like attendance (which turned out to be important) and test scores. So I wrote a Telegram Bot that would scrape these figures and save it into a database and run some calculations such as 1. Tell me how many lectures I needed to sit through to get to a required threshold. 2. If I decided to bunk college on certain days, how much attendance I'd end up losing. Then I opened up this bot to allow my friends to register. Near the end of the first semester, the test scores were only available on the website but there was no direct link to that page from the public portal. I had found it out playing around on it and noticed they had directory listing enabled on some endpoints which led me to those \"unlinked\" but functional pages. I wrote a neat feature which would allow querying this page and send a screenshot of it via my bot. I was running this entire thing on a Raspberry Pi 3B at my home and one morning I woke up to see logs from students I didn't know trying to use the bot (and ended up crashing it haha). Word had gotten around that test scores are accessible only through my bot. It was one of the best projects I ever worked on. At its peak, I had 300 DAUs and I would hear from my friends in other departments that their entire batch is using Telegram solely for my program. I was also able to monetize it towards the end which felt nice. These projects served as a learning tool for a lot of stuff for me. I learnt how to manage VMs, containerization, async I/O, DB and ORM integration, how to write good docs. I still miss it. reply",

Then you could type in the code of those games and play or modify them, as a lot of them were commented codes. The amazing part was the reader comment section in the end, where people were writing letters to the magazine publishers with their modifications to programs from one of the magazines before, so patches were literally transmitted via paper. To me as a child, I never understood that this was programming. This was just how I could play games on the device. Amazing memories with the C64, and I was so lucky to get one as a child because it was more common in the human generations before me.

After college I wrote lots of JavaScript targeting Web APIs and DOMs and strange frameworks. Still confused. We were serving on the order of 100,000,000 people a day, kind of just made it up as I went along. Now I write Elixir, and still only have a fuzzy idea of what I'm doing, but eventually it starts to work with the features and reliability I want.

          "text": "I played computer games as a kid and got interested in computers.  I looked at books from the library on how to make games.  This was in the 90s and many of the library books were from the 70s or early 80s.  Many of them focused on computers like the TRS-80 that I had never heard of.  Eventually at the library I found the David Ahl books (\"BASIC Computer Games\" and \"More BASIC Computer Games\"), and discovered that I had QBasic available in DOS.  I started typing in the listings and playing the games.  Pursuing this interest led me to get a fat book called \"Using BASIC\" that focused on QBasic. I started learning to modify the games I was inputting, and then to write my own simple games.  Somewhere in there I also was learning to write DOS batch files to do simple tasks.  I wrote a DOS menu system that let you choose which program you wanted to run, to make it easy for me or my siblings to run any of various games, plus \"serious\" programs like WordPerfect.  My dad got me a subscription to Dr. Dobb's Journal and a magazine called DOS World.  They had program listings in assembly that I also typed in and tried to modify, just doing super simple stuff like playing the Twilight Zone theme song on the PC Speaker.  A bit later I got into text adventures and wrote a few of those using special-purpose languages.  I also wrote some games in ZZT.  (And oh yeah, another comment on here reminded me I wrote some silly \"games\" in the variant of basic on my TI calculator, stuff like a Mad Libs generator.) At some point in high school I started using Python.  I think it was Python 2.1.  By that point the internet had gotten to the point where I could learn a lot by searching for stuff, and so then I kind of shifted into using web tutorials and newsgroups and forums and stuff, which continued until today.  Along the way I played around with a few other languages, like Haskell, and got reasonably conversant with JavaScript, but Python remains \"the\" language for me. So I was self-taught, at first relying on books and later on whatever I could scrounge from the internet.  I've never taken an actual class in programming or computer science. Games were a major factor in my early programming development, the other main line being small DOS utilities.  The David Ahl books were foundational for me, and I really hope people starting out today can find something like that, something that makes them go \"Wow, look at all the things that I can actually do just by taking this code that I don't understand and learning how to mess with it.\"  The \"Using BASIC\" book was similarly key in that it got me to understand how a programming language had a syntax, data types, and so on.  Even when I moved away from BASIC, I pretty easily understood how when I was reading a tutorial on Haskell or Python, it was in some sense telling me the same stuff that that book was telling me, although the languages were quite different. Since then I've taught programming a few times and I'm very informed by that early experience, basically the idea that learning to program involves just jumping in and wrestling with stuff, exploring and experimenting. reply",

This is probably taken a very heavy toll on my mental health but that’s another story. I’ve never been able to make friends and keep meaningful connections that last a long time. In fact I’d go as far as saying I have never had a friend, and I currently don’t have any. My phone is empty, when I go to school nobody talks to me and when I do find people who seem to have some kind of interest in me, it usually doesn’t last very long since they don’t prioritize whatever we have. As far as I’m aware I am tolerable to be around. People find me funny and when I do talk to people we have decent conversations (though small talk tends to bore me). However that doesn’t lead anywhere and doesn’t bring me any kind of comfort or fulfillment. I’ve attributed my lack of friends to something that places all the blame on me. Maybe I’m ugly, maybe I’m not funny enough, maybe I’m dumb. I don’t know if that’s the right approach. But I’ve tried so many different things, I’ve read so many different books and yet I still can’t get anyone to even bother to ask me how my day was or care to actually do something and hang out with me when I ask if they’d like too.<p>What am I supposed to do? Be lonely and without any kind of company and human connection my entire life?</p></div>",

The more needy you are and craving for attention the more unattractive and uninteresting you look as a person. The only solution for these types of problems (aside of usual phychotherapy/physiology that you need to rule out first with help of professionals!) - is to genuinely stop giving a single damn whether you're alone or not. Right after that moment you will become much much more attractive as a person. And you will release a ton of energy to focus on things that are more important (like your life goals etc). But you can't fool yourself and pretend that you don't care while still being worried about the outcomes inside. It's not \"fake it till you make it\" type of inner game. That is a key to your problem (after you solved main mommy/daddy issues if any with a decent therapist). No amount of shallow \"be yourself, be interested in others\" advice will help until you have a foundation to be congruent in these tactical actions. But if you have that foundation that type of advice is mostly redundant. reply",

Look in their eyes when they are talking to you and when you are talking to them. Completely put the notion of you needing or lacking friends in the backseat and put an interest and genuine caring about the lives of random people you meet in the front. You can't go into this with the goal of gaining something. Go in with the goal of giving of yourself -- your time, attention and interest.

          "text": "A lot of advice of what you should do, putting the burden on action which is likely to worsen your depression and self-worth image. So let me offer an alternative, healthier way of dealing with discomfort, especially of the soul: the first step is accepting the situation and making the best of it. Issues of loneliness aren't easily solved by joining the church or the cricket club, despite many comments along those lines; it's good to realise that loneliness sticks with us and gets more painful when around people. You won't ever feel so lonely as in a crowd. There is a difference between loneliness and solitude. Learn solitude. Learn to be comfortable with yourself. Know yourself, and chances are, you don't have a clue about yourself at 19, and you probably won't be for a few more decades of self-reflection, so get started. Then, when you'll find comfort in yourself, comfort in being by yourself, joy even, you'll be ready to face that door that is the cause of your great sadness today. And you'll come from a place where companionship is no more a matter of life-and-death, but from a more mature position that understand that people come and go, might love you and might hurt you, but the only constant source of joy, respite and calm lies within you, and it's been there all along. I'm not sure any of this would've made any sense to my 19 years old self, but no one sat down to explain this to me either, so I hope it strikes a chord. Just don't blame yourself for an ill society where connection is ever harder. -- a fellow lonely person that found joy in solitude, appreciating those heartfelt, fleeting moments with worthy humans. reply",

Climbers need climber friends (if only for the selfish need of a belayer). Its great to share notes on a climb, or chat about gear, or dream/plan good outdoors trips. Not suggesting you take up climbing. I'm using it as an example. But you want some hobby you're gonna take seriously that has a social component. And, stop being so hard on yourself.

Instead of waiting for others to reach out to you, for example, you might instead approach them. Be okay with the fear of rejection. When we are kids we make friends so easily because we haven’t yet learned to protect ourselves from rejection.

          "text": "+1e9, should be the top answer IMO. Activities create a group of people with a common interest, meeting regularly. You have a ready supply of people with something in common, you meet them regularly enough to create a bond, and easy ways to engage with them outside of class (\"hey people who attend activity X, shall we do some activity X outside of classes?\"). If you're not very sporty, less sporty things include: - photography - dancing classes (esp if you're a man, IME they are usually in short supply for classes) - hiking / walking groups - book clubs / chess / bridge - quirky sports like roller skating Otherwise, what other say. Other people like being listened to (and their interlocutor remembering what you said to them), that's an accessible trick to bond with people. And finally, it sounds like you don't struggle to build acquaintances - so maybe the tricky bit is \"converting\" them into friendships. I'd say, in case it makes you feel better, that this is very much the common experience, to varying degrees, and the cult of people having lots and lots of friends is, for most, commercial propaganda. reply",

          "text": "Most people are not the ones initiating a hangout with others who they aren't yet friends with, they usually join in when invited if it fits their schedule/they are bored, etc. I'd recommend trying to brush off a bit the feeling of rejection since you don't have these connections yet. It sucks a bit but knowing it's completely normal might help you not feel it's something personal against you. My recommendation is to keep trying with the ones you felt you could potentially click, I also have ADHD but never had much of an issue to make friends, and never made it a \"goal\", I just kept getting interested in people and would try to meet them again, most times it fizzles out even though you can have a nice time together but eventually some people stick around and become friends over time :) Also try to have a well defined event, and be genuine, do things you like and try to invite people you met with these shared interests, in a casual and friendly way, people are more prone to join in when they don't feel there's pressure to do it. I think the 3 first points of this comment [0] touch very much on the core of it, if you can strengthen against the feeling of rejection, and learn to be open and vulnerable (while balancing it to not become oversharing) it can go a long way to make people see and connect with you. Almost everyone is \"in the closet\" somehow, putting up a mask, when people meet someone that shows less of a mask and more themselves they usually will find those interesting.

          "text": "If I may be so bold, the fallacy here is of time. Dare I say, you are already surrounded by friends, and not noticing it. It seems like you measure \"friendship\" not by the time spent with them when you go to events or in school, but what happens afterwards. In other words, you are discounting to zero the moments that are actually happening in your life, for an imagined future of what a friendship might turn out to be. But life only ever happens moment to moment. That time that you spend with people at an event, that IS the thing. There is no \"friendship certificate\": some people, you'll only spend ten minutes with; some, you might spend an afternoon with; others you might end up seeing once a week for a term. You might date a girl for a fortnight, or a couple of months, and then break up and never see each other again. It's ALL GOOD. If I understand correctly, none of the above would qualify in your eyes as \"real friendship\", only the deep, deep kind. You might find it helpful to learn about Dunbar's number, and the size of the model's concentric social circles. Most people end up with 1-2 very close friends (possibly including their spouse). That is the outcome over a lifetime of making connections. Popular culture markets this idea that we should all be carousing with a tightly knit group of friends - no statistical social evidence bears this out. When sinking into deep analysis about all your self-perceived inadequacies, your attention beam is directed inwards. That's unhealthy. When it's directed OUT, into the world, it takes you out of your head, and lets you see that everyone, every single one (person or otherwise), is struggling in their own way. Everyone's got a thing. Looking out builds empathy and kindness and affection towards things that make you happy, and gazing inwards makes you miserable. You are surrounded by people in school, and are at a stage in life where you get to be interested in whatever. Any experience you have, even if it doesn't lead to lifelong friendships, is worthy in the space of time it occupies. Throughout my undergrad I had friends come and go. I'm not in touch with anyone I met at Uni during those years.  It doesn't make the actual time spent with these people any less special. reply",

          "text": "After a life with no friends, I found meaning and purpose in my faith, which helped me grow out of my antisocial behaviors.  Joining a faith community at the start of my college years gave me a safe space to interact as I matured, and that changed my life. My childhood was a life of constant transition.  Despite my outgoing personality, we moved often, so I had few acquaintances and no lasting friends.  Critically, I rarely saw my father, a socially, athletically, intellectually, financially successful man whose affirmation and guidance I would have benefitted from.  With no friends and no dad I was adrift. In my teens I began to idealize romantic companionship, but my emotional neediness drove away anyone I was interested in.  This feedback loop (loneliness causing antisocial behavior, reinforcing loneliness) needed to be broken. The turn around in my life was  coming to faith in Jesus in college.  I started consistently attending a campus Bible study, and made several lifelong friends, and many more positive relationships.  With an active, relationship oriented community, I no longer craved romantic validation, so my disposition to women gradually shifted from neediness to cordially but confidently focusing on other things.  It took a few years for this dynamic to mature in me, but by the time I was a college senior, several women around me started expressing interest in me — something I’d never experienced before.  A couple of them were not my type, but one in particular turned out to be a generous, agreeable woman with a kind family, who was also quite gorgeous, someone my younger self never could have attracted.  I married her, and now I get to be the father that I never had to our children. Reading your post reminds me of the ache I felt as a young man.  But I think that if you find your purpose, you can find your people.  And while you never fully “arrive” there is a peace you get just from journeying in the right direction. reply",

          "text": "Hi yresting, I hear you, but I don't think this is the best place to be looking for wisdom in this area - this community is somewhat well known for being head down in work. I see some straight up bad advice being given in here (being obsessed with finding relationships, which is human need does not perpetuate the problem, it is a biological drive to solve it) And some good advice: Be genuinely curious about others. Really listen to them. Look in their eyes when they are talking to you and when you are talking to them. (This has done wonders for me in trying to build community!) For me personally, being christian has helped a little (church ends up being a source of community). Is there any spiritual or religious practice you could find a place of worship to be around others who share your belief with? I'm not trying to impose my faith, but rather my practice of being around those who share my core beliefs. Another thing that really really helped me was getting over my preoccupation with older friends. My closest friend is 30 years older than me. Literally my dad's age. He is a consistent and reliable guy, and despite having somewhat different backgrounds, he's given mid-30s me a LOT of wisdom and encouragement. reply",

Be genuine and don’t fake yourself. Don’t try to behave in a way you think might impress someone, and don’t force yourself in trying to become someone else to become friends with someone.\n(Take this as a fundamental advice and I will reference it) 2. Put yourself out there. Try to be more of an extrovert. Approach people for help, If you wanna talk to someone, just talk. (And take advice 1 here, don’t fake yourself). 3. Look, there are definitely people out there who are your type and you’d be great friends. It’s just you have to keep putting yourself out there until you ‘find’ or ‘attract’ the right kind of people.\nParticipate in events, be a part of communities. It won’t happen if you consciously try. Don’t be on a lookout, just try to express yourself and take all opportunities to socialise. reply",

Turn yourself into a billboard, wearing T-shirts for things you like (bands, geeky things, etc). A \"cool shirt\" comment can start a conversation. Start smoking. Ok, don't do that.

Terrible idea, but it did help me meet some people that almost 30 years later I still consider friends. > What am I supposed to do? Be lonely and without any kind of company and human connection my entire life? You won't be. I'm 48 now, and while I'm somewhat well adjusted, when I was your age, and even a bit older, I was such an introverted outcast. Still am, I just learned how to communicate better over time and more or less relate to people where they are, even if we are different. We all grow at different rates. That doesn't help your sense of loneliness today, but as you discover yourself and who your \"tribe\" is, those connections will form and grow, even if it seems impossible today. reply",

Group therapy can also help, and it can improve your listening and empathy. Aside from that, I’d evaluate your behavior, personally I’ve always struggled with food addiction and often used that as a crutch to deal with loneliness. Be honest with yourself and check your coping mechanisms- playing video games, doomscrolling, alcohol, etc.. It’s easy to think of these things as relatively harmless ways to blow off steam, but over relying on them can change how you interact with the world, and thus how you’re perceived by others. As for more practical suggestions, if you’re into listening to music, see if any of the local venues have shows you’d be interested in. Finding people who are passionate about the same music you are is a great shortcut to finding potential friends. reply",

If you're too clammed up, people recognize that and keep a certain distance. It could also be that you have a very rigid personality. It might simply be a matter of lack of socialization. I don't think there is any way to diagnose this and pinpoint the problem. Learning how to be social is very much a lot like learning how to program: try lots of things, spend a lot of time doing it, and don't be afraid of breaking things. Eventually you'll develop your own methods to keep people entertained and then people will take more interest in you. Been there, done that.

Judging from these descriptions: > I’m socially anxious and keep to myself > small talk tends to bore me > it’s exhausting always having to text them to hang out, if I don’t then we never talk again It's highly possible that you have undiagnosed autism spectrum disorder. I say this because I am reading a book right now about ASD[0] and a lot of this is ringing true, especially the part about being confused why friends are dropping you. Speak to a psychologist and see what they think (or read the book first, and then speak to them). I am 30 now and am just cluing in that I might be on the spectrum, and oh boy do I wish I had caught it when I was younger. (It's also possible that you don't have ASD but some other condition like avoidant personality disorder, but whatever it is, it is so much easier to solve it once you've figured it out.)

I was badly bullied at school and felt worthless and didn't have the confidence at that time to make friends, though I couldn't see it, but I really wanted to, I just didn't know how. At the time I was lonely and depressed. I joined the military just before I was your age and had buddies until I left and it was the military that sorted me out. With the benefit of age and lack of hormones I've come to accept that I have no friends for reasons. It doesn't bother me anymore.

A really unusual person is going to be way out on the fringes, without many nearby points, and finding those points - the people who get them - is going to take time. If you're one of those people then it's going to suck, especially in the beginning. But as time passes and you start to accumulate those rare relationships where things feel like they click, you'll probably be glad of it. The people you find will almost invariably be interesting weirdos, and enriching to be around in a way that people from the centre tend not to be. And on top of that, my experience has been that they appreciate the value of a good friend. Follow your interests and your values, be patient, and eventually you'll find into your people. reply",

          "text": "> People find me funny and when I do talk to people we have decent conversations (though small talk tends to bore me).\n> However that doesn’t lead anywhere and doesn’t bring me any kind of comfort or fulfillment You have two good things going for you here: - you're able to hold a conversation with people, even if it might not be as deep a conversation as you'd like it to be. - you're funny and can joke around with people. It sounds like you might have some surface level relationships and want deeper connections with people, which is totally understandable. Small talk can be boring at first, but it often opens the possibility of deeper relationships. I'd recommend low-stakes/activity based social interactions and seeing where they take you. Some ideas: - If you're on your way to the dining hall to get a meal, ask your dorm mates if they wanna join - Colleges have a movie night on weekends to see a movie for free, ask class mates, dorm mates to go. - Does your campus have like a rec/game center (think pool, air hockey, games etc). Another thing to ask people to. You might have to suffer through a lot of rejection before you get takers. After that you might have to suffer through small talk about the weather, where someone is from, what their major is, etc before you get to the deeper connections. reply",

It is of course a very complex topic, how to reach a state of emotional well-being, but you can start by taking better care of yourself, your health and your mood will also improve. Once your general state of health/emotional well-being improves, you'll see that this state of craving others also fades. So how do you improve your well-being/health? The cornerstone should be paying attention to your body, your sensations, feelings and listening. Resting well when tired. Eating well. Noticing your thoughts, especially negative thoughts about yourself. Learn to be kinder to yourself. If you do these things, you'll feel better and you'll become a bit more attractive to others. reply",

          "text": "I am quite a bit older than you, so my perspective is probably a bit different, but I have learned that friendships come from shared situations and experiences. You're not going to get it from books unfortunately, and the \"methods\" described in some books might come across as less genuine. First of all, have realistic expectations. You might not find that _one_ friend easily that can fulfill all your needs in one package, but you can become part of friend groups. Individual connections might grow from that. To get there: 1. Ensure you are in a place where things are happening, e.g. a larger town or city. This just gives you more options, but even small towns have things happening. 2. Become part of social hobbies, where people frequently meet at an organized time and place. e.g. team sports, local theater groups, book club, makerspace, cooking courses, etc...., whatever you have an interest in. Pick more than one if you can. Live firmly in the real world and not online. 3. Show up and keep showing up, you need to become a familiar face to people. One-off gatherings aren't great for this, but work with what you've got. 4. Participate. Are they looking for volunteers for event X, participate. Do they need someone to help do Y, participate. People are getting together to do race Z, participate. Someone needs an hour help moving some stuff, show up. No need to overdo it, just be there and be seen as a reliable part of the group. 5. Be patient. Especially participate in new things or initiatives, the groups are less firmly set in stone and it's easier to become part of something. Plus by participating you'll learn of other things happening in the community. If you \"don't like anything\", work with what's available and pick the things that are most OK. Part of liking things is doing them. If you're in a tiny village where they only play soccer once a week, well guess what, you're going to learn to play soccer now. The activity is the excuse to be around people. \nIf small talk bores you but small talk is what's on offer, have small talk. Life is not a stream of \"big moments\", the mundane is the glue. Do not expect anything. Keep any ego firmly in check. Go with the flow and be relaxed, whatever happens happens. People can smell neediness. Good luck ! reply",

People will just drop in. If your uni has college basketball or football, become a fan of the team and go to the games or watch em in the dorm. In college you have tons of people around you with all sorts of different backgrounds. Rest assured, someone will have common interests with you and will find you fascinating.

First - when you start working you will join a team of some sorts. Just be yourself and and make sure you attend all the team nights out. Second - traveling. You can join tour groups and visit some cool places. Don't do this to specifically find friends but you will be part of a group and have companionship for a brief period. Thirdly - dating. You will be able to find a partner. This is most peoples main companion in life. Fourthly - you could join a non-work team where you can have social interactions. I can't give too much advice on this one because I am not on a team like this. Fifthly - find a co-founder and start a company reply",

It can perpetuate itself despite your effort. I heard a saying once that is a hard truth that stuck with me. “If you want to be loved, be loveable.” Take stock of yourself and your confidence. Choose some areas for growth and accomplishment that you can get after independently. You’re in college so it’s a great time to build yourself with intention. For example, learn to play music. Get into a sport. Find your interests and get after them with gusto. Skills and interests will give opportunity for connection not just with people but with yourself. You can be so much more than you are today. reply",

          "text": "This isn’t what you asked but I would remove all social media from your phone. Nothing makes you lonelier than social media. Facebook and instagram should be the first to go. TikTok as well. Delete them and watch if you start to feel better. As for the other. Most friends I’ve ever met went like this: meet at an event relating to a shared interest (first you have to go to things, next you have to talk to people): find a person I genuinely like and respect, talk to them, do something together (study, eat, coffee), listen more than you talk, try to be as good a friend to them as possible. And I’m easy. Anyone wants to be my friend and I’ll be theirs. (So long as they treat me as a friend —don’t get me started about people who claim to be friends but who don’t treat me like a friend). This leads me to having some really weird friends. This also leads me to having friends who always treat me right. I’m an introvert so I tend to prioritize small numbers of deep connections over many shallow friendships. Everyplace I go I find the person I like best and I try to get to know them. I talk to them, listen, hear what they’re about, engage with things they find interesting. At 19 you’ve never had a friend? I honestly don’t believe it. I suspect you’re experiencing a depressive episode that is clouding your memory. Every child has had a friend. In grade school or middle school. Call your mother and ask her (I’m serious). I honestly think you’re not remembering clearly. It happens, I don’t know how to fix it, but looking for it might’ve a start. (If you haven’t I’d start looking for something you’re doing that drives people away. But I honestly don’t think you could be doing something without knowing it) Join clubs for things you find interesting. Get a job doing things you find interesting. Do favors for people, ask favors of people. Look for friendships in unlikely places. I once became friends with a professor who I did computer work for. We just got along. He invited me over for dinner with him and his wife. I was on his Christmas list (he made mix cds for people, I still have two he made me) reply",

No way to tell how useful they are for you in particular but pretty neat how many people responded to your personal question outreach on a tech forum. I don't have advice for you but I (and apparently lots of other folks here) feel for you and want good things for you just because you're a person and I think that's nice. The holidays can be pretty depressing but we're almost through and I think you'll be ok. I don't like to overpromise and I'm busy as hell but if you want another surface level friend (or at least some candid feedback) via email I'm game (hn @ <my username>.com). You mentioned this isn't really missing in your life so no worries but if you're feeling like the world is closing in maybe it can help. Good luck out there. You've got this. reply",

The problem when you are 19 is you don't realise that you are young. You are already using language like 'my entire life', your entire life is nothing right now, most of that time you were way too young to even have much of a life apart from being a child. So my advice is just relax, it doesn't matter. The issue is you think it does and I get you, because that is what everyone thinks at that age, but trust me when you are older you will understand, the issue is not much is going to help you right now and you prob think I am being a dick. But if you somehow remember this post in ten years time, you will be like 'that guy was right' Go explore and enjoy life. You can do that on your own and the more you do that and the more you can get from that, the more other people will want to be around you and then it will be up to you if you want to let them in or not. reply",

          "text": "Talk to a specialist like a therapist. Have them give you an honest assessment of how you present yourself. Maybe there's something you're doing or saying, or even the way you look, that you're not aware of and has caused people to keep their distance from you. Given how long you've claimed you've been like this, it's very likely behavioral; you're giving off some characteristic that is telling most people you meet that you're not worth spending time with. It might be something as simple as avoiding eye contact, or strange body language, or not knowing how to hold even a rudimentary, surface-level conversation. These are all skills that can be learned, especially when you're still young. I was in a similar situation when I was younger; grew up relatively isolated, barely had any friends, etc. I was socially deprived and abused as a child, and have a speech impediment that has made socializing difficult at times, but I learned how to listen and ask questions and get to know people, and I actually became quite the social butterfly for a good chunk of my 20s and 30s. Now that I'm older, I'm back to being more isolated for personal reasons, but my life is different now and I don't care as much about it, nor am I as reliant on social connections as I used to be. Frankly, I never felt I fit in anywhere, nor have I ever truly liked anyone beyond whatever immediate social gratification I needed filling in the moment. Friendships and connections have always been fleeting, overhyped, and overblown to me, especially when I look back at my life so far and struggle to think of anyone I still care about. Social connections are important when you're younger, but I've found the older you get, the less important they become, especially if you're smart about how you live your life. reply",

          "text": "This may not make you feel better, but I was lonely until maybe age 25. That was the year I graduated and started my first job and made my first two real friends. Before that I sat alone in the back of the lecture hall in University and hated on all the fun-having classmates. Age 25 was also when I met my first girlfriend that lasted less than a year. Age 34 was when I met my second girlfriend, who became my wife, and how we are separated. Long story short, I'm pretty content with my life now. You can say I'm a bit of a late bloomer. I thought I would be alone forever too, so much so that in college I aspired to be a Buddhist monk. What helped me was learning how to be less socially awkward through work interactions. When I was 32 I solo backpacked Europe which made me seem like a more interesting person. Also I'm a bit of a people pleaser and I was helpful to some key people in my life and they are now my good friends. Also I saved and invested a good chunk of my income which kind of helps overall with confidence. > People find me funny and when I do talk to people we have decent conversations (though small talk tends to bore me). However that doesn’t lead anywhere and doesn’t bring me any kind of comfort or fulfillment. I’ve attributed my lack of friends to something that places all the blame on me. Maybe I’m ugly, maybe I’m not funny enough, maybe I’m dumb. I've felt all those things at some point. You don't have to be attractive or funny or a genius. I've always walked around with these recurring fantasies of being some secretly impressive superhero that saved the day publicly or had all these amazing talents and everyone would realize my worth. I realize now that everyone is too into their own lives to care, and even if they seem to admire something about you, they see it from the perspective of how it benefits themselves. This is absolutely fine, and human. I guess what I'm saying is that you'll grow out of this phase. Right now I have all the friends I could ever want, ironically at a phase I'm my life I want to be more solitary. reply",

So let’s invert it: what prevents/kills friendships? - lying (for whatever reason)\n- talking too much about yourself\n- not asking people about their lives\n- being too private\n- being too judgmental\n- not empathizing - e.g. someone tells you about something hard they’re experiencing and you change the subject\n- not caring to help (also showing you don’t care about others that aren’t in your friend-zone)\n- not offering help\n- not being kind\n- not smiling (more like makes it hard for people to approach you) Most of us want/need friends. Most of us want/need to talk to others about our lives. Someone just moved to where you live. They need a friend. They will strike a conversation w anyone. Even people in your past probably wanted to be your friend (either coz they thought you were cool or they just needed a friend) - you can still be friends with them. I’ve become friends w people I met long after meeting them. Asking someone how they are is not so much about the other person. It’s mostly a social ritual. But if no one is asking you how you are, they might also be intimidated by you. As Aaron Burr would say: talk less, smile more - jk, do more of both. reply",

The accuracy gap feels especially stark compared to what was already possible years ago, even fully offline.<p>Is this primarily a model-quality issue, a streaming/segmentation problem, aggressive post-processing, or something architectural in Apple’s speech stack?

          "text": "I've built the same thing twice, first with Firecracker microVM, and second time using containers (gVisor). While the microVM route is more secure, it's more complicated and ops are tricky, but you can do some cool things to optimize startup time like when I was working on a function as a service platform, and to reduce TTFB, I trapped the `listen()` call, sent a VSOCK message to the VMM to trigger a freeze, snapshot the VM and save it as a \"template\". Then for every request, the snapshot was cloned (with some file system tricks like CoW) and resumed to handle the request. It \"just\" worked, but the orchestration was kludgy. In the second incarnation of this, I decided to use Linux containers with the gVisor sandbox. You can take a look at my project https://github.com/ammmir/sandboxer which uses Podman and gVisor underneath; it's good enough for a prototype. Later on, you can swap it out with Firecracker microVM, if necessary. In fact, I'm thinking of adding microVM support to sandboxer itself. If you wanted to do it yourself, swap out ContainerEngine() with a new implementation based on calling out to Firecracker. You'll need some way to do disk volume management (grow, clone, shared, cross-machine? good luck!), snapshots, etc. reply",

However starting from last year, due to the fact that these companies are becoming too dominant and I don’t trust them anymore I started applying a philosophy of avoiding to depend on them as much as possible unless customers explicitly require to use their services, for this reason we opted to always have our own solution and if needed integrate it with 3rd party solutions, this way we are not slave to FAMGE companies and we have full control over our product, it’s a small drop in an ocean but at least I sleep with more inner peace knowing that I am still contributing to the distributed architecture of internet. Sounds crazy, potentially less secure, and time consuming but still, I prefer this approach. Microsoft already F** Us by buying GitHub, others by stealing accumulated knowledge of stackoverflow, and forcing everybody to be AI dependent because they poured billions in it… I am not letting it happen again. reply",

You can browse and ride at https://app.skidmarks.club . I’ve done ~10 rides with it so far. Hoping I can convince my wife to use it and save myself $50 a month. That would be my most successful side project by a wide margin. There are probably a lot of examples like this. Vibe coded software people made for themselves, and other people could use it if they wanted. All of the code was reviewed by myself, and I’m a programmer, so not sure if that fits the description. I didn’t go through it with a fine-toothed comb, however, and 90% of the review was on my phone. I also did some non-vibed setup for hosting, db, email, etcetera. To me vibe coding is not looking at any of the code at all, but the definition reads a little loose to me these days, especially on HN, as: did an LLM “type” most of the code or did you? Either way I don’t think the term or definition is a big deal and probably not worth splitting hairs over. reply",

          "text": "I’m using the peloton only. I bought a little iPad/phone mount that I put on the handlebars. I run the app on my iPad, put the peloton in “just ride” mode (no subscription needed) and match the cadence/resistance with the web app. When it comes to cycling I’m a complete novice which is why the workouts have resistance as % of total (what peloton does) and I recently added an option where you can switch to relevant effort in settings. I appreciate this comment because I didn't know what people typically did for creating their own workouts and recently learned about FTP. I'm going to look into this! There are several interesting projects around peloton hacking that have served as inspiration: - [0] Peloton android app side loader: https://github.com/doudar/Openpelo - [1] Overlays metrics on the Peloton: https://github.com/selalipop/grupetto - [2] Bookmarklet to overlay cadence/resistance on web classes (this is what I started with): https://gist.github.com/rocng/2ff577948569ce0764b8938687841b... - [3] Decodes Peloton metrics from the serial port: https://github.com/ihaque/pelomon - [4] Transform Peloton into a smart trainer: https://github.com/doudar/SmartSpin2k/ These can be used in combination to use your Peloton with Zwift. Groupetto and Pelomon are really interesting. I'd like to integrate with something like Groupetto and use OpenPelo to have the full experience on the Peloton itself. That's kind of the end game, but I think the web app is the most approachable and easiest to get started with -- at least for me. reply",

I have a tiny tissue culturing lab in my home and wanted to manage media batches and their ingredients, cultures using the batches of media, inventory for media ingredients, and general inventory for running things. Cleaning, cutting, measuring, etc. I couldn't find anything which would allow me to keep stock of what I've got in the structure I needed, let alone while also project things like \"I've got enough inventory for n batches of y media\". And all of the half-measure inventory software was expensive as hell. I also built a solution for myself that was largely vibe coded. The underlying schema for inventories, batches, orders, cultures, etc was done in advance to help guide Claude along with documentation, but I'd guess 75 percent of the code is pure Claude. It has worked really well for a while now. Since it's just me using it and I'm able to roll with issues it causes or verify outputs on the fly if I want to, it's totally fine not being super polished. It meaningfully increases my productivity by allowing me to manage things in a way that fits my mental model and business. Like you, the cost of the project has been less than a subscription.

You typically take tissue from the part of the plant called the meristem, where cells are actively dividing and less likely to be infected, then rapidly disinfect and transfer the tissue to a sterile culture. It seems like it should be such a sophisticated and complex process, but all you're doing is cutting a chunk of fresh cells out and popping it into some goo where it can continue to grow. Extracting meristem tissue is usually the only difficult part. They can be extremely tiny. It takes a sharp eye and very steady hands. I've only done it for practice, never out of necessity. I'm pretty bad at it. It seems kind of like magic if you ignore the biologal machinery. It makes perfect sense why it works, yet it's also absolutely crazy that it does. reply",

          "text": "I’ve pushed a full-stack educational platform for parents, My DigitAlly, to production using what we call \"Systematic AI Collaboration\" (a matured version of vibe-coding).  \nIt isn't a static site; it’s a production app with:\nFull Auth: Google OAuth and email/password.  \nEngagement Engine: A node-cron system that automatically sends weekly tips to 200+ subscribers every Saturday.  \nDynamic Curriculum: A 5-block lesson flow driven by a JSON-based instructional design framework.  \nAutomated Resources: Auth-aware server-side PDF generation for parent checklists. The \"Methodology\" that made it work:\nWe moved from initial idea to production in four weekends while I maintained a full-time role. The key was moving past \"chaotic vibes\" and treating different LLMs like specialized team members:  \nA) Strategic Layer (Gemini Pro): Used for architectural decisions (React/Vite, Node/Express, PostgreSQL/Prisma) and product prioritization. B) Execution Layer (Claude Code): Used for heavy lifting—implementing the cron jobs, refactoring API patterns, and writing the test suite. C) TDD as the Guardrail: We never \"just coded.\" Every AI-generated feature followed a strict Test-Driven Development cycle using Vitest. If the tests didn't pass, the code didn't go to production. The result is a stable system serving 200+ active users with a codebase that doesn't feel \"schizophrenic\" because we maintained strict cognitive boundaries and context documents for the AI to follow. reply",

May a recommend some kind of \"disperse pieces to edge\" feature/button, (or perhaps automatic behavior, flag-to-enable or not), so that when you zoom-out a bit, you can automatically \"disperse\" all the pieces to the edge or at least \"equally space them\" in the available space, etc. I.e. the problem is a lot of time spent on moving the pieces off-of each other.  While this is more pleasent in real-life tactile space, not as much fun when using the computer to have to click-and-drag all the pieces around (of course, sorting them etc, is up to the user, but just some kind of initial \"see all the pieces in the space without them overlapping each other to the greatest extent possible depending on the total space avaliable given the current zoom settings\" ... reply",

It’s live, used by real users, and started making revenue recently (~$100+ in December, verifiable on TrustMRR). https://sololaunches.com While growing it, I focused a lot on distribution and SEO. By submitting it to relevant directories, I managed to increase its DR noticeably. That process later turned into a second small product, listmy.site, where I help others get similar directory-based backlinks. https://listmy.site Both are fairly simple full-stack apps, but they’re in production, have real users, and generate revenue — mostly built with LLM help + iteration.

To be honest the packaging part was probably the toughest bit and all the different ways each platform needs to build. - Probably my most \"successful\" one, at 450+ downloads on the Play store. https://formait.app/ - Free offline document formatting using LLMs to take a load of unstructured notes and give you a nice PDF output. You can load any GGUF model you throw at it as it's implementing llama.cpp, but uses Phi-4 out the box. It's actually quite a useful combination with Whistle, so thinking of integrating voice to text in at some point.

          "text": "Not sure this counts as \"successful\" yet (invite-only beta, still rough), but I'm building a full product almost entirely via LLM-assisted coding. Tangents ( https://tangents.chat ) is an Angular/Nest/Postgres app for thinking-with-LLMs without losing the thread. - Branch: select any span (user or assistant) and branch it into a tangent thread so the main thread stays coherent. - Collector: collect spans across messages/threads into curated context, then prompt with it. - You can inspect a \"what the model will see\" preview and keep a stored context-assembly manifest. Vibe-coding aspect: about 600 commits and about 120k LOC (tests included) and I have not handwritten the implementation code. I do write specs/docs/checklists and I run tests/CI like normal. What made it workable for something larger than a static page: - Treat the model like a junior dev: explicit requirements plus acceptance criteria, thin slices, one change at a time. - Keep \"project truth\" in versioned docs (design system plus interface spec) so the model does not drift. - Enforce guardrails: types, lint, tests, and a strict definition of \"done.\" - The bottleneck is not generating code, it is preventing context/spec drift and keeping invariants stable across hundreds of changes. If you define \"vibe coding\" as \"I never look at the code,\" I do not think serious production apps fit that. But if you define it as \"the LLM writes the code and you steer via specs/tests,\" it is possible to build something non-trivial.

Passed my reviews, was very pleased with results.\nQuite liking codex models, though still get faster iterations and good results with sonnet. reply",

          "text": "You could probably find a good answer anywhere, but the solution is in a more nuanced view. Some types of programming benefit more from AI tooling than others.  For example, prototyping seems to be the most fruitful area.  Also, writing small utilities is much easier, to the extent that a two hour job would now take only a few minutes.  That's where you get the multiplier posts from. But working in a large codebase using proprietary libraries is not a solved problem for AI (yet). It's just that the average engineer does not spend all of their time on things that can be sped up. Speeding up 1% of your time by a factor 20 simply does not help very much.  But for some roles, I'm sure that a 10% net increase in productivity is realistic. reply",

          "text": "I recently unpacked this idea a bit and wrote about it, so it's fresh on my mind. I definitely think that success in business can be a game that is a combination of luck and of skill, and most people will say that you need the former more than the latter. Without a little bit of luck, your skill means nothing, because you will perpetually put it to use in a way that never results in success. But I think that's not the full picture, and success can also be a game of skill and determination. Personally, I've been very unlucky in business. If you asked me if there was a catapult for my success, I would say there was none, though I tried to build multiple, and still do. They all failed, because like I said, I'm perpetually unlucky. But I've been very determined -- hardheaded, even -- and after nearly 10 years, I'm quite successful. Not quite above 7 figures yet, but that's really just a function of time -- and determination, of course. Sometimes you may even feel unskilled simply because you feel unlucky, but time has usually shown that to be a false assumption. Waiting on luck would've made me give up a long time ago, while skill with relentlessness determination has paid off for me. However, a hunger is not enough. You do need some skill, or at least some luck. reply",

Resilience, perseverance, luck and skill are all necessary ingredients to success, but success is never guaranteed on any time scale. > how much would you say luck or natural privileges make their way into someone's success? Not sure how to answer that. Luck has significant impact, as does whatever additional resources you can bring to the table. But I don't think those are determinative.

          "text": "> or are you a firm believer that with enough resilience and perseverance you'll finally make it? Well, I am a good example for this being total nonsense. I have wasted 10 years working on a project where I thought that time would make up for lack of money and employees. It did not. I just wasted a DECADE. Sure, I have learnt a ton, way more than I would have in any job. But still, a decade lost is a lot of missed opportunities. So no, resilience is not the answer. It helps, but in the end it is just one of many things that are part of success. And let me tell you, and you will not like hearing this, but I have been alive for quite some time and seen how things work, and the sad and cold-blooded truth is that success is pure luck and your input matters very little. Some people take the \"luck = preparation + opportunity\" approach, but that is complete bs. Imagine you have Al Pacino, Robert Redford, Denzel Washington and Daniel Day-Lewis going for a role in a movie. What determines who gets the role? They are all prepared, experienced, confident.. but in the end, the director may feel more connection of Pacino with the character than Day-Lewis. Does it mean that Pacino is better than Lewis? No. It's just luck that Pacino got better chemistry with the director. You could say that ah, but the opportunity aspect of the equation matters. But dues it? Beside these aforementioned actors, there was open call and 500 actors came to read for the role. So how does opportunity have any input here? It does not. Just like preparation where a fool can find himself in a strange situation but is able to grasp that opportunity and make something out of it. Luck is luck and we're merely it's subjects, like leafs in the wind. You are not guaranteed success in life. Instead, you should focus on the path, not the destination. You'll get there, somewhere, whatever there or it is. You have the power to pick the destination and walk the path, but you are not guaranteed you end up where you set out to. reply",

These discussions come closer to the stresses of the world than the typical HN post did historically. Well, at least to me.<p>They often quickly become “AI is bad” or “AI is amazing” in the discussions. I want to mention, I’m not pro or against either way. There doesn’t need to be sides to pick.<p>Do these posts that dominate the top make you happy? For me it’s turned HN into a place that stresses.<p>PS. I’m not asking for coping mechanisms, I’ve already cut my time here reading down a bunch :)</p></p></p></p></div>",

Nowhere else really can you get that concentrated & large a place to weigh in on something and get (fairly) intelligent, (fairly) rapid, (fairly) reasonable, (fairly) fast feedback -- even if you don't agree with all of it. Or, if you're not weighing in and getting responses, just to read the temperature on any discussion (of interest) and see reasonable views raised and discussed. PG always said something like, if you want to see how silly some people are just read the bottom-ranked comments on HN. Well maybe HN doesn't upvote the best.  But hype gonna hype.

Its 'fun' because i think i like to discuss but i have often than not the feeling i have to explain things While you mentioned LLMs: I do think that simplifing what LLMs are to a statistical parrot, shows how little people on hn know about LLMs, at least the ones commenting on it and repeating this every time. With the crypto garbage, i had plenty of people not responding to proper arguments from my side and it feels empty. HN is seldom stress. reply",

You need to train yourself to scan and decide which discussions are worth going into and which aren’t. This applies to any kind of forum or group chat. If I’m happy? I see HN less as a place for joy and more as a place to know what’s going on. It’s still useful. There’s a lot of BS mixed in, and that’s just part of the deal.

Remember when everyone was an Elon Musk fanboy and Tesla was going to save the world? I'm sure there are more, but that's just off the top of my head. There's always going to be a prevailing zeitgeist, and that's always going to dominate people's focus. But by and large, HN is the most intelligent, thoughtful community I've encountered, with people going out of their way to be kind and thorough in their replies, discussing things maturely, disincentivizing unhelpful and low-effort behavior. Not to mention the dizzying wealth of knowledge and experience the people here have. Obviously it's not 100%. There are plenty of harsh people and attitudes. But there's a lot of good discussion happening here, and that's what I try to focus on. I can only hope one day to be as interesting/inspiring a member of the community as some of the people I've seen on here. reply",

The biggest untold story in aviation is the battle between the pilots of small \"regional aircraft\" vs \"mainline aircraft\",  the former of which generate less value for the same amount of work and necessarily get paid less.  Unions have enforced \"scope clauses\" that have prevented a new generation of slightly larger regional aircraft which could lower costs at small airports and have no trouble getting filled as those lower costs get passed on to consumers.  As it is small airports are dying out,  harming smaller cities and towns and giving the \"left behind\" all the more reason to lash out. Similarly there is a lot of a talk of crisis in truck driving,  both at the local and long-haul levels.  My brother-in-law has a CDL and he is always talking about how inexperienced drivers seem to wedge their trucks on a bridge in Binghamton once a month,  stall out on the highway and get into accidents, etc. reply",

          "text": "Yes, I agree, I don't see cargo plane pilots being replaced here. Or indeed commercial pilots in general. Pilots are an unusual species because most of their utility and training is in the ability to deal with (very) edge cases. Indeed it is their ability to deal with unanticipated edge cases which is their most valuable attribute. Sure, most pilots won't need those skills during their careers, but the value when they do us immeasurable. Landing on the Hudson anyone? Equally it is the situational awareness and anticipation of problems which avoid things that could have escalated into disaster but instead become near misses. Sure 99.99% of their work is routine and could be done hy a machine. But that last 0.01% is thousands of lives, and billions in equipment and cargo. reply",

The stuff on the plane doesn't mean there are different safety checks. Auto pilot can be used for nearly everything after take-off and before landing, so I think you'll need to define \"AI\" here. I see people using \"AI\" almost interchangeably these days for things that plain old computers have been doing for a while now. Auto-pilot is not AI, its just a set of instructions (aka programming) given to a computer. Airports have designed approaches, large airports have multiple and there is a need for communication with other humans, reacting to dynamic environments including weather, other aircraft (both airborne and on taxiways) and having actual vision out the cockpit to see things. reply",

          "text": "Takeoffs are substantially more hazardous than landing. The margin for error is small, and the options for handling the unexpected are minimal. To be clear, take-off is more than just the runway. It extends to the point where the aircraft has sufficient energy, which can be translated into time. Flying a plane is all about energy. Speed, and altitude. One can be traded for another and both can be traded for time.  In other words, the faster the plane, the higher the plane, the more options available to the pilot. The most dangerous part of the flight is the initial climb just after takeoff. Speed is low. Height is very low. You are literally flying away from the runway. If an engine or 2 fail at this point crashing is a likely outcome. However how, and where, you crash matters a lot . By contrast landings are much safer, the airplane has excess energy to play with, and is heading directly at a nice long flat piece of ground. Auto-pilot takeoffs are \"easy\" only to the V2 mark, then they can get very complicated very quickly. reply",
