          "text": "I'm building CommitKit, a tool that turns your git history into résumé bullet points and STAR-based talking points for interviews. After being downsized twice in two years from senior engineering roles, I realized how painful it is to reconstruct what you actually accomplished at a job once you’ve lost access to your repos. Each time, I had to dig through memory and scraps of old PRs to remember what I’d built. The first time, I lost GitHub access immediately after the layoff notice. This time, at least we got 90 days of paid transition work.  But even with just 5 months in the role, I’d already made hundreds of commits. For engineers who’ve been around for years, that’s an impossible amount of history to summarize manually. So I’m building CommitKit, a command-line tool that scans your repo for your commits, groups them by feature or theme using embeddings, and generates professional CV bullet points or behavioral interview summaries.  It runs locally using Ollama, so your commit messages and diffs never leave your machine. The goal is to help people quickly turn real engineering work into clear narratives of impact, especially when time or access is limited. It’s still early: the clustering isn’t grouping commits quite as I’d hoped, possibly due to sparse commit messages or embedding quirks. But it’s been a great learning project: my first CLI tool, my first deployment on Render, and my first serious use of Ollama for local LLM inference. reply",

Spending directly from an envelope means your budget is always accurate — no syncing, no spreadsheets, no “catch-up” categorization.

Using the software inevitably gets me thinking about other things, and I explore those threads as well.

FinBodhi uses double entry so complicated set of transactions and accounts can be modeled (which happen often enough in users financial journey). We wrote about double-entry here: https://finbodhi.com/docs/understanding-double-entry We do use online services like firebase for auth, and some service to fetch commodity prices etc. But all your financial data is on your system (we use sqlite over opfs, in browser). For synching across devices, that data is encrypted with your key before it leaves your device. You can backup the data locally (if you are using chrome) and/or to your dropbox. It's designed so that we (the people building it) can't access your data. There are many more features, like multi-currency, visualizations, a sheet to use your data to do complex calculations like taxes, planning for your future etc. Feel free to try it out with the demo account (no sign-in required). Note: app doesn't work in Firefox private mode. reply",

          "text": "A tool for creating custom Tailwind-style color palettes for web and UI design that pass WCAG contrast requirements: https://www.inclusivecolors.com/ The interface is optimized to let you quickly explore and tweak multiple tints/shades at once so you can customize all colors exactly how you want e.g. try dragging vertically through the saturation curve in one motion to edit all the tints/shades at once, or shift whole curves horizontally by dragging between the dots on a curve. It uses the HSLuv color space, where (unlike say HSL) the WCAG contrast stays the same when you change the hue and saturation sliders. This makes it much easier to explore accessible colors choices as you know only changes to the lightness slider will impact the contrast. You can also switch from the WCAG2 contrast checker to using APCA, which is meant to correct for inaccuracies in WCAG2, such as it being too forgiving for dark mode color combos. Note the mobile version is more of a preview and the desktop version has more features. I probably need to add something like a tutorial as there's  a lot going on, but I've added more hints and tooltips recently.

I think it is also important to realize/point out that we do a lot of projecting and our child may have very different interests. Not saying that applies to you evolve2k , just wanted to make the general point. I set up a Linux machine with our daughter and while it was initially ok, she did not have much interest in the power/freedom and it only became a nuisance for her. Her school/friends use PowerPoint - there is a lot of friction trying work with them in LibreOffice. She wanted to do DTP-like things several times and the Linux options are not exactly... user-friendly. Etc. In the end we got her a Mac Mini. She can still open a terminal, use Homebrew, etc. if she ever develops an interest. Heck, she can use most free software. However, she can also do the stuff she is currently interested in much more easily. E.g., she uses Swift Publisher, which is a very simple/user-friendly DTP program, can collaborate on PowerPoint presentations when needed, etc. First and foremost listen to what your child is interested in. reply",

Multiplayer is a special category of risk in my opinion because I was an ever quest player and I built a feeling of responsibility toward the players that were relying on me and this led me away from schoolwork.

And Fortnite is actually an awesome game, it's the mugen we were all dreaming for. reply",

          "text": "> If you're doing things blindly in Linux, there's no point I digress. Everyone has to start somewhere and not everything has to have a point in the start When I started using linux, I got so fascinated by open source software that I would just search for software/software types and searched open source alternative to X and go to alternativeto or others and try it out etc. I used to copy paste dnf commands in the start and I still remember that phase. I think I learnt linux from myself and have given challenges along the way and I feel like there are things that I have still done blindly along the way (building linux isos) But the fact was that I still felt proud that I was atleast able to replicate the commands and able to have some familiarity with the process. I feel like if I wanted to able to know more about xorriso and cpio to a deeper degree to understand what wizard magic commands I was running to building custom linux iso s etc. Now I don't know about fortnite etc., I am a kid but surprisingly games don't interest me that much, I am way more in my movies / tv shows (just ended dexter s8) right now. There is some alienated feelings when people online my age mention the games they play but I think that games on linux are genuinely great support from what I know and my pc doesn't have anything beyond integrated gpu so yeah my cousins didn't want me to play much games and so they didn't buy a good gpu during the pc and I think they did succeed in this. Its complicated to how I feel the situation or even let alone think how I would even try to approach this situation if or when I become a parent myself. Honestly, parenting can be a bit hard but I still don't know if you should shun something that you think is faddish or low quality partially because I think that the best thing you could do (imo) is educate them on the positives on linux and how they might outweigh the benefits of fortnite in the short to long term in a fun manner. Its um complicated and there is definitely a feeling inside me on that i do some incredibly niche things which would be so complicated to explain to someone my age in my proximity. I think there is only one or two of my friends who actually know even 1% of the stuff that I do in linux (one of them had installed hyprland because of me haha) reply",

Do not get me wrong - I run Linux on all of my personal machines today, I play games on them, I know what's the state of gaming on Linux. I also know that every now and then I will get to at the very least read some logs to figure out what's going wrong, e.g. the native port of Civ VI was looking for a version of openssl whose time had passed. Further, relying on Wine/Proton inherently means you will always lag behind the bleeding edge in terms of DX APIs, as  wine/mesa people need to catch up to implement them. Even worse if it is not related to graphics,e.g. as the spatial audio APIs don't have an open source analogue that is ferociously trying to keep up with feature parity. And of course we also have kernel level anti-cheat. I have immense respect for everyone who is involved in making games (and windows software in general) work on Linux. But there will always be stumbling blocks when you are playing 2nd fiddle, and you've not been given the sheets. And nobody told you where the gig is happening. reply",

          "text": "When I think about enduring titles, I think about whether the kind of game that you'd pick up 20 years later and still consider to be a good game. I raised them on a curriculum of games starting with 80s titles and as they got older I progressed them all the way up into the 2020s so they would have a perspective on where particular gameplay mechanics came from. I see your point about the longevity of the Battlefield series and Fortnite, but my impression is people don't go back and play earlier Battlefield titles: I have always viewed them a little bit like the FIFA titles where there is a constant treadmill of needing to buy the latest version of the game. This is not true for Dark Souls, for example -- it's a sort of game you could play in decades and it would be as much of a masterpiece then it is today. I didn't really mean to compare the titles, but rather to use them as examples of titles that I would approve or disapprove of. My kids choose the games they play, but I exercise judgment in vetoing certain decisions. My example of the From Software titles were not games that I bought for them, or even played (in the case of Elden Ring), but rather titles that my boys were into because of their friend group playing it. They've been playing Night Reign lately and enjoying it. I think people read into my dismissal of Battlefield and Fortnite as indicative of some much larger pattern that they've had a really bad experience with, but I'm not sure that conclusion is warranted. reply",

I have 131 mp games from that release period, and only 33 of those are installed, and I only checked games that I figured would be likely candidates (i.e. I excluded Sniper Elite 5, Remnant 2, MechWarrior 5, etc).

You’re welcome to defend him and ban people who insult him in the name of upholding the rules. reply",

          "text": "I'm proud of my decisions and I'm not here to defend them. I'm here for the conversation because I'm interested in the topic. I vetoed Minecraft and replaced it with MineTest because Minecraft has the  hypixel community, which is essentially an MMO that's built inside of the world of Minecraft and dominates the Minecraft playerbase. I was worried that my 11-year-old would be too young to deal with a massively multiplayer game like that, so I prohibited Minecraft for him. The original joy of Minecraft when I first bought it off of Notch's site in 2009 was that you could build things and exercise creativity. I found that in the MMO versions of Minecraft, this is less of a focus. So instead I host a docker container with a minetest instance that we can all build in together. I also vetoed Roblox because I feel that the entire economy in that game is going to be a net negative, particularly the aspect where kids beg their parents to use real money to buy them Robux. But to your point, the list of things I veto is pretty small: I'm socially very liberal, and so the main thing I'm trying to filter for is games that are exploitative of their playerbase in some way. In the case of Battlefield and Fortnite, since I used those examples earlier, these are both games that my kids have independently decided they are not interested in; I think some folks read my original comment that I had removed Battlefield and Fortnite from my household. But if you look at my phrasing, I used the passive voice because it was basically a group decision to never really pick them up. I'm using weasel language because they sometimes go over their neighbor's house and have experience with those games, so I don't want to make it out like they've never played them at all. reply",

          "text": "As someone actually a teen. It is very interesting to share how I started my linux journey I had only got a computer in 6th grade but I was always fascinated by computers in the sense that I was trying to run blindly termux scripts from youtube etc. to run windows programs or linux etc. and I had even successfully done these things earlier But after 6th grade getting a pc, I was trying to learn some python in covid and uh, lets just say that vscode wasn't happy with a 500 mb ram win 7 pc I even installed droidcam/womic etc. and it was a real treat on using your phone as a camera for sometime during online classes Then uh my cousins and brothers bought me a new pc (technically my mum gave the money, so shoutout to you mom, i love you) and I am still rocking that pc That pc has a very nice specs and they are so good except for one thing which is the gpu. it has just gotten an integrated intel 580 graphics card and barely any high power or mid power games can work on it So I was having some games like valorant,portal etc. but mostly it became minecraft and I wasn't enjoying the other games I was watching a lot of privacy content on youtube at the same time and how invasive microsoft is and how linux is just better in that sense. Now I used to play valorant. It used to work on 60 fps but idk what triggered it to become extremely unplayable for me to the point that it was a godsend if it worked on 20fps Tried doing everything but I realized that I am not playing a game at 20 fps and neither do I want to. It has kernel level access and its created by a game which has some chinese influence and Its not even about politics but I would actually not play american games with kernel level access either That being said, First I thought of just reinstalling windows but then realized that if I am actually going through the hassle of re-installing system then might as well use linux (I thought backups were meh and I didn't have any important stuff [i think] anyways, although I wish I would've backuped my fathers occasional folders but eh its 2-3 years now) Instaled nobara after watching linux experiment. To get the best linux gaming. It is so funny but I thought that nobara/glorious eggroll had built all of this from scratch in start, like It was gnome and I was like wow did he make this and that and that oh my god, so cooool Copy pasting dnf commands :sob: (I guess I am on cachy but old habits die hard regarding copy pasting, I still do it sometimes) Then I went to raw archlinux, it was a mess in the start trying to experiment. I had arch kde and the experience was definitely something Personally I used to play minecraft (with prism launcher) and not many games. And I genuinely wanted to play with arch more than gaming. I then was on arch kde and I think I downloaded some games and tried to run it and lets just say that sailing the seas on linux was a very hacky solution but i was able to do that Lets just say that your boy out here was installing a lot of software bloating disks and wanted minimalism and re-installing systems again and again (and always not making backups,  I think I barely make backups even now :sob:) I went from arch kde -> voidlinux iirc -> artix (realized that non systemd systems can't run vscode etc. a bit of a mess) -> arch hyprland iirc for a very long time and it was here where I tried to genuinely install proton and make games work and it had a very high learning curve (1-2 years flexing my neofetch) -> cachy hyprland (just 1-2 months ago) -> cachyos niri right now Personally I would say that Linux is a W in everything but personally I just didn't have a graphics card at all to play modern games From retrospect, regarding gaming, why not just buy older versions of playstation or xbox, are they not specifically designed for gaming itself. It can be a good physical level of seperation as well I don't know what I do with linux honestly, I just do whatever my heart wants, so if someone asks me my hobbies, I genuinely don't know what to say, tinkering with linux/open source is the answer that I give (building custom linux isos, doing random open source cool stuff etc.) I then go see on normal discord servers, the amount of games people play and I am like damn The number of games I have completed/enjoyed can be counted on both my hands or maybe even just one reply",

The same goes for my colleague who is also a musician and DJ - their kids can hear a song and instantly understand all the layers of production and instrumentation, whereas most children and adults are just nodding along to the beat. If I consider most of the things I do in my life, I am interacting with them at very shallow and superficial level versus an expert, and I would assume the same is true for you. reply",

Tech really wants us to not interact with things or to create a superapp to abstract everything to get a bigger portion of the cake I personally wouldn't be surprised if with things like AI browsers, we might be coming to the point where they genuinely just convert the whole internet into just a chatbot and would interact with the computer and everything on your behalf in the same interface (most likely) I am pretty sure that if this interface or something similar comes true then most people might not even know about things like www. or internet links in general, and we might be shocked in the same way we are right now to them not knowing what files are. reply",

          "text": "Sorry I was THAT child in school.  While I now definitely have some technical knowledge, 10-year-old me, definitely wasn't that smart. This is just not true.  LibreOffice is way easier to understand as a child, since all the functionality is available and discoverable as a menu/tree structure, as opposed to the toolbar mess of MSOffice.  That might be useful for professionals, but when you are a child, the unpredictability of these ribbons is just confusing.   I just want to format this thing.  Click on it.  Search the ribbon for the thing.  It's not there.  Click slightly differently.  Now the ribbon header changed.  Click that back.  Where is it?  Still not there.  Shit, how do I do that?  Describe it in the browser.  I have no clue, how anything is called.  When I happen to find something, everything is in some foreign language where I can only say \"apple\" and \"house\" in.  Also there are tons of advertisements and useless whitespace everywhere. Screw it, I am just opening Notepad (because Notepad++ is not installed and I will only figure out how to use portable programs from an USB stick in 2.5years)  do some drafts and finish it at home with a sane office program.  In LibreOffice at home, I can find the functionality I need independent of finding out how I need to click on the item to apply it.  Also when I click on something, on the left there is a property window open, which lists all the basic properties I can change. MSOffice has moat for professionals who already know how to use it.  It is not friendly for children who have never used a word processor. Converting MSOffice documents to LibreOffice is not that hard, especially as a child, since my mates also have not used a word processor for decades, and have not used fancy formatting.  And then you come around the corner with a poster designed in Scribus.  They are all like: what you can do that?  And guess with whom, people want to be in a group for a presentation, and who people will trust when you tell them to please save it in this format? reply",

Having poor MS Office compatibility isn't just a footnote, it's a showstopper issue that will make these people's jobs harder every single day. Making people's job harder and take more time is a great way to make them hate something. As for not having cloud features and having an old style XP era interface: These are also points that are only positive for a specific type of computer user wants computing to return the earlier, simpler era of computing they fondly remember. For everyone else, that \"cloud crap\" is a helpful feature for getting their job done and that XP era interface makes it feel like they're stuck using outdated software. I understand you don't use or like the new features, but average people who use this software in their jobs might actually benefit from the new features and new interface. reply",

The primary reason kids would use office tools is for classwork, which is not dissimilar from job work.

However, once you get into group projects (which are very common, in my experience) being the odd one out who can't work with others is really not good.

I am a teen and so when I had made the switch from windows -> linux, he was a little weirded out and I tried to do things in libreoffice but he just genuinely thought it was excel itself and he was trying to use his old experience for some niche thing and I was trying mine to figure out libreoffice etc. Um, it was decent, I still use libreoffice but at that time, I just decided to open up google sheets (iirc) and just use google sheets for excel purposes and I think that later he even preferred it since he could then go to someone else and have them open up that excel as well We never had collaboration on powerpoint presentations or etc., our school work was basically build a presentation and mail it I live in the east tho so I am not sure how the western world's schooling system is entrenched in powerpoints collaboration etc. I don't like google generally but atleast their suite is in the web and so I can naturally use it in linux as well without any limitations unlike the web versions of microsoft's monopolistic suite of softwares. That being said, I am still on mac which my brother gifted me partially because I only have a computer and sometimes I like the portability of a laptop but I genuinely feel annoyed or I do feel limited by what I can do on mac. Yes I have installed homebrew etc. but linux actually feels more comfy for me to use to be honest, I think I like both but I personally prefer linux more as well. I would recommend if possible to try to buy them something like a old laptop and boot them linux as well to try to teach them your knowledge and try to bond with them. There is just this instant sense of gratification I get when I realize that my pc is mostly open source and it has even gotten to the points of being reproducible and bootstrappable so somebody would technically be able to even re-architect or (myself) as well the way I use my computers in this open source manner. All of the things open source.. Wild. I personally have starred a lot of projects along the way I have found and I am pretty sure that some of these projects could genuinely be useful to people. I am sure you know some really cool open source projects as well and maybe you can share these softwares which can help them in the process as well. I have found it extremely surprising in how many things can be done by already built open source softwares. It is not as if I don't use proprietory software, I think there are some trade-offs to be made I decided to use obsidian partially because I found it to have a better plugin system than logseq (? sorry if this isn't the correct name) and I really like the excalidraw plugin in obsidian. reply",

That really pisses me off when I hear some horror stories like that.<p>Is this unfounded? Or do I have a right for some concern? It's obviously easier for viewers to just see public code repos and browse without ever requesting access so I know I'm losing some traffic (from my portfolio site)<p>I was thinking the alternative would be just linking my demo on my portfolio site as a proof of concept that yes I made it, yes it works, and if you're curious , here's a link to the code u can request independently of github.<p>Thank you in advance.</p></p></p></div>",

But sometimes, when implementing non-trivial features, I struggle to come up with good implementation.\nThis prevents submitting working code early.\nAnd when I feel I'm delayed, my anxiety kicks in, and I have this urge to implement cleaner code and more features than expected even though all of my coworkers just want working code.\nAnd I feel more pressure, more urge to implement well, more anxiety, but it makes me procrastinate (I'm working from home so I can just lie down on the bed when I'm depressed).\nSometimes I manage to implement, sometimes I give up and the feature is not implemented or assigned to a coworker.\nBut in few cases I end up with severe depression, stop functioning, and finally quit the job. I can handle this better than before after making same mistakes again and again, but still happens sometimes. reply",

I don’t publish that much code because I’ve traditionally been in roles that discourage open source, but after 20 years in I’ve accrued a portfolio on GitHub of personal projects. No one has ever commented on any of it. On internal projects it’s different- my code is the teams code. It’s never actually been mine. My colleagues comment on it, provide feedback and help me improve. After all, we are all supporting it. I’ve had almost exclusively positive experiences doing this, even if sometimes I had to change some of my priorities or opinions on things. At this point I have a fancy enough title that, in the rare cases I get to write code or docs, people lower in level are willing to give me feedback and everyone higher in level is too busy. I miss it- it’s hard to improve without feedback and genuine collaboration is fun. So I say publish it. Most likely no one will say anything. Maybe you’ll get some feedback and you’ll normalize managing it. Maybe you’ll find a collaborator. Maybe you’ll get flamed by a troll and you’ll learn there are idiots on the Internet. But most likely a few people will just look and say nothing. An aside, this assumes you are not in some toxic subculture.

Anyone who strips the MIT license headers off your source isn't really likely to be somebody who's going to do something worthwhile with it. Grown-up programmers don't do that. And, I don't think I have EVER heard of a grown-up programmer claiming that somebody \"stole their code\". Is this something that actually really happens? I don't think so. tbh, as someone who hires programmers, \"here's a link to the code u can request independently of github\" would be a dead giveaway that you are a junior programmer. It seems decidedly weird to me. Grown-up programmers don't really do that. If you want to share the code, then share it. If you don't, then don't. There's so much freely available source code available already that it seems vanishingly improbable that anyone is ever going to \"request the code\"; but if you just post it on github, there is a vanishing probability that somebody might actually find it useful, and.. well.. use it! And if you are expecting potential employers to \"request the code\", don't. If you are a junior, it's a given that your code will be awful. Perfectly expected, and perfectly normal. Once you're hired, that will be fixed. Not a problem. My vote: just publish it. Do it with purity of intent. You want to make code available that other people might find useful.

When there are enough takers, people become demotivated and reluctant to collaborate.

Don't feel bad taking retaliatory measures against those who have already fired the first shot by claiming your work as their own. It's fine if they copied your code and then gave appropriate credit, though.

          "text": "If someone else steals your work, you should be proud. They found it to be valuable. If they managed to sell it or build something with it, they’ve demonstrated that you can do the same. Use it as a learning experience. Keep in mind that you are in control of what people are allowed to do with your software. By default, your code is unlicensed even if it is public, which means no one else can distribute it or change it or do much of anything with it. Thus, if someone uses it and claims it to be theirs, you can sue them if you want to. However, instead of leaving your code unlicensed, I would recommend choosing an open source license and applying it to your code when you make it public. There are many to choose from! By applying a license to your code, you are establishing a clear framework for what other people are and aren’t allowed to do with it. And it’s legally enforceable. In fact, there are organizations that may step in to help you if someone violates your license or challenges it in court. For example, my preferred license is the Mozilla Public License. If someone tried to challenge me on any part of that license, Mozilla would have a vested interest in defending it, since it’s their license and they use it, too. Their lawyer is even available to chat with over email. I once reached out to ask if I could make a small tweak to the license without causing headaches. They got back to me within a few days and said it would be fine. That gave me a lot of confidence to continue using it. Some licenses are very permissive, such as MIT. Others are much more restrictive, such as GPL. The MPL, which I use, is somewhere in between. What’s right for you really just depends on what you consider to be fair. And every project can be different. Maybe you build some small tools that you release under MIT, essentially donating them to all of humanity. Meanwhile, you create a startup and build a product where you keep some of it private and release parts of it publicly, licensed under the GPL, because you don’t want huge corporations stealing the work for your day job without reciprocating. That’s a relatively common approach. Whatever you decide, just make some of your code public. The feedback and experience will be well worth it. Good luck! reply",

It's typical for programmers to grow, try more approaches, and see better solutions in hindsight). The lazy cheaters only cheat themselves out of getting experience and learning by writing the code themselves. It doesn't even matter whether you publish your code or not, because they'll just steal from someone else, or more likely mindlessly copypaste AI slop instead. If someone can't write non-trivial code themselves to begin with, they won't be able to properly extend and maintain it either, so their ripoff project won't be successful. Additionally, you'll find that most programmers don't want to even look at your code. It feels harder and less fun to understand someone else's code than to write one's own. Everyone thinks their own solution is the best: it's more clever and has more features than the primitive toys other people wrote, while at the same time it's simpler and more focused than the overcomplicated bloat other people wrote. reply",

          "text": "Old head engineering serial founder here with a partial grey beard that from reading the comments herein sees myself and my security practices as an edge case, an experienced lonely outlier it appears. First to the OP mentions about schooling experiences which struck a nerve with me, I would add that in my 4th year of College programming classes; Assembly and C, I too helped the other 6 people in my class while in the computer lab. This was the 1990s long before the dotcom boom and classes were very small in software development, folks even laughed at me for taking programming then however they do not laugh at me now. The point in this paragraph is that I too had my entire projects stolen and turned in verbatim by 3 others in my class and the professor, who was a systems programmer at Bank of America at the time, knew whose work they had turned in since I was the only person in class that understood it. She spoke to me in private and advised me to not share my code with anyone and dumbass me should have carried that forward into the real world then. Code theft has been a thing since code was first written and this should be no surprise when most people have no idea how to formulate large sets of code into a unified function for business let alone the time it takes to write and prove that approach. I started writing software professionally in the 1990s and was the architect and sole developer of a payment processors gateway that had PayPal and several other Fortune 500 clients for many years. My company acquired another small entity within this time and unknown to us our action of interest proved to be the point of proof needed to set in motion a lawsuit from an outside third party. That third party claimed that the acquired owner and his business we bought stole their code which in time laid the interest for us to acquire that business. 10 years later and after many a court hearing that acquired owner lost the lawsuit after he was proven to have stolen the code and built a business making significant revenue from that stolen code. He was fined 5+ MM USD and had his wages garnished which he likely is still paying to this day. Yes, code theft is a real thing but many here likely have no idea. Fast forward some time later after I had entirely rewrote my intellectual property from the ground up again into version 5 and I founded another payment processor with my intellectual property work, Yup, that code was then too stolen and used to build yet another competing business by a former business partner that felt he was entitled to my intellectual property. Yes, code theft is a real thing or maybe it is just me? A few weeks back I attended a patent meeting discussion North of Washington DC that had several tens of people there, many younger than myself. The lawyers running the presentation were cracking jokes about the current and coming tsunami of lawsuits involving A.I. code theft and after the presentation over half the people there in discussion groups stated they were attending in an attempt to patent their A.I. solutions. The lawyers very clearly stated that they would most likely be wasting their time and money as the courts were now wise to the trolls that have no intention of applying the patent they seek to a use other than just blanket patenting mass ideas in a hope to cash in on a patent lawsuit down the line. After nearly 30 years of doing this it has taken many scars to understand the correct approach to protect my intellectual property that is still powering past payments companies of which I founded and built. I am now applying those lessons in a way for my next venture that will ensure only I can execute my ideas with my code since the world is overrun with many liars and cheats that now exist only to claim others work as their own in hopes to get rich easily from all the big tech hysteria and FOMO. I will continue on doing what I do using my old school proven ways to build what I am building now that continues to excite me even more with each passing day as that idea manifests into my next business venture that everyone alive will need, energy storage. Your mileage will vary greatly from my own but I leave everyone with this point to think on; why hasn't Coke published their recipe on a publicly open forum? Code is just a recipe after all but maybe it's really the chef that matters? Stay Healthy! reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Is anybody still using TUI applications for business?<p>My family company is a wholesale distribution firm (with lightweight manufacturing) and has been using the same TUI application (on prem unix box) since 1993. We use it for customer management, ordering, invoicing, kit management/build tickets, financials - everything. We've transitioned from green screen terminals to modern emulators, but the core system remains. I spent many summers running serial and ethernet cables.<p>I left the business years ago to become a full time software engineer, but I got my start as a script kiddie writing automations for this system with Microsoft Access, VBA, and SendKeys to automate data entry. Amazingly, they still have a Windows XP machine running many of those tasks I wrote back in 2004! It's brittle, but cumulatively has probably saved years of time. That XP machine could survive a nuclear winter lol.<p>I recently stepped back in to help my parents and spent a day converting many of those old scripts to a more modern system (with actual error-handling instead of strategic sleep()s and prayers) using Python and telnetlib3. I had a blast and still love this application. I can fly around in it. Training new people was always a pain, but for those that got it—they had super powers.<p>This got me thinking: Are other companies still using this type of interface to drive their core operations? I’m reflecting on whether the only reason my family's business still uses this system is because of the efficiency hacks I put in place 20+ years ago. Without them, would they have been forced to switch to a modern cloud/GUI system? I’m not sure if I’m blinded by nostalgia or if this application is truly as wonderful as I remember it.<p>I’d love to hear if and how these are still being utilized in the real world.<p>P.S. The system we use was originally sold by ADP and has had different names (D2K, Prophet21). I believe Epicor owns it now (Activant before).<p>P.P.S. Is anybody migrating their old TUI automation scripts to a more modern framework or creating new ones? I’m super curious to compare notes and see what other people are doing.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Many (most?) older retail businesses still use TUIs. They're reliable, consistent, and orders of magnitude faster than GUI systems. When I worked ar Sherwin Williams, I got good enough with the TUI that customers could rattle off their orders while I punch it into the computer in real time. It's absolutely crazy that a well designed TUI is so much faster. It turns out that if you never change the UI and every menu item always has the same hotkey, navigating the software becomes muscle memory and your speed is only limited by how fast you can physically push the buttons. The program had many menu options added and removed over the decades, but the crucial part is that the hotkeys and menu indexes never, ever changed. Once you learn that you can pop into a quick order menu with this specific sequence of five keys, you just automatically open the right menu the moment a customer walks up. No thought, just pure reflex. UX absolutely peaked with TUIs several decades ago. No graphical interface I've ever seen comes even close to the raw utility and speed of these finely tuned TUIs. There is a very, very good reason that the oldest and wealthiest retail businesses still use this ancient software. It works, and it's staggeringly effective, and any conceivable replacement will only be worse. There simply is no effective way to improve it. Edit: I will say that these systems take time and effort to learn. You have to commit these UI paths to memory, which isn't too hard, but in order to be maximally effective, you also have to memorize a lot of product metadata. But the key is that it really doesn't take longer than your ordinary training period to become minimally effective. After that, you just pick up the muscle memory as you go. It's pretty analogous to learning touch typing without trying. Your hands just learn where the keys are and after enough time your brain translates words into keystrokes without active thought. It's a beautiful way to design maximally effective software. We've really lost something very important with the shift to GUI and the shunning of text mode. reply",

For several years, MacOS followed a strong UX convention with consistent keyboard shortcuts, menus, layout order, and more. Similarly, Microsoft started with the same, but with everything reversed. At the time, most major cross-platform apps followed these conventions. Two periods broke these rules: the expansion of web apps and Apple's pivot towards the consolidation of everything into iOS. First was the dawn of web apps. Faced with two opposing standards, web apps didn't know which model to follow. Business sites stuck with MS standards, while design-centric sites followed Mac standards. As those broke consistency, cross-platform apps gave up and defined their own standards. Mobile platforms tried to establish new standards. iOS was mostly successful, but started slipping around iOS 7. Material Design was supposed to standardize Android, but Google used it for all Google products, making it more of a standard for the Google brand than Android. The second started around WWDC 2019. At that point, Apple deprioritized UX standards to focus on architecture updates. The following year, Catalyst was literally a UX catalyst, introducing two competing UX standards for MacOS. From that point forward, Apple really hasn't had a singular UX standard to follow anymore, but they seem to be marching towards iOS standards for all devices. reply",

While in many ways it was better than the GUIs we have now , using the mouse was an absolute must , which prevented it from ever getting as efficient as a TUI. Yes there were keyboard shortcuts, but they were never sufficient to use the machine or any application without a mouse. Also they had to be completely memorized to be useful. reply",

I think sublime text was one of the first to bring the TUI style super-powers into the modern desktop UK, where you press some random keyboard shortcut (e.g. cmd-p in sublime) and you can instantly start typing a command. Another thought I have had for a long time is that when GUIs like Mac and Windows were taking off, they were often described as more \"user friendly\" than TUIs. I always thought this depended on the kind of user. A lot of effort went into prioritising making it possible for an untrained user to use a system, but making it fast for someone with experience was no longer important. reply",

Anything you can do on a Mac (except for entering text) was to be done with, and designed around, the mouse. Keyboard \"shortcuts\", so called as a quicker way to issue (some, but not all) menu commands, were a sop to power users but really were an addition, not essential to use of the program.

AAAlpha Great for day1 users that are still there and started with just 3 options but new users are screwed. The arrangement started to stop making sense circa 1995. I’ve seen the same thing where parts shelves were sorted by manufacturer (to make re-ordering by manufacturer simple). When they moved to automatic inventory, shelves didn’t matter anymore and if a part was made by manu1 but now manu2, they’d keep putting it with manu1 because “that’s where everyone’s gone to look for it for the part 20 years”. All you had to know was who made that part in 2003 when auto-inventory stopped forcing them to be consistent by manufacturer to know which shelf to pick from. Easy!

So you vaguely see a screen change, a menu move or an overlay pop up, only to instantly disappear. The user doesn't need to know what's happening on screen, because they trust their fingers and the system to do the right thing. I learned this while creating some autohotkey scripts: I could have the macro click before the button was shown on the screen. This also created some problems where users would unintentionally hit their scroll wheel after clicking and change a 1 to a 7 on the next screen before it even appeared. That wasn’t good… reply",

There is no need to highlight or underline anything. Amazingly this was done without having to use any too obscure labels (but I doubt it would be fun to try to translate it to other languages). Almost every function is two or three single letter key-presses away, and after using the application for a while you will have memorized more and more of those. Some frequently used functions have their own special single-key shortcuts as well, so instead of having to press C-P (to open the Clip menu and then select Paste) you can just press the ' key, saving the user a key-press every time they  do that. reply",

We supplied many of their lubricants and they had TUI they still used on one of their machines to enter the orders from our company. It was the last of their legacy products, but worked incredibly well. \nWe had very little issues ever with the system. Our Oracle ERP Net Suite? Had three people dedicated to making sure it ran smoothly. I still remember some of the guys I used to talk to at Toro were \"lifers\" who were always talking about how easier things were before all the SAAS and ERP software came on the scene. The stories they had were pretty entertaining. reply",

Same game, just different UI implementations, and both tend to be about equally laggy, or usually the GUI version is probably less laggy, since you can just blit glyphs without the overhead of terminal escape codes etc to draw the same symbols in the TUI. And Brogue just uses SDL, not a game engine, so that is not relevant at all. But your snarky reply is probably also wrong anyway, since I would be surprised if there is no business software made using game engines. Tesla is known to have used (but not anymore?) Godot for making GUIs for their in-car displays for instance. I have bought applications (not games) made using both Godot and Unity. Not saying it would be a great idea, in general, to use those engines for business applications, but people are not known for always using the best possible tools, are they, and it certainly would work in theory? Not very familiar with Unity, but Godot has very nice GUI widgets. Same style of WYSIWYG editor like old Visual Basic or Delphi really. You drag widgets to place them on the screen, set properties, add scripts to react to different events. The entire Godot IDE itself, a very non-trivial application, is implemented using Godot's own GUI framework. https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/ui/index.ht... reply",

More experienced ones will try to annoy some to attract others. I have no idea what's going on with https://stripe.dev for example. It's beautiful. There's a pointless fractal in the corner. The link to Stack Overflow is equally pointless. But in the end, I get the impression that Stripe does some precision shit which is what I want for a payment gateway. reply",

          "text": "You're looking at the wrong designers.  Tufte and Vignelli had great collateral and were appropriately restrained in design elements they used.  I don't know if I saw Rams or Esslinger's web sites, but I saw printed material they produced.  Definitely on the \"restrained\" side. As to why younger designers insert their busy selves in designs?  I have a history of making tools.  I learned early that good tools allow the user to think of the tool as an extension of the self.  When you hammer a nail, you don't think about the hammer, you think about where the nail is (or maybe where your thumb is.)  When you twist a wrench, you (hopefully) think about how much torque you're delivering, not about how finely crafted the wrench is. But there is a school of thought that everything must be a delighter.  You must make your tools so finely crafted your users can't ignore them.  I blame Steve Jobs (or maybe people mis-interpreting Jobs exhortation to make insanely awesome products.).  I think Jobs and Lowey and Issingler were talking about the experience of the artifact being awesome, not every visual aspect of the tool.  If making something flashy detracts from the use of the tool... That's not insanely awesome, imho.  But I think this is something you learn over time and you're rewarded at d-school for ostentatious demonstrations of design concepts. In short ... There's a lot of bad design out there because there are a lot of insecure inexperienced designers out there who work cheap and customers who wouldn't know good design if it bit them on the ass. (Not that design frequently takes an ass biting form.) And remember... If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like your thumb reply",

All 3 of our founders have spent years in the trenches writing software and still do it almost every single day. We know the only way to build the world's best code editor is by equipping every single member of the team to do the best work of their career. We've raised $42M to support our ultimate vision, a new way to collaborate on software, where conversations about code remain connected to the code itself, instead of being tied to aging snapshots or scattered across different tools. The first step was creating a high-quality editor to serve as the user interface. Now this new investment lets us expand to tackle the next phase of our plan. We're developing a new kind of operation-based version control that incrementally tracks the evolution of your code with edit-level granularity, and we're integrating it into Zed to make collaboration, both with agents and teammates, a first-class part of the coding experience.

Contact us if you want to be part of the first team to crack-the-code of celluloid. We seek renegade coders who want to make a dent in the universe, and have the intellectual-firepower to deliver the holy-grail: Digitally modeling photon-pathway interactions in REAL analog film strata.

We are looking for a full stack engineer to join as a core member of the off-robot software team. This is the software that plans, configures, operates and creates insights from data collected from the robots. You would work across the whole cloud-stack, consisting of Frontend (React), Backend (Typescript / Go), Infra (Terraform / AWS / GCP). The cloud software team is still small, meaning you get a chance to help set priorities, guide long-term architectural direction and figure out how to best help our users.

          "text": "Phrasing.app | Co-founder | EUROPE REMOTE Phrasing is a bootstrapped company dedicated to building the most effective and efficient way to learn a language. I’m a polyglot myself and have always struggled for a few main reasons: 1. Apps only ever focus on taking you from 0-1, never from 1-100. 2. If you have any experience in the language, it’s really hard to pick it up after a few years. 3. Language learning apps are always ugly, clunky, ugly, and just stressful to use. And ugly. 4. No apps support maintaining and learning multiple languages simultaneously 5. Apps only ever support the major languages, leaving minority languages in the dust So, I set off to build my dream language learning application, and a quick 2 years and 10,000 hours later I’d built Phrasing. It’s launched, it’s live, it has (happy) paying daily users, and I myself am using it to learn 18 languages. The product is ready to go, and the business is already growing organically. I’m looking for someone cracked to come in in a co-founding capacity and eventually take over the backend (elixir) codebase from me. No experience is required so long as you’re passionate, talented, and hungry. If you’re interested, and located in Europe, send me an email at hn@phrasing.app. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">As their revenue dwindles due to new technology—such as email reducing the number of letters sent—and increased competition from other shipping companies, I think the USPS needs to enter the payment processing business. Instead of relying on thousands of middlemen like PayPal, Stripe, and similar services, USPS would be a far more reliable and trustworthy option for legal businesses. The fees generated could not only finance the entire agency but also generate profit for the U.S. Treasury.<p>The rule would be simple: as long as you are not violating a federal law, USPS payment processors would handle your transactions. Do you know how many legitimate businesses currently struggle or cannot operate because of these parasitic middlemen?\nUSPS could operate similarly to the Bank of North Dakota, legally unable to deny banking services to someone without strong legal grounds.\nThis move could save the agency, eliminate parasitic middlemen who siphon money and favor certain clients, and provide a viable path for many businesses to remain operational.\nI know that in the 1990s, USPS wanted to offer email services, but the DOJ blocked it. So, my idea isn’t as crazy as it sounds—people smarter than me in the agency were already thinking about expanding USPS’s services thirty years ago.</p></div>",

Email: gio97niko@gmail.com About me: Hi, I’m Giorgi — a Full-Stack Web Developer with around four years of experience in frontend development and about a year in backend and AI-related work. I’ve collaborated in various settings — from freelancing individually to working with teams in digital agency and startup — which helped me develop strong adaptability and teamwork skills. Most of my career has focused on building and maintaining WordPress websites (custom themes, ACF, Twig, Gutenberg), but over the past two years I’ve also been involved in React/Next.js projects. Recently, I’ve taken a growing interest in backend and AI development through my work at Onconest, an AI-powered health startup, where I contribute to both backend and AI implementation. I’m passionate about clean, accessible web experiences — over the last year, I’ve led accessibility improvements for large-scale projects in a US-based digital agency. I’m always eager to learn, improve, and take on new challenges where I can deliver results and make an impact. reply",

This includes web apps, websites, landing pages, copywriting, and I can assist with frontend development where needed. My background of launching my own products and being a full stack developer helps me create practical designs that balance usability, aesthetics, development effort, and performance. I work to fixed price quotes for self-contained projects. --- The best live example of my work is Checkbot ( https://checkbot.io/ ), a browser extension that tests websites for SEO/speed/security problems. The entire project is my own work including coding the extension itself, UX/UI design, website design (the homepage is optimised to load in 0.7 seconds, 0.3MB data transferred), marketing, website copy, and website articles on web best practices. [ Rated 4.9/5, 80K+ active users, 100s of paying subscribers ] --- I have 10+ years of experience, including a PhD in software verification and 5+ years working for myself helping over 25 companies including Just Eat, Triumph Motorcycles and Fogbender (YC W22).

Email: bc@blaiseclarke.com Hi! I'm a computational scientist transitioning fully out of the wet lab into a purely software/data-focused role. My core strengths are in building/testing automated data pipelines. In my previous role, I developed a MATLAB codebase that analyzed neurophysiological data to identify multiple groups of clinical biomarkers in animal models. On my Github you can find a simplified version of this rebuilt using Python, Docker, Nextflow, and Pytest to visualize complex time-series data. Starting Georgia Tech's OMSCS program in January to deepen CS fundamentals. I'm looking for a full-time position within computational science, bioinformatics, QA automation/SDET, SRE, or types of Python-focused tech support/data analyst roles. I'm a quick learner and am really eager to pick up additional stacks and technologies. reply",

Maybe, principal or staff engineer, architect, CTO, co-founder, team/tech lead, head of engineering.. or very senior programmer..

Life-coaching too.. And making good friends along. But no office politics, plz. IMO The interesting part of making software, is the people, while technicals.. are solvable. And, Fun is important 4th factor in the Functionality-Quality-Deadlines Triangle. May relocate anywhere to stay with the team, once in a while, as IMO \"remote\" does not work well for knowledge/ culture/ relations -building activities. reply",

Email: ar9tech@outlook.com I am a systems software engineer specializing in low-level software design for backend systems. My professional experience spans multiple compiled languages, including Rust, C++, and Go. I have developed REST API servers, gRPC programs, and background job handlers/schedulers. In Rust, I have extensive hands-on experience building low-level applications using the Tokio runtime, applying strong principles of distributed systems, and working with synchronization primitives such as Mutexes, RwLocks, and concurrent data structures. I also focus on performance optimizations that leverage the language’s zero-cost abstractions and memory model. I place strong emphasis on building reliable test environments, using real-world testing methodologies such as unit tests, integration tests, concurrency stress tests, and fixture-based simulations. I have worked with clients across several domains, including: - Image processing - Blockchain network layer design - Cloud infrastructure solutions One of my most significant Rust projects was developing and deploying a web-based terminal access system for LXD containers running on bare-metal servers. This system leveraged Tokio for concurrency, TTYD for terminal emulation, and Caddy as the reverse proxy, with communication over Unix Domain Sockets. The solution also supported authentication. Efficient and scalable under configuration of environment. I love playing with distributed system a lot and challenging myself to learn new concepts under this domain. reply",

Until earlier this year, I worked at Uber as a Developer Advocate for Cadence — an open-source workflow orchestration engine powering 12B+ workflows/month. I partnered with dozens of teams to support adoption, scale distributed systems, and troubleshoot production issues. Cadence is a key component of Uber's Michelangelo ML platform, and I worked closely with AI/ML teams to integrate it into fault-tolerant pipelines. I also supported internal model training efforts, including fine-tuning LLMs to answer Cadence-related questions and building systems to classify and prioritize developer support. At DoorDash, I contributed to the migration from Django to Kotlin microservices on the Drive Merchant Services team, focusing on customer support endpoints. I also designed and implemented a modular refund rules engine for our largest partners, enabling flexible refund logic and supporting internal tooling. I’ve previously built NLP pipelines at Jobscan to match résumés to job descriptions and score resume strength, and earlier, trained models to predict ad performance based on copywriting—my first foray into ML back in 2016. After wrapping up at Uber, I took the summer off for personal restoration following a divorce. I'm now excited to return to a hands-on engineering role with a collaborative, technically strong team and a path toward engineering leadership (EM or CTO). I'm particularly interested in infrastructure, developer platforms, and applied ML systems in domains like healthcare, logistics, finance, or defense. Outside of work, I enjoy navigating Puget Sound on my sailboat, wrenching on my motorcycle, and getting curious about obscure systems and trivia. Let’s build something meaningful. reply",

          "text": "A few fun examples that I do as \"data analyst\" for the marketing department. 1. Writing my own graph/tree algorithms, so I can visualize traffic flows better than whatever Google offers, detecting key drop off points, bringing that to the relevant marketing people so they can come up with ways to combat it. 2. An email campaign needs to be sent out, but the key person that knew about it left. I dive in and realize the whole data source has been phased out. I go into the huge org I'm at, connect to the right people (my managers have no idea), get the access rights to the correct data source. The data engineer is on vacation, I dive into our Airflow project, look at how our dags are made, create my own dag + needed custom operators, and now the email campaign can be sent out, on time. 3. Someone asks me to research something with minimal information (regarding media spend and outcomes on that). So I go research it, turns out the conclusions are very sensitive. My colleague did the research before me and he looked at my conclusions and realized I came to the same realization. Together we come up with a strategy how to effectively communicate this such that these insights strenghten the marketing team. My analysis was a bit complex, so instead of creating a compelling visualization, I created a small plotly application (in a notebook) with the right visualization metaphores and right filters. 4. Programming small free apps that drive traffic, but are also useful app in their own right (think stuff like an advanced tax calculator, etc.). 5. Using Airflow, certain APIs for solid data and LLMs to optimize our SEO pages. The last step in the pipeline is an actual human reviewing it critically and editing the text. It saves them 80% of work. Currently collaborating on a project where we look at how LLMs can be a mini data analyst and retrieve data. My colleague got this project, but we realized it's better if we collaborate on it. reply",

You built something powerful. Early adopters get it. But broader adoption stalls because the experience doesn't create its own momentum. I specialize in that exact inflection point - making sophisticated tools feel like discovery rather than homework. My approach comes from 10 years running an indie game studio. I apply behavioral psychology to B2B/developer tools. Not gamification - actual intrinsic motivation that makes the 100th use rewarding. Judge for IGF, MagFest, CODiE, GEE, Serious Games awards. Recent work: Semantic analysis mapping 110M+ connections across 1.5M words. Previously: SpicyNodes (40M users), time.gov (pioneering govt web service), medical AI serving 1.5M patients. I lead teams or ship directly via AI-assisted architecture. Looking for Series A-C companies (10-50 people) with products that need to feel less like enterprise Java circa 2003.

I've worked on projects including LLMs, knowledge extraction, automotive part failure prediction, vehicle route planning in constrained environments, translation, maintenance optimization, automated sports highlights, maritime piracy, and more. Two things I would love to work on, feel free to ping me on these: - Offensive & defensive security. I've been working through some ideas for a while now  to apply AI (Not LLMs) to security. I think they could harden a network environment even in the presence of usable exploits against an active adversary. \n \n    - Executive memory and longer range functioning using LLM's.

          "text": "Location: Los Angeles Remote: Yes Relocation: Case-by-case I'm an early-stage CTO, expert engineer, and data professional interested in team-building, consulting and architecting data pipelines or API-heavy backends. At Edmunds.com, I worked on a fairly successful ad-tech product and my team bootstrapped a data pipeline using Spark, Databricks, and microservices built with Java, Python, and Scala. At ATTN:, I re-built an ETL Kubernetes stack, including data loaders and extractors that handle >10,000 API payload extractions daily. I created SOPs for managing data interoperability with Facebook Marketing, Facebook Graph, Instagram Graph, Google DFP, Salesforce, etc. More recently, I was the CTO and co-founder of a gaming startup. We raised over $6M and I was in charge of building out a team of over a dozen remote engineers and designers, with a breadth of experience ranging from Citibank, to Goldman Sachs, to Microsoft. I moved on, but retain significant equity and a board seat. I am also a minority owner of a coffee shop in northern Spain. That I'm a top-tier developer goes without saying. I'm interested in flexing my consulting muscle and can help with best practices, architecture, and hiring. Would love to connect even if it's just for networking!

The issue is less whether they're useful, and more, people just want to use ChatGPT, etc. Major AI providers gradually have consumed the use cases once reserved for bespoke apps. In search, consumers wanted to use Google, not your search engine; consumers want to use ChatGPT, not your bot. Since most companies are bad at building AI/agents (and search), user trust gravitates to a few known brands. Honestly this has been a pattern for decades in my domain (search) and it seems to extend to the AI space as well. You can be successful with positioning and expectation setting. Positioning to a niche. Expectation setting that you're not going to drive 10x company value by sprinking AI on it. But you can build something useful for a subset of users. Companies need to start with low ambitions, not big ones. You can also be successful just using AI for non-chat things. Enriching content or using LLMs in backend processes that aren't user-focused chat. reply",

The hold up for me has been that I’ve been unable to find a source of truth for what’s top-of-the-line as far as plugins are. With Neovim, it’s a safe bet to look at what folks like Folke are doing, but I have struggled to find a similar figure in the Emacs community who gives insight into what’s-what. I know Doom exists, but I want to fully “own” my config and not over complicate it.<p>Thanks!</p></p></div>",

While I do replace things all the time, I typically use multiple cursors (I do use bindings for that). If I need querying, I just type `M-x que RET` which gets picked up by a completion frameworks (in my case ivy).

As far as keeping up with whats latest and greatest, I think the real answer is there isn't a good online resource. There are emacs meetups and conferences and some are virtual, and you can ask around other power users and see what they are doing. I even find emacs packages to be pretty poor at selling themselves on why you should use them. As an example, Ivy and Counsel are kind of game changers to the UI, but I don't think you get any idea of that from their manual or main github page: https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper reply",

          "text": "I maintain a pretty popular Emacs starter-kit called Bedrock. [1] I suggest starting with it, or at least taking a look at it to get some ideas! Bedrock differs philosophically from Doom et al. in that Bedrock is meant to be as simple as possible . There's no magic, no extra package management system (looking at you Doom) to break or confuse. By default, it doesn't install any 3rd-party packages—it just sets better defaults. Recent versions of Emacs can do a lot, but the defaults are painfully outdated. Bedrock fixes that. It's basically a vanilla Emacs experience without some of the cruft carried over from the previous century. Bedrock also comes with a curated set of packages to enhance Emacs beyond better defaults. You can load these into your config as you begin to need them. List here: [2] If you are looking for a set of \"modern\" packages, this is it. I do pretty well keeping up in this space, and a lot of these (esp. Vertico, Consult, Corfu, etc.) seem to be accepted as the de-facto best replacements for older packages like Helm, Ivy, etc. (That said, I should add some config for Casual—very neat package to help with seldom-used features of Emacs.) Bedrock is meant to be understandable: clone it once, and then tweak from there. You'll find a lot of forks of Bedrock on GitHub as people have forked it and then built their own config on top. I'm working on updating Bedrock for Emacs 31. There won't really be that many changes, so like, don't wait for 31 to start your Emacs journey, but know that Bedrock is actively maintained and that the packages I've curated for it are the best I could possibly find. :) Oh, also, if you search \"best Emacs packages\", my blog post [3] will come up on the first page on basically every search engine I've tried. ;) Happy hacking!

Others' setups may be useful to check out, possibly pages of emacswiki.org, chatter on the #emacs IRC channel at libera.chat. Edit: As for heavily customized versions (Doom, spacemacs), I have not tried those myself, but occasionally saw people having issues with those, and others not being able to help them, since it was not clear what sort of magic is going on there.

From there I would pick and choose which packages I'm interested by going through the Systemcrafters's community [2] as others have mentioned and Reddit's r/emacs community. While Systemcrafters is a fun community I'm a bit reluctant to spend too much time there because it's more of a tinkering community than a day-to-day-usage focused community. Fine if you want to tinker all day with your config but not the best for getting work done. One thing I urge you to remember is that unlike neovim, Emacs isn't about just enabling and disabling plugins. Emacs is a Lisp environment. It really comes into its own when you program it. To that effect, I would read through the GNU Emacs info manual. Emacs ships with its manual in its inbuilt info reader and you can also find it in HTML [3] by GNU. Try not to think of your emacs as a constant soup of plugins and instead a codebase that you manage. The environment is very amenable to introspection, and there's inbuilt commands like `describe-key` and `describe-function` that pull up documentation for elisp. I'm a fan of the `helpful` package which I find to be a better version of `describe`.

Every time something annoyed me or I thought “there should be a package to do X”, I stopped what I was doing and went hunting… By doing it this way, you’re actually using it from the start and get to slowly taylor it to your personal needs.

It's similar to doom, in that it makes some decisions for you, but you can very much have a customized experience. I for instance have a lot of \"stock\" sections, and other things that are very customized that I've made myself. Look into the \"layers\" (sets of packages that work together). I'd particularly recommend checking out the compleseus layer, which is a composition of consult, orderless, vertico, and embark. They're all built to be composable (selection, pattern matching, selection interface, and context menu respectively), and they each add up to a brilliant emacs experience while reusing emacs' built-in frameworks (completing read). It's an alternative to helm and ivy (I've used each before). The reason I recommend spacemacs (I'm sure doom could be the same, I just didn't know it) is because it is an easy way to see what packages other people find useful and how to use them, and it has similar conventional across different packages (so you can run tests in the same way no matter whether you're using rust, or python or whatever other language). reply",

Vertico add incremental completion and present the candidates in a vertical list, so it’s more like filtering than completions. Consult provides a lot of collections for completions and some niceties on top of some existing completion sources. Two of its main features are narrowing (kinda like selectibg a subcollection) and asynchronous sources (you can have something like ripgrep powering the sources of completion candidates). reply",

Neither of the above is things I do more often than a handful of times a year. Meanwhile, terminal Emacs plays well with tmux and SSH which I do a lot of. For example, a workflow I have is to SSH to a Linux box, start a tmux session and have Emacs/ipython/jupyter with port forwarding open on the remote box.

I 99% of the time use emacs in a terminal. 90% of the time over ssh or in a non-GUI VM/docker etc. I usually install emacs-nox to speed up the install. Vanilla emacs is fine. Maximum I scp my .emacs file from another machine, but there's actually very little in it. Mostly it's disabling the menu bar, tool bar, and scroll bars. Usually all I'll do is adjust things such as indenting and other code formatting things to match the codebase I'm working on -- which varies from project to project anyway, and you need to do with any editor to avoid making a mess. I do have one little elisp function that tries to find and open the header file for the C file I'm  currently in, or the c, cc, cpp, c++ file for the header file I'm in.

This way you can easily do see what does what (by name) and have even more comments in the beginning of files. So even if you added some modification late at night/under influence of substances, you can still tell that you were thinking and easily switch it off or improve it.

So you split your main ~/.ssh/config file into smaller, reusable files stored in a subdirectory like ~/.ssh/config.d/. The main config file then \"includes\" (loads) these modular files automatically. So for instance, you might have: ~/.ssh/config.d/10-general.conf ~/.ssh/config.d/20-work.conf ~/.ssh/config.d/30-github.conf Can confirm this works great in teams or on multi-host setups, as it keeps things organized without cluttering a single massive config file and it works across tools like ssh, scp, rsync, etc. reply",

          "text": "I’ve rebuilt my emacs config a few times for exactly this reason! Some of the things I’ve found work well for me: - it’s pretty obvious, but it took me a while to figure it out: make your `~/.emacs.d` into a git (jj, hg, whatever) repo. You don’t need a remote but as you try things out it’s nice to be able to step back in time. - know what you want to build. For me I’m generally trying to make emacs do something that I’ve seen a colleague’s editor do: integrating language servers for source navigation; integrating a debug server for a nice visual debugging experience. - some people manage their emacs configuration as org-mode files. This is neat because you get an experience similar to Jupiter notebooks: you can intermix commentary and elisp. I haven’t ever gotten to this point but it looks neat when I see others do it. There are some good YouTube channels and blogs that talk about configuration, or that test different packages. I’ve found “Emacs from Scratch” and “Emacs Rocks” to be really useful. There’s a lot to customize and select from. Without steering you one way or another, here are some changes I’ve made recently or packages that I use: 1. For language servers, I find `lsp-mode` to be easier and more full-featured than `elgot`. 2. `dap-mode` plays nicely with `lsp-mode` and makes debugging straightforward. 3. I’ve tried, and use, a few different plugins for AI coding: `greger.el` is the first one I tried, but I’ve started using `xenodium/agent-shell` more. If you want to write (or hack on) an AI agent written in elisp, there’s `steveyegge/efrit`. 4. You’re probably accustomed to some sort of “tab completion” from neovim. Within emacs you’ll need to set up a “completion framework”; there’s a bunch to choose from. Watch some videos and experiment. You’ll probably find one that feels a lot like you’re used to (whether that’s completion-as-arrow-navigable-dropdown-at-cursor, or completion-in-side-panel, or whatever). Your muscle memory of how to move around in a document and how to tell your editor “I want to do something new now (see a list of open files, go to a new file, etc)” isn’t going to translate into emacs very well. It’s like shifting from a laptop keyboard to some weird split keyboard with thumb paddles: muscle memory won’t be satisfied, and you might just “not like” emacs due to that. There’s `evil.el` (“Emacs VI Layer”) which teaches emacs to recognize vim-style commands. I think vims have fantastic macro recording and replaying functionality - emacs has it as well, but making a recursive macro is harder for me, for some reason - and evil makes emacs’s macros feel on par with the vims. Another tripping hazard coming from a vim-like is that “undo” operates differently in emacs. I think the vims have a fairly linear undo: like a browser history back button. emacs stores an undo tree, which can lead to surprising behavior at first. If you’ve written or tweaked plugins for your editor and enjoy tinkering with your tools, then a vanilla greenfield approach to emacs will probably be very satisfying for you. If you want something that “just works” which you can experiment with and gradually learn more about over time, then you might get more mileage out of spacemacs. I think vim-style users tend to launch vim many many times through the day. cd here, edit a file; save, quit, edit the next file. emacs can act like an editor, but if you think of it as a highly customizable IDE, then you’ll get more use out of it. My uptime on emacs is generally measured in months, whereas for me vim is in seconds to minutes. I mention this because the startup time for emacs can be quite slow compared to vim; just don’t pay that cost over and over. reply",

Understandably, some people complain that it shouldn't need a tutorial or the defaults are bad. There's validity to that angle. There's also validity to Emacs pre-dating GUIs, the IBM keyboard, and the x86 instruction set. Once you get past the history of windows and killing, you can explore. The history is also super interesting! https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?EmacsHistory https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3386324 After you've read the tutorial, go wild. Try stuff out. Break things. Fix them. Learn your limits. Learn that there are very few limits imposed by Emacs itself. Hands down, the best resource for Emacs is Emacs itself. Especially, the Emacs manual and the Elisp manual. The \"An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp\" is also excellent if you're not familiar with Lisp. Learn to read Info files and learn the help system (basically C-h f and C-h v) https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/ Emacs really is a flagship of Freedom, with all its pain and glory. It lets you exist at the threshold of your zone of proximal development. Every bit you put into Emacs, you get a return on investment. Welcome to the Emacs community! It's full of weirdos and wizards, as well as regular folk. Stick around and I'm sure you'll make friends in no time. reply",

In an era where we're constantly into buying this and that, why don't we have a thread where we just talk about stuff we bought but regret buying?<p>I'll start:<p>- I got a 34\" ultrawide curved display. Philips, 34B2U5600C (3440x1440, 120Hz, USB-c and a lot of bells and whistles). It's just enormous, it takes half of my desk in depth and ~90% of my desk (130 cm) in width. Paid 400 Euros for that (new, off Amazon). It was cool at first but after a while it was feeling \"heavy\" on my desk. I kinda put it away and now I'm doing most of my work on \"just\" my 16-inches laptop display. It didn't really improve my life. Maybe I should have avoided the curved display. I'm torn between selling it and getting another one or selling it and keeping using just my laptop display.<p>- My ThinkPad X13G1. It just doesn't feel right. I bought it to replace my rusty X270. Supposedly it's much better (8c/16t+32GB ram vs 2c/8t+16gb ram on the X270) but it doesn't feel much snappier (same OS/Software) and battery life isn't that great either (the battery was in very good conditions when I received it). Also, when suspended the battery will drain incredibly quickly, sometimes overnight. Compared to my work macbook, it really feels like an inferior machine. Paid 400 Euros for that as well (used).</p></p></p></p></div>",

I wasn’t a fan of the default launcher, so I replaced it, and now it just feels like a silly Android tablet with a black and white screen that I don’t really have a use for. One of the big things (gimmicky) things that sold me on the pre-order was the fabric case in almost all the marketing photos. I thought it would be nice to have tech that wasn’t all plastic, metal, or glass… then it showed up as a plastic and glass slab and that case didn’t actually exist for sale. I was upset and should have retuned it, but thought I’d give it a chance since it is a new company. That was a mistake. It was something like $700, and I feel like it should be around $249. It’s got a bunch of buttons that don’t even do anything. I do like that the stylus doesn’t need to be charged, but that’s about it. I really wish Apple went this route on the Apple Pencil. reply",

          "text": "My X13G3 does not have such a setting in EFI setup but the fancy power management setups that come with most (if not all DEs) does not seem to play well with it, it seems to wait for some processes to finish before sleeping even though those processes have already been suspended and will not finish, so it never goes fully to sleep even though the laptop's lid LED says it is suspended. I never investigated this issue since I was just seeing how KDE and XFCE had progressed since my last try of them. Have not had any issues with it using old fashioned suspend setups with just a WM and no DE. Other things; it really did not play well with the 5.x LTS kernel of slackware 15, poor performance all around but switching to slackware current with its 6.x kernel solved that. KDE also used the GPU which decreased battery life but was still good, certainly better than the Windows that it came with which had abysmal battery life. I think the DEs also played with the CPU governor, at least with KDE, seem to recall that it reved up to full speed long before it needed to but don't quite remember. Overall, love the X13, especially the 16:10 screen ratio, but I think the G1s had a 16:9? Edit: With the DEs my X13 also goes into a half awake state when you plug it in when suspended. Generally not an issue but it will stay in that half suspended state until the lid is opened and then reclosed which means if you just unplug it and toss it into your bag, it is still in that half suspended state and will eat the battery. Another thing which I never investigated because I don't use DEs. reply",

On windows the CPU mitigations must be disabled or the integrated GPU runs hot.  Usage before: 83%, after 13%.  I still use win11 for some games for the anti-cheat crap. The mini-PCs are vulnerable to graphics errors in some video games that can perma-brick them.  Many people ran into this issue with Starfield and one specific multi-beam gun turning their mini-PC into a paper-weight. For cooling I get a desktop sized HEPA filter unit and remove the panel on the mini-pc that permits access to memory/nvme.  Enough air will get past the memory/storage sockets to cool the CPU. reply",

          "text": "The only thing I really miss at work after moving from Windows to macOS is AutoHotKey. I tried Hammerspoon. I thought having a more normal language (lua) would make it easier, but it felt more like fewer batteries were included, which made the ramp up seem steeper. Trivial things in AHK seemed like they needed a lot of extra supporting functions to enable it in HS. Some rose colored glasses could be involved here as well, as AHK had a lot of its own quirks I had to work around to make it reliable… but that was for robust code, not simple functionality. I also had a lot of downtime at work when first using AHK… time I didn’t have when I was trying to get HS going. I stopped using it while trying to diagnose some mouse/windowing issues I was having. It’s safe to say it wasn’t the problem, but I haven’t gone back to it. AppleScript exists, and JavaScript support has been added, but it seems like Apple doesn’t care much about it anymore. Shortcuts isn’t as powerful, and without an Apple ID (which I can’t have on my work Mac), I don’t think I can actually share or migrate anything I make, which makes it feel like a dead end. It’s also pretty slow. Automator also seems like it will be sunset at some point, in favor of Shortcuts. reply",
