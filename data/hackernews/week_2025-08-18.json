It is one of my weirdest web habits, on reflection. OTOH, back when del.icio.us was good, I used it for roughly the same purpose. These days, I still send links to Instapaper when they are essays or articles. I send links to Raindrop.io when they are anything else, basically anything the Instapaper text extractor would fail on. Things like repos, interactive charts/graphs, photographs, videos, etc. I still think it is behaving roughly as /dev/null. I do sometimes think that, at least nowadays, you can ask an LLM to visit your bookmarked links and do some semantic search over them.

It's really nice to open up a window or group of windows related to a project that I haven't touched in a few months and it just be one click. Plus, if I open up new tabs those also get saved for the next time. It also works for easily pulling up my regular work session so I don't need to manually open up the 8 or so tabs I always need in a workday.

I tend to have a similar approach but it sometimes results in keeping tabs open for along time, or dealing with a restore previous session everytime I start up. I keep bookmarks for specific things, sometimes ephemerally and sometimes to keep the link for reasearch, etc. Every so often I make a pass through a bunch of bookmarks and delete the ones that have rotted. Or try to point to an archive mirror if available. That process does a decent job getting rid of the junk. I do need to work on isolating my personal from my work reading when at home. I use different windows but I should be using different profiles or something. reply",

For “social” bookmarking, like delicious, I never really understood it, but I think sites like Reddit ended up filling that niche. My mental framework was always an evolution of forums, not bookmarking. For most things, I can do a search and get to something faster than going to my bookmaker. I use my standard browser bookmarks for my own little sites and things I go to multiple times every day. Then I have some others tucked away for cool sites that I think would be hard to find again. I then forget these exist and never visit, but when I remember they exist every 18 months or so, I go through them and they’re cool. reply",

          "text": "This post makes me realise I do, both in terms of browser bookmarks and in a more elaborate way in a similar read-it-later sense that other commenters have mentioned. I've not even thought of it as bookmarking until now though. First, I use regular bookmarks in Safari for pages I might visit \"often,\" i.e. more than once. This makes them immediately searchable in Alfred and really fast to open. Secondly, I use a multipronged Emacs system which allows me to easily file and sort links that I browse on a given day into an org-roam journal file. First, anything from Elfeed (rss reader) that I open or engage with gets logged. Second, I can save the currently open browser tab's URL with a keyboard shortcut. I've also mapped a 4 finger trackpad press to this which makes it super automatic and easy to do. I try doing this for everything I read and/or engage with, since I often find myself thinking \"what was that one thing,\" and this has helped me find it on multiple occasions now. Third, there's a dedicated way to capture the URL with a PROCESS todo state tag. All of these show up in my org agenda buffer which means I see them all the time and go through them every once in a while. Fourth, a dedicated shortcut (and trackpad 4 finger force press) both logs the page and sends it to Wallabag, which is a sort of self-hosted pocket alternative. This is synced with my Kobo ereader (with the Koreader operating system) and I tend to read through the interesting articles at a pace only slightly slower than they accumulate, so it tends to be manageable. For videos, I also have a quick docker service that allows me to yt-dlp a video, save it as mp3, and add it to an RSS feed for a podcast I host for myself, so I can listen to them on the go. In general I'm trying to separate the act of seeing a piece of media to engage with and consuming said piece of media. One notable benefit is that something that might have seemed interesting later turns out not to be. On the other hand, logging most things I engage with comes in handy a lot when I'm talking to someone and something I barely paid any mind to in the past comes up! In the future, I intend to expand the system with logging of the content as well as the URL, and adding embedding support with a vector database to allow for both full-text and semantic search. Retrievability is the biggest pain point right now (though ripgrep is already perfect for 80% of the usecases). Since it's all integrated with org-roam, I can also quickly \"promote\" links to full nodes, link them to other concepts, etc. This comes in super handy with quickly going through a lot of literature by following arXiv feeds via RSS. Having it all in one system is super handy. reply",

What made it special (2010-timeframe) was that we would do without thought what other companies struggled to do at that time (hot-hot failover, multi-region, \"3 machine minimum\" deployments), processing traffic for ~500M monthly users when spinning rust and 32gb of ram was considered \"a lot\". My perspective on what happened is reeeally smart people solved really tough problems, then would either bail to Google (and later FB) to write the \"v2.0\" and solve those same problems but \"better\" or they'd go and start a full-blown company to sell that solution. The tide rose around Yahoo! and both business-wise (and tech-wise), they didn't keep pace once their competitive advantage of \"we can scale\" dissipated. reply",

I probably spent a week or so, laying my concerns in group meetings, and trying to find the right data structure to do it.

At that time, around the beginning of 2008, there was a very clear division of labor between Java people and front end web people.  Java people had absolutely no idea how to write JavaScript.  It was so bad that Google wrote a tool called Google Web Toolkit (GWT) that automatically generated JavaScript from Java logic and it was beyond horrible, but there were some Java developers that really needed it. What I found most interesting about this excellent developer, and of course she was absolutely excellent at her job writing Java as well, was her secrecy.  She did not mean to reveal her ability to masterly address CSS and JavaScript concerns to me.  She did so because she knew I was super new and it didn't matter.  She did not reveal this to anybody else, because she didn't want to compensate for the repeated failures of people around her.  In hindsight I can absolutely see why she went out of her way to suppress her capabilities while at the office. reply",

Then on Monday, they'd reveal their work and it'd be something that seemed impossible last week. - Had deep understanding of the hardware so that diving in and writing some specific assembly-like (or literal assembly) code was part of their toolkit. - Were treated as a Goose That Laid The Golden Egg by management. Could do whatever they wanted, but they loved to work and code so it wasn't ever out of balance. - After a few years of working at the studio they started to have mental health issues because there was a never ending stream of needs and problems, many of which were solved with them. Planning projects started to include several technical miracles they would pull off. It started to be expected. Nowadays writing straight to the metal in video games is less common, so I think these types of guys have largely migrated to other fields. We used to write our own engines and there was more need for them. Now there's a lot more use of third party engines so there's less opportunity (and need). reply",

I'm also thinking, since my main goal here is for him to just learn, maybe we should even just start with basic math/science instead of straight into coding?<p>I don't have any kids myself, so I'm curious to learn how all of the parents on HN are educating their kids today!

I personally got hooked on AtCoder and Codeforces when I was in middle school. Back then, many contests started around 2 AM Japan time, which was tough, but it was incredibly fun. That experience is what led me to become a software engineer. This hasn't changed even in the AI era. I now have Claude Code write most of my code, and I don't spend nearly as much time actually writing code as I used to. However, the underlying data structures and algorithms still excite me immensely. There's something deeply satisfying about understanding the fundamental concepts and problem-solving techniques that no AI tool can replace. Competitive programming teaches you to think algorithmically and break down complex problems - skills that remain valuable whether you're writing code yourself or directing AI to do it for you. reply",

          "text": "Coding is meant to solve problems. And AI doesn’t know Jack about humans, only the breadcrumbs they leave on the internet. (Opinion) One idea is to pose problems at a high level and ask how one would solve them. A reference is Strategies forCreative Problem Solving, by Fogler and LeBlanc I recall an early day at work when I called the boss that I would be in late, running some numbers on the home computer (in Basic). They were tradeoffs using various ranges of variables. The alternative was the IBM 360, fat chance. He looked a bit angry when I sauntered in, but when I showed him the printout, he realized that I had done about a week’s worth of work. Basic is out the window now, but the point is to go from a problem to proposed solutions (TMTOWTDI) [0] and there may be more than one way. In fact, that might lead to a globally better solution than some local peak and certainly more instructive, as in proofs of Pythagoras’ Theorem. Through successive narrowing down, one finally gets to what AI does “best”, boilerplate, and by isolating its output, one can actually test the result with a smaller range of inputs. Okay, I am not, nor was I a professional coder. More a scripter and admin, tasked with solving problems in the quickest way. Perl did most of the heavy lifting. So, I am not griping on pro’s. The main thing I liked about perl, and groovy and python, which I didn’t need to use, was the existence of tested libraries. So, with groovy, I could access all the java libraries. No doubt the same for others. I have no idea how to impress this on others, since I think it’s way more trustworthy than black-box code, but I do recommend it. To what extent AI is going to reinvent the wheel on every coding request from it’s giant parts bin, I don’t know. I believe that the value is in translating problems and needs into potential solutions and finding or choosing a “best” one. Code blocks are a dime a dozen, or perhaps better put, 45+ cents a kilowatt. (In CA). It’s how you string them together that makes all the difference. A wheel for climbing stairs may be three-lobed or even legged [1]. A beginner is going to get no insight from black box output, IMO. More from documented examples and libraries. I learned a ton about perl from the rdb relational database by Hobbs, [2], reading through it and learning what was going on and how. It was open source, and has moved to github. Of course, you might suggest something newer than all of the above, but start simple, of course. I liked things like map() and such, as an alternative to looping, but that may be on the advanced side.

I started focusing on system design, organizational change strategy, cloud, and becoming more involved with how technology can be used to bring business value. I am not saying “learn cloud”.  That’s table stakes and not a differentiator.  I’m saying learn something well enough to be strategic and not just a ticket taker. If you look at the leveling guidelines of any tech company, you don’t get passed a mid level IC based on “I codez real gud”.  It’s based on scope, impact and dealing with ambiguity.  It might be phrased a different way.  But it all boils fish to that. reply",

It could be that my resume is too \"jumpy\", which is fair, but they could have read my resume before they wasted my time and theirs with three multi-hour interviews.<p>The only thing I can think of is that they just didn't like my personality during the interviews, which is honestly the most frustrating. If I had messed up the technical portion then that would be a goal to work towards by learning more technical stuff, but I'm not 100% sure what about my personality is screwing up these interviews, and even less sure on how I'm supposed to change anything about it.<p>It's hard to stay motivated but I guess I don't have much of a choice since I still need to pay my mortgage, so I was curious if anyone here had any advice on how to best tune my personality to do better in interviews? Preferably I'd prefer to stay honest (if for no other reason than I'm a pretty terrible liar).</p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Will be blunt since I imagine you're fed up and don't want affirmations. In the most common case where I see engineers who say they struggle with the soft skills parts of interviewing, the underlying issue is a lack of skill in communication - working out what's important, stating it clearly and concisely, and in a way appropriate to the audience. I read some of your blog and found it pleasantly chatty, well structured, and obviously technical. If you communicate like you do in writing, there is obviously no problem there. I have no doubt that your account of performing well on technical questions is correct. However... After some quick google searches, what I did find in your digital footprint is: - A relatively high number of online posts complaining about employers in general across several years - A tweet from a few years ago where you say you're fed up of software engineering but are forced to stick with it - (as you stated) a jumpy work history My best guess is that you're failing the digital footprint check. If I was hiring and post interview was doing a little more digging on candidates to help do a final pick, I would look at the short tenures, the outwardly directed frustration at employers, the stated lack of desire to be a software engineer at all, and pass on you. As for why this is happening after several technical interviews? Most likely that's when you undergo final background checks and get cut out of the process. If you are burned out, sick of workplace social narratives, and don't want to work as a software engineer, I sincerely empathise for you. However: don't let me, a random hacker news commenter, find that out in under 2 minutes of time spent on Google. reply",

Both did a good job and helped me feel a bit at ease. They both noticed that I worked at a place that later had a controversy and knew that I left prior to that but gave actionable ideas on how to answer questions around that during interviews or via linkedin.

We had been working together for two years.  But not in the same department.  I just started talking to her one day in the parking lot and she finally said “are you going to stop staring at me and ask for my number”. I was not thinking about dating at the time.  I had just come out of a bad situation less than a year earlier and I was trying to get my financial house in order - it was 2011 and I had made some bad real estate decisions before the housing crash and I was trying to get my career on track. I was happy with just hanging out with my long term female friends at the time and they provided all of the emotional and companionship needs I had with no complications.  My friends and I  traveled together, went out on “dates” (do you call it that when you are just doing date like things with no emotional or physical expectations?) etc. When I told my now wife  all I was going through it didn’t scare her away.  She was just as up front with me.  We were married seven months later.  15 years in, I still don’t feel like she kept anything from me that I didn’t know about her during the first two weeks and vice versa. This though is horrible general advice as far as dating.  I wasn’t pursuing her.  We knew of each other from work so I wasn’t a complete stranger and we were both in our mid 30s and divorced  then and she had two boys. I wasn’t in the headspace to seriously be in the “dating scene” then. I know how to small talk now and have studied conversational skills for my career.  If I were out there now, I would  do things differently. reply",

          "text": "I've rounded lots of sharp edges off my personality over the years, having been rejected a lot and having made unforced errors. The problem with advice here is that, if you're right and there's something personality-related and it's not just fierce competition or tiny sample size, we can't really tell through a post. I'm talking about the je ne sais quoi of you, the body language, the attitude, the unwritten vibe you give off, and posting videos here is uh, well, yeah, unlikely. So, I'd echo the advice of others to talk to your friends and ask them to give you feedback. Hopefully they're observant and willing to be blunt. I'll opine, though - have you tried a little masking and humility? I ask because if I had to guess based on probability, the archetype of the highly intelligent, technically excellent nerd tends to also run adjacent to underdeveloped social skills, or at least indifference to using them. Arrogance, defensiveness, ego abound. That's what I coach my team and friends on who have cracked this type of discussion open. If you were going to mask for an interview, coming across humble/hungry/smart (smart is probably not a problem for most here, but humble?...). Consider mirroring with the interviewer. Stay detached and practice this, especially when a finger is pointed at you or you don't ace a question, or they disagree. In all, it's probably the stuff you can't describe easily without being next to you. You may not even realize the signals you're putting off, if that is even what's going on. I know the struggle - my wife has been turned down over and over and over, and she takes it personally, but she's also going for jobs that clearly have tons of great applicants. Is it her attitude? Did she make a mistake bringing up that experience? Or maybe...or maybe it's just out of our control, and we have to stick to the plan and stay in the market. The losing move is not to play. reply",

I try not to do that during interviews.

There are so many internal reasons for not choosing to move forward with a candidate that have nothing to do with the candidate or their interview performance. The company's internal priorities and projects might have suddenly shifted. The headcount may no longer exist anymore. The hiring manager may have decided they really don't need another person after all. The job might not have existed in the first place and they're just fishing. The job might exist but they already know who they want and are doing throwaway interviews as a formality or for legal compliance reasons. Or they're just randomly rejecting candidates because they don't want to hire someone who is unlucky. No way to know for sure. reply",

There is also the existential crisis of AI taking our jobs as well hanging over us. It's pretty rough out there.

          "text": "Let me say first I understand the frustration you must be feeling right now. It's no fun to be under the gun with bills to pay and think you're getting turned down from jobs because of something that isn't even really the core of the work (at least that's my assumption). You don't have to be 100% sure about what it is personality-wise that you need to tune up to start making changes. You're an intelligent agent; your intuition is much better than random about things like this. I would say act on your intuitions about what specifically you are going that is rubbing them the wrong way, and be less like that - regress a little to the mean, in other words. This is generally good advice in the business world, even if it isn't good advice for e.g. becoming a celebrity on Twitter. Take note that most psychological studies suggest that personality is very unlikely to change dramatically in adulthood no matter what you do. It's better to focus on techniques that let you chill out for a few hours/days/weeks than it is to try to actually change who you are at core. reply",

Assuming it is you that is the problem, and working from that assumption is anything but natural for most people.  Even in your own thoughts.  Arrogance, defensiveness and a skewed sense of self are things most people tend to carry with them. I've read, listened to (audio book) and otherwise experienced a lot of leadership training in my life.

          "text": "So I like to use this metaphor (it was originally for dating but applies here too). Think of your body. Specifically how tall you are. You can't easily change your height. However, you can do the following: - workout - wear clothes that fit you and flatter your particular body type - etc The same applies to interviews. e.g. if you are a quiet, introverted person then there probably isn't much you can do if you are interviewing for a job that requires an outgoing personality like sales or event planning However, you can get better at rapport, asking questions and seeming interested and excited in the role. A lot of this is also how you respond to questions. For example, if someone asks \"Tell me about X\", X can be either vague or you are not sure why they are asking. If you respond with \"Well, I have a couple examples of X here they are: A, B, C. Which one would you like to hear about?\" then that shows you are both experienced and also good at clarifying what is being asked. One EXCELLENT way to practice this is to reach out to friends or family members who have done a lot of interviewing and have them do a mock interview. This is useful b/c they know both: - what hiring managers are looking for in general - you as a person and what may be \"the best side of you\" vs \"pretending to be something you're not\" I will also repeat what some other commenters have said: You are interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you. Much like a marriage, you want to partner with someone that \"fits\" with you and vice versa. In other words, reply",

There might be a middle ground between \"technical skills\" and \"personality\", though, which we do take into account, falling under \"soft skills\", which may be affected by certain personality traits. Things like polling the interviewer for their thoughts, asking thoughtful questions, being curious about the source of disagreement or misunderstanding, not being dogmatic, and so on. I think it can be harder to demonstrate these kinds of skills with certain personality types -- I used to be very nervous in interviews, and it wasn't always easy to have the presence of mind to exercise these soft skills. But even still, at least in technical interviews like programming or system design (as opposed to cross-functional/manager/tech leadership interviews), I've found it relatively rare for a candidate to be rejected for 'soft skill' failures when the right signals are there for technical strength. reply",

          "text": "I would counter, in that depending on the position(s) and candidate pool soft skills will make all the difference in the world when choosing between two technically sufficient candidates.  It may not even be a conscious bias, so much as, \"I'd rather work with this person.\" Most technical jobs can be done by most sufficiently skilled, or motivated candidates with enough intellect to handle the work.  Not always to a certain level of craft, efficiency or trend setting, but it's not about that to most business stakeholders.  I say this as someone who deeply cares about the craft, despite a rather insulting depiction, including some of my opinions and age I came across earlier today (grugbrain.dev). Likeability is hard, and even then striking a balance in a given context is also hard.  It often comes down to a level of self-reflection, which is where I think TFA is at right now.  Which is an attempt to establish a balance of personal responsibility, with \"culture fit.\"  Given that many of us have personality traits that tend to be deviations from the norm in many ways, it's all that more important to understand that in ourselves and our efforts to adapt to society. A pinnacle of this in Television is the show Dexter, where he regularly brings in doughnuts.  I've had coworkers that did similar, and it's impressive the amount of affect this has on the working environment and relationships in turn. Beyond this, comes the counter-intuitive position of being far more skilled than an interviewer.  This can definitely work against you at times as well for a number of reasons.  Just because you are the most technically adept for a position, doesn't mean you get the position.  The technical aspects of most jobs are more about a minimum of, can they do the job.

Mock interviews are a pretty good idea though. reply",

On topic: this job market is a complete circus and I wouldn't gleam any rejections as it having anything to do with any factor you can control. So many jobs just disappeared for me mid-interview, with a few ending up as ghosts after 4-5 rounds. There's interviews where I do well but it's clear they had someone else in the pipeline with double my experience. Recruiter disrespect is also at very high levels and you'll be rejected for reasons they cannot legally disclose. Then there's the whole outsourcing issue and how the interview never intended to hire you, even if you were the perfect candidate. Maybe one day we'll have a sane market again thst hires on the quality of the candidate. But that's not 2025. reply",

I don’t think I have low social intelligence in most cases, I have never had much issue making friends or anything like that.

          "text": "You are looking at this from your perspective, which is either pass or fail. From their perspective, they might be interviewing, say, six people.  As you say, they've already weeded out people from their resumes before they even get to the interview.  From my experience, and I have heard people note this before, interviews tend to be a Gaussian curve with a normal distribution.  People are weeded out by resumes and such.  However, if I interview six people, usually someone slips through the cracks who knows nothing or next to nothing.  That leaves the remaining five. Of the five, four are usually interchangeable.  They're like you - they get the technical questions right, or right enough.  It's obvious they've been writing features for code for a company like yours.  But of the five, often one person seems to not just know the easiest questions, or normal questions, but has a very good understanding of the subject matter.  You keep probing how much they know, and they have in-depth knowledge about a lot of things.  They know how registers on a processor work, they know about cache, they know the big O space of various algorithms, they can explain different approaches to concurrency in depth, or testing, or a lot of things.  So you got the answers right, they just did better. It could be something else - you might be just as good as someone else, but they were recommended by someone already on the team, or on an adjacent team, and they get brought in. I guess personalities are on a bell curve as well.  Maybe one out of six people fail on this.  Maybe they're disorganized, or immature, or arrogant.  Sometimes they miss basic social cues, or don't follow instructions, or even seem like they have a screw loose.  Then four out of six people seem nice enough - professional but friendly.  Then maybe one out of six just seems very sharp and smart, or avuncular, or what have you.  A lot of it ties together - someone who has done the work to learn a programming language more than the other candidates, you assume is going to be hard-working on features as well, and they also seem sharp because they know so much (about IT, but other things as well). Some things are contrasting.  The hard-working person who knows the programming language in and out, and who gets a lot of feature work done is probably willing  to sacrifice a little comity within the group to get a feature out.  On the other hand, some people are so stubborn and argumentative, their presence would be a negative, even if they have technical skills.  But some personality traits can contrast - I've working with friendly, supportive leads with great technical skills, but if they are a little bit hard charging this type of thing might be expected to come with the package of being very good technically. reply",

So unlike training where you need to have memory coherence over something like 100k machines and somehow avoid the certainty of machine failure, you just need to route mostly small amounts of data to a bunch of big machines. I don't know what the specs of their inference machines are, but where I worked the machines research used were all 8gpu monsters. so long as your model fitted in (combined) vram, you could job was a goodun. To scale the secret ingredient was industrial amounts of cash. Sure we had DGXs (fun fact, nvidia sent literal gold plated DGX machines) but they wernt dense, and were very expensive. Most large companies have robust RPC, and orchestration, which means the hard part isn't routing the message, its making the model fit in the boxes you have.

The key advantage of doing batched inference at a huge scale is that once you maximize parallelism and sharding, your model parameters and the memory bandwidth associated with them are essentially free (since at any given moment they're being shared among a huge amount of requests!), you \"only\" pay for the request-specific raw compute and the memory storage+bandwidth for the activations.  And the proprietary models are now huge , highly-quantized extreme-MoE models where the former factor (model size) is huge and the latter (request-specific compute) has been correspondingly minimized - and where it hasn't, you're definitely paying \"pro\" pricing for it.  I think this goes a long way towards explaining how inference at scale can work better than locally. (There are \"tricks\" you could do locally to try and compete with this setup, such as storing model parameters on disk and accessing them via mmap, at least when doing token gen on CPU.  But of course you're paying for that with increased latency, which you may or may not be okay with in that context.) reply",

But! even if its larger, Your bottleneck isn't the network, its waiting on the GPUs to be free[1].

There's an argument that if compute was the dominant term that Google would never have been anything but leading by a lot. Personally right now I see one clear leader and one group going 0-99 like a five sigma cosmic ray: Anthropic and the PRC. But this is because I believe/know that all the benchmarks are gamed as hell, its like asking if a movie star had cosmetic surgery. On quality, Opus 4 is 15x the cost and sold out / backordered. Qwen 3 is arguably in next place. In both of those cases, extreme quality expert labeling at scale (assisted by the tool) seems to be the secret sauce. Which is how it would play out if history is any guide: when compute as a scaling lever starts to flatten, you expert label like its 1987 and claim its compute and algorithms until the government wises up and stops treating your success persobally as a national security priority. It's the easiest trillion Xi Xianping ever made: pretending to think LLMs are AGI too, fast following for pennies on the dollar, and propping up a stock market bubble to go with the fentanyl crisis? 9-D chess.

A big part is simply a massive number of matrix FMA units to process enormous matrix operations, which comprises the bulk of doing a forward pass through a model. Caching enhancements and massively growing memory was necessary to facilitate transformers, but on the hardware side not a huge amount has changed and the fundamentals from years ago still powers the latest models. The hardware is just getting faster and with more memory and more parallel processing units. And later getting more data types to enable hardware-enabled quantization. So it isn't like Google designed a TPU for a specific model or architecture. They're pretty general purpose in a narrow field (oxymoron, but you get the point). The set of operations Google designed into a TPU is very similar to what nvidia did, and it's about as broadly capable. But Google owns the IP and doesn't pay the premium and gets to design for their own specific needs. reply",

          "text": "I think the problem I see with this type of response is that it doesn't take into context the waste of resources involved.  If the 700M users per week is legitimate then my question to you is: how many of those invocations are worth the cost of resources that are spent, in the name of things that are truly productive? And if AI was truly the holy grail that it's being sold as then there wouldn't be 700M users per week wasting all of these resources as heavily as we are because generative AI would have already solved for something better.  It really does seem like these platforms are, and won't be, anywhere as useful as they're continuously claimed to be. Just like Tesla FSD, we keep hearing about a \"breakaway\" model and the broken record of AGI.  Instead of getting anything exceptionally better we seem to be getting models  tuned for benchmarks and only marginal improvements. I really try to limit what I'm using an LLM for these days.  And not simply because of the resource pigs they are, but because it's also often a time sink.  I spent an hour today testing out GPT-5 and asking it about a specific problem I was solving for using only 2 well documented technologies.  After that hour it had hallucinated about a half dozen assumptions that were completely incorrect. One so obvious that I couldn't understand how it had gotten it so wrong. This particular technology, by default, consumes raw SSE. But GPT-5, even after telling it that it was wrong, continued to give me examples that were in a lot of ways worse and kept resorting to telling me to validate my server responses were JSON formatted in a particularly odd way. Instead of continuing to waste my time correcting the  model I just went back to reading the docs and GitHub issues to figure out the problem I was solving for.  And that led me down a dark chain of thought: so what happens when the \"teaching\" mode rethinks history, or math fundamentals? I'm sure a lot of people think ChatGPT is incredibly useful. And a lot of people are bought into not wanting to miss the boat, especially those who don't have any clue to how it works and what it takes to execute any given prompt.  I actually think LLMs have a trajectory that will be similar to social media.  The curve is different and I, hopefully, don't think we've seen the most useful aspects of it come to fruition as of yet. But I do think that if OpenAI is serving 700M users per week then, once again, we are the product.  Because if AI could actually displace workers en masse today you wouldn't have access to it for $20/month. And they wouldn't offer it to you at 50% off for the next 3 months when you go to hit the cancel button. In fact, if it could do most of the things executives are claiming then you wouldn't have access to it at all. But, again, the users are the product - in very much the same way social media played into. Finally, I'd surmise that of those 700M weekly users less than 10%  of those sessions are being used for anything productive that you've mentioned and I'd place a high wager that the 10% is wildly conservative.  I could be wrong, but again - we'd know about that if it were the actual truth. reply",

We know a few things: LLMs are not efficient, LLMs are consuming more water than traditional compute, we know the providers know but they haven't shared any tangible metrics, and the build process involves, also, an exceptional amount of time, wattage and water.

That's 14 LOC per minute . Compared to industry norms of 50-150 LOC per 8 hour day . Apparently,this \"hot-shot\" is not \"naive\", though, implying that it's most definitely legit.

As a result, I get 30-40% more done, and a bigger proportion of it is higher value work. And, AI sometimes helps me with stuff that I -can't- do, like making a good illustration of something.

          "text": "Reading your two comments in conjunction - I find your take reasonable, so I apologise for jumping the gun and going knee first in my previous comment. It was early where I was, but should be no excuse. I feel like if you're going to go down the route of the energy consumption needed to sustain the entire human organism, you have to do that on the other side as well - as the actual activation cost of human neurons and articulating fingers to operate a keyboard won't be in that range - but you went for the low ball so I'm not going to argue that, as you didn't argue some of the other stuff that sustains humans. But I will argue the wider implication of your comment that a like-for-like comparison is easy - it's not, so leaving it in the neuron activation space energy cost would probably be simpler to calculate, and there you'd arrive at a smaller ChatGPT ratio. More like 10-20, as opposed to 100-200. I will concede to you that economies of scale mean that there's an energy efficiency in sustaining a ChatGPT workforce compared to a human workforce, if we really want to go full dystopian, but that there's also outsized energy inefficiency in needing the industry and using the materials to construct a ChatGPT workforce large enough to sustain the economies of scale, compared to humans which we kind of have and are stuck with. There is a wider point that ChatGPT is less autonomous than an assistant, as no matter the tenure with it, you'll not give it the level of autonomy that a human assistant would have as it would self correct to a level where you'd be comfortable with that. So you need a human at the wheel, which will spend some of that human brain power and finger articulation, so you have to add that to the scale of the ChatGPT workflow energy cost. Having said all that - you make a good point with MoE - but the router activation is inefficient; and the experts are still outsized to the processing required to do the task at hand - but what I argue is that this will get better with further distillation, specialisation and better routing however only for economically viable task pathways. I think we agree on this, reading between the lines. I would argue though (but this is an assumption, I haven't seen data on neuron activation at task level) that for writing a command-line tool, the neurons still have to activate in a sufficiently large manner to parse a natural language input, abstract it and construct formal language output that will pass the parsers. So you would be spending a higher range of energy than for an average Chat GPT task In the end - you seem to agree with me that the current unit economics are unsustainable, and we'll need three processes to make them sustainable - cost going up, efficiency going up and usefulness going up. Unless usefulness goes up radically (which it won't due to scaling limitations of LLM's), full autonomy won't be possible, so the value of the additional labour will need to be very marginal to a human, which - given the scaling laws of GPU's - doesn't seem likely. Meanwhile - we're telling the masses at large to get on with the programme, without considering that maybe for some classes of tasks it just won't be economically viable; which creates lock in and might be difficult disentangle in the future. All because we must maintain the vibes that this technology is more powerful than it actually is. And that frustrates me, because there's plenty pathways where it's obvious it will be viable, and instead of doubling down on those, we insist on generalisability. reply",

IDK.  I didn't give human entry level employees that much autonomy.  ChatGPT runs off and does things for a minute or two consuming thousands and thousands of tokens, which is a lot like letting someone junior spin for several hours. Indeed, the cost is so low -- better to let it \"see its vision through\" than to interrupt it.  A lot of the reason why I'd manage junior employees closely are to A) contain costs, and B) prevent discouragement.  Neither of those apply here. (And, you know -- getting the thing back while I remember exactly what I asked and still have some context to rapidly interpret the result-- this is qualitatively different from getting back work from a junior employee hours later). > that maybe for some classes of tasks it just won't be economically viable; Running an LLM is expensive.  But it's expensive in the sense \"serving a human costs about the same as a long distance phone call in the 90's.\"  And the vast majority of businesses did not worry about what they were expending on long distance too much . And the cost can be expected to decrease, even though the price will go up from \"free.\"  I don't expect it will go up too high; some players will have advantages from scale and special sauce to make things more efficient, but it's looking like the barriers to entry are not that substantial. reply",

The ability to produce enough food for those in need already exists, so that problem is theoretically solved.  Granted, logistics engineering[0] is a real thing and would benefit from \"our best and brightest.\" What is lacking most recently, based on empirical observation, is a commitment to benefiting those in need without expectation of remuneration.

      "title": "Ask HN: Does Microsoft gain anything from the constant annoying rebranding?",
      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I know no company or business in history that had the amount of rebranding that Microsoft did, initially I thought that the product manager there might have had an identity crisis, and he/she will be leave the position at some point and this it will be over. But this practice does not seem to end ever, which made me wonder if it is a company policy and it actually helps the business growth. Does any one of you know any possible business use to such intensive rebranding?<p>Some of you might have not dealt with many Microsoft products so you might have not experienced examples of what I am talking about, so to name a few:<p><pre><code>   * Azure Active Directory → Microsoft Entra ID (maybe the most horrible one of them)\n   * Microsoft Threat Protection → Microsoft 365 Defender\n   * Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection → Microsoft Defender for Endpoint\n   * Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection → Microsoft Defender for Office 365\n   * Azure Advanced Threat Protection → Microsoft Defender for Identity\n</code></pre>\nOffice products recently:<p><pre><code>  * Office 365 Basic for Business is renamed to Microsoft 365 Apps for business\n  * Office 365 Standard for Business is renamed to Microsoft 365 Business Basics\n  * Office 365 Premium for Business is renamed to Microsoft 365 Business Standard\n  * Some other tier was then renamed to be Microsoft 365 Business Premium\n</code></pre>\nOther insane rebranding: \n  * Microsoft Remote Desktop  -&gt; Windows App (???!)\n  * Outlook for windows -&gt; Outlook Classic<p>And the entire Office things after the Microsoft 365 rebranding, is now being rebranded again as Microsoft Copilot 365<p>Some other products do not even make any sense, like Windows OneDrive that not the same as the OneDrive you get with Office/Microsoft 365. Some other products have extremely confusing naming; XBox, Xbox360, Xbox One, Xbox One S/X, Xbox Series X/S. I can’t stop thinking that someone intentionally choose them to be that confusing, no way their review cycle could not have noticed any of that.<p>Another example that might be familiar for the hacker community is .NET (which is a bad name initially but disregarding that) The new name for the open source version of the .NET Framework was called “.NET Core”, back then at work we used to refer to old projects that used .NET (the closed source one) as “.NET Projects” and the new ones as  “.NET Core” projects, then Microsoft decided to drop the “Core” (which was, again, a bad name initially), and referred internally to projects that used the old framework as .NET Framework projects, so now we have two frameworks, one called the “.NET” framework and other called the “.NET Framework” framework.<p>Thankfully I no longer have to deal with a lot of Microsoft products at work, but when I have to, I’m just astonished by how much things that are just literally the same of how I left them are having totally different names, I found out lately that a team had set up a “ubiquitous language” set that they agreed to use internally to refer to the MS products they are using to avoid confusing.<p>Again, my question, is there any sane reason why Microsoft keeps this insane rebranding policy? Is making people confused all the time actually help their marketing strategy and growth?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Instead of working on hyper-optimization of things like better ad targeting in search of more growth, we're working on more important problems and lifting bigger weights. More startups means better compensation for ICs and innovators. Rewards for capital risk rather than extremely large wealth funds and pension plans. Look at your Fords and Boeings. Totally stagnant.

But that creates hurdles. I was trying to interact with the Trunk project the other day. But they required me to create accounts on multiple services just to get in the game. When you need a Github account and a Discord account and... You know what? Nevermind. It's too much effort just to be nice and inform you of an issue with your project. I totally understand that putting a public email address out there creates a huge burden for them. I suppose if I value a product enough I will accept some smaller burden and take the load off them. But most of the time I don't value a product enough to allow the authors to offload their burden onto me.

So, Gitea was forked from Gogs to allow it to take a different direction, with a larger group of maintainers and more input from the user community. There were two major attempts to have hosted Gitea. The first was Codeberg, a nonprofit based in the EU. The second is a business that took the name Gitea, is based in the US, and changed Gitea (the software) to the \"open core, closed premium\" model.

First, don't break the back button. I started the project right around the time github broke too many critical features in short succession. The back button, the URL bar, and ctrl+f in the code view. I also want it to be easy to use as a federated collaboration tool. Ideally you'd start your own instance locally, get a familiar GitHub like interface for submitting patches anywhere, even by email. Or if you're hosting a project, you could have an always up instance that others could connect to. The part I've been thinking about deeply the past few days is how to improve the discoverability of peer repos and forks. I want to create something github like in terms of collaboration, but also try to incorporate some of the best lessons from mailing list based repos where it's easy to grab and try patchsets (exposed as branches) from a 'fork' without losing the value of a cannon 'upstream' and without insisting that any specific upstream is where every single commit belongs. The whole thing is written in zig without any dependencies other than git for some of the repo management features I haven't ported yet. (and for generating git blames) If you do use it, or notice any issues, or think it's missing features do let me know. I'm currently trying to decide which is the next most important thing to hack on :) see also https://github.com/GrayHatter/srctree if you want to subscribe to updates (still a feature srctree lacks lol) reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I recently came across a comment [0] here that highlighted the challenges of building native desktop apps with LLMs. The commenter pointed out how scarce training resources have become—few blog posts, tutorials, or open-source projects exist compared to web or mobile development. They also noted that while desktop app development was a solid career path in the 90s, it's now seen as a dead end for most, outside of big players like Microsoft or Adobe.<p>This got me thinking: My own experience with desktop development dates back to the late 90s using Turbo Pascal 6 in Delphi, and I'm out of the loop on modern practices. With the evolving landscape, I'm curious about what tools and workflows developers are actually using today.<p>Some questions to spark discussion:<p>- What programming languages and frameworks are popular for desktop apps?\n- Are there any go-to IDEs, build tools, or libraries that make development easier?\n- Do the above answers change if you care about code performance or efficiency (whatever that means to you)?\n- Is native desktop app development still viable as a career, or are most greenfield projects shifting to web-based alternatives?<p>I'd love to hear from folks with recent experience—success stories, pitfalls, and recommendations would be great. Thanks in advance for sharing!<p>[0] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44841291\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44841291</a></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Sorry for taking so long to respond...I was out on vacation! The general strategy is to figure out what state needs to be stored in your app, and combine that into one div in the page that can be grabbed via something like  innerHTML. For a gallery app that is viewing pictures on copyparty, that will be the metadata, like the URL of the image, the tags you want to apply and/or what category it is in, the index within the album, the date info, etc. Then, when your page loads, you can load all that and reason about how to arrange your photos, what to display, etc.  Once that's done, the URLs can be swapped in to generate the appropriate view.  I would give some thought to how to leverage WebDAV to create a directory that can store e.g. thumbnails.  Copyparty does that itself, but your app should likely have its own disk-based cache accessible from a folder served by Copyparty. The self-save part is mostly creating a something like a clone function that knows how to clone the static parts and inject updated sections for the data. I've written a little about about how to do this in my post years ago about a TiddlyWiki saver written for jart's Cosmopolitan. https://rpdillon.net/redbean-tiddlywiki-saver.html I've iterated on it quite a bit since then, and haven't updated my site accordingly. It's probably worth documenting the progress I've made since. reply",

          "text": "I have been evaluating and testing the Filesystem API for a local first web based CAD editor and having direct r/w access to the filesystem is a great way to make such a thing, couple with the FilesystemObserver[1] API this makes building proper editors on the web a breeze. In place of this, Firefox recommends using the origin private file system (OPFS)[2] which is basically a sandboxed filesystem that the users cannot access. Though I agree from a security perspective it kind of makes sense (not particularly for my usecase), but it removes the ability for the user to have realtime changes on local files. An example of this is using the web based tool as an intermediary step or a processing step in a bigger pipeline; I save it using my web tool and then native applications automatically handle file updates.\nThis just creates an extra step for Firefox/Safari to replicate changes locally by having to manually update local files. Also neither Firefox nor Safari support showDirectoryPicker() which also creates blocks for building a web based editor. I love Firefox and I hope they can add support for this. I have stopped caring about Safari/Webkit completely because it's hellish to try and maintain feature parity while NOT sacrificing innovation and ease of use.

          "text": "At work we use C#, .Net, and WPF.  I've only used it at this company, and I can't say for sure if my dislikes are with WPF, or how our codebase is using it.  Overall it's not terrible, except for being proprietary and Windows only. Outside of work, I'm out in left field using Common Lisp for most of my projects, so I'm not sure how helfpul this is, but... In the past, I used Qt4 because there was an amazing Common Lisp binding and it worked well on Linux, FreeBSD and OSX.  It's increasingly hard to use Qt4 any more, though, and changes in the Qt project made the technique used by the Qt4 bindings impractical for Qt5 or Qt6 - at least that was my understanding when I looked into it. For newer things I've tried LTK but don't really like the looks of it and I wouldn't say it's \"modern\".  It seems to work across platform well enough, though, and for simple stuff it's okay. More often than not I'm using a combination of the Slime tools in Emacs in combination with an GLFW/OpenGL window.  Often I'll use the inspector to display data and make changes that show up in an OpenGL window, or run some commands in the REPL and pop up an image in an external viewer or load something in a browser.  It only works for certain types of applications, and I won't even pretend it's practical for end users, but it works pretty well, and it's flexible as a developer. I'm curious to see what other people say.  It's been a while since I madea full blown GUI application. reply",

          "text": "Topping my list of GUI toolkit requirements are cross-platform and native look & feel. As far as I know, Qt still beats everything else in these areas on the desktop. It's mostly excellent. However, I find The Qt Group's commercial licensing (and their tactics as reported by various people on HN) a little scary. If I were to go commercial, I think I would stick with LGPL Qt and link dynamically or give customers my object files for re-linking, because I get the impression that accepting a commercial Qt license could restrict my ability to use open-source Qt elsewhere. I suppose there might be some other way to safely navigate those waters, but from what I've read, The Qt Group has a reputation for making this far from hassle-free. It's not an immediate problem because I currently use Qt only for open-source and personal tools. I have grown tired of C++, so I've been using Python to drive Qt. The bindings are very good, mirroring the C++ API so closely that I just use the C++ docs when I need to look something up. I've also been watching for Qt bindings to other compiled languages, mainly for distributing non-Linux GUI apps more simply than Python allows. Such bindings often turn out to expose only Qt Quick, which lacks functionality that I sometimes need, but there are a few that expose Qt Widgets. For example, these Go bindings: https://github.com/mappu/miqt I hope we'll eventually see a cross-platform GUI toolkit rivaling Qt in a language more pleasant than C++ (and ideally easier to bind to other languages). The one being developed for internal use by the Zed editor has some promising ideas about how to render native-looking text, which I think is a good start: https://zed.dev/blog/videogame https://www.gpui.rs/ reply",

It's not just a single hermetically sealed box. This part comes from one supplier, this part from another. Both can be modified, and require different skills to modify. 2. You start from day 1 to take baby steps in thinking about whom to trust. Here there are 2 separate projects that would be very hard to collude together.

          "text": "There's a GUI library: https://github.com/flamendless/Slab In general, if you use a minority platform you have to assume it has a tiny minority testing it and so budget for there to be more bugs and so on. LÖVE itself is rock solid, but programs built on it may not be. So I try to minimize the number of layers of libraries I add atop it. So far that has meant I found it easier to just draw my own UI in all my programs.[1] I've only played with Slab a little bit myself. If you use Slab, please do report bugs. I've done that in the past when I've used it. That's what it takes to make a minority platform more stable. [1] Drawing all my own UI also keeps my download sizes small. For example, https://akkartik.itch.io/carousel is 400KB. If you take out 4 fonts and the extensive online help, the code itself is only 100KB. By comparison, Slab seems to be almost 1MB of code. But that's just me. I care a lot about being easy to download on slow internet connections, and less code seems more hackable. But I give up some creature comforts, and reasonable people will disagree with me about the value of a UI library. reply",

The project I am currently building is a software infra for building E2EE applications, and it requires a little bit of everything - mobile apps for key management, desktop/cli apps/client libraries for actually encrypting data, sometimes a web based app, and a zero trust backend. Using Xamarin/MAUI for mobile apps, Blazor WASM for Web, Blazor Hybrid / MAUI / Avalonia UI for Desktop. All of the frameworks have their quirks, so it may take a bit of time to learn your patterns, build your base classes, but after that you pretty much enjoy the productivity of a modern high level language. - What programming languages and frameworks are popular for desktop apps?\n- for me - Blazor Hybrid / MAUI / Avalonia UI / WinForms - Are there any go-to IDEs, build tools, or libraries that make development easier?\n- I use MSVS 2022, VSCode for .NET, IntelliJ for $$$ at work. There are of course UI control libraries, I am using MudBlazor for Blazor WASM / Hybrid, other than that I use built-in controls that come with each framework. I try to use as little as possible of 3rd party libraries b/c my apps are security-sensitive. - Do the above answers change if you care about code performance or efficiency (whatever that means to you)? \n- in my case no, I am able to find what I need in .NET ecosystem. Modern .NET supports ahead-of-time compilation compiling to native code, and that helps to reduce start-up time which is important for Desktop / CLI. Ironically, for a long running processes, like a web service, the just-in-time compilation sometimes produces code running faster than ahead-of-time compilation, b/c it learns most common execution paths at runtime, and is able to recompile on the fly, optimizing for most frequent execution paths, giving a non-trivial performance boost in some cases - Is native desktop app development still viable as a career, or are most greenfield projects shifting to web-based alternatives\n- depends on the app/use case. For my project, desktop is the first class citizen, but I am building E2EE apps, i.e. end-to-end-encryption apps, aka client-side encryption, and native / Desktop / CLI is a better fit for E2EE in most of the cases compared to web apps. For those Web apps that I have it is still E2EE but in the browser (still client side encryption) reply",

Once your codebase reaches the size needed to solve actual business problems, the quality of the output varies wildly, the complexity of the prompts required to produce useful code increases, and the output code requires significant editing to actually integrate without bugs or errors. My personal opinion is that for vibe coding to be viable as the complexity of feature requirements or the size of the code base increase, the specificity and complexity of the input prompt will eventually demand more from the engineer than just writing the code, since code is more specific by definition than natural language. reply",

          "text": "My stack lately has been Next.js with Prettier and very strict lint, type, and complexity gates, plus opinionated tests that aim for real signal over mere coverage theatre. I want to find the time to fine-tune GPT-4o using before/after examples of code that fails the gates and then passes them. The hope being it generates gate-compliant code on the first try much more often, which is cheaper and more reliable than relying on a base model with brute-force retries. I think this might also align with research showing that grounding models in execution feedback yields order-of-magnitude gains in sample efficiency and improved code quality, not just speed [0][1].

          "text": "My comment is more about what to expect in the next 12 months. I've been using VSCode's Copilot with Claude Sonnet 4 and find it to be terrifyingly competent running 8 hours a day costing ~$10. I am developing techniques to keep it moving forward producing code and fast. First, prompt engineering like \"write clean, simple, and elegant code.\" Second, I use TypeScript script very strictly which helps. Third, the models are amazing at producing very simple test units which will be important in the fifth. Fourth, I use techniques like \"look for opportunities to refactor pure functions in the file and put them at the top of file\" or \"look for opportunities to refactor pure function and put them in shared utils.ts file.\" Fifth, every hour or so, I will have the agent simplify and clean the code and with complete test coverage both unit and integration as longs as they all pass .... good to go. This is a process and it is the same every time. So now I'm thinking about how do I write code to automate these steps into an automated process. For example, I keep using the same pattern of steps to solve hard debugging problems which I'm going to leave out of this conversation now. If I can create a process in code, I'd be one step closer to complete automation coding. The patterns are emerging. I strongly believe in 12 months these systems are going to be able to write extremely complicated programs with very little input from the human in the loop. reply",

Just like you said, they all claim to make $xk per month and have a course to sign up for. I really hate this as places like product hunt are just gummed up now with Slapps (AI slop apps).

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">In the last 2-3 years, I have noticed an <i>aggressive</i> increase in censorship on western platforms like Reddit, StackExchange (History, Politics, Skeptics etc.), 9gag etc. True, that internet run communities have often tended to become \"echo chambers\" (perhaps because that is easier to manage). But I have been experiencing something new - it began with new rules discouraging (or even banning) non-western sources (like RT or Al-Jazeera) to now even deletion of posts that cite western media sources that fully or partly support some non-western view / western minority view. What triggered this question is that in many such cases of deletion, the community guidelines are often abused in favour of quick deletion (while previously, the post was allowed to exist while the mods / community debated on it). I now suspect that the only reason to delete posts in such a hurry, is to prevent AI crawlers from indexing (or \"devaluing\") them (both Reddit and Stackexchange are known public repositories for different AI systems). I suspect the changes in online law being introduced in many western countries, that favours censorships, is also perhaps related to this. Am I mistaken here?</div>",

These days, I still send links to Instapaper when they are essays or articles. I send links to Raindrop.io when they are anything else, basically anything the Instapaper text extractor would fail on. Things like repos, interactive charts/graphs, photographs, videos, etc. I still think it is behaving roughly as /dev/null.

I started using it mainly to be able to save an open window to return to a project, and it ended up replacing my bookmarks. My issue with bookmarks was always the friction of managing them, but for whatever reason it fits my mental model to organize by open windows. It's really nice to open up a window or group of windows related to a project that I haven't touched in a few months and it just be one click. Plus, if I open up new tabs those also get saved for the next time. It also works for easily pulling up my regular work session so I don't need to manually open up the 8 or so tabs I always need in a workday. Something toaybe check out if you already organize open windows by task or project. [0] https://tab-session-manager.sienori.com/ reply",

I tend to have a similar approach but it sometimes results in keeping tabs open for along time, or dealing with a restore previous session everytime I start up. I keep bookmarks for specific things, sometimes ephemerally and sometimes to keep the link for reasearch, etc. Every so often I make a pass through a bunch of bookmarks and delete the ones that have rotted.

For “social” bookmarking, like delicious, I never really understood it, but I think sites like Reddit ended up filling that niche. My mental framework was always an evolution of forums, not bookmarking. For most things, I can do a search and get to something faster than going to my bookmaker. I use my standard browser bookmarks for my own little sites and things I go to multiple times every day. Then I have some others tucked away for cool sites that I think would be hard to find again. I then forget these exist and never visit, but when I remember they exist every 18 months or so, I go through them and they’re cool. reply",

What made it special (2010-timeframe) was that we would do without thought what other companies struggled to do at that time (hot-hot failover, multi-region, \"3 machine minimum\" deployments), processing traffic for ~500M monthly users when spinning rust and 32gb of ram was considered \"a lot\". My perspective on what happened is reeeally smart people solved really tough problems, then would either bail to Google (and later FB) to write the \"v2.0\" and solve those same problems but \"better\" or they'd go and start a full-blown company to sell that solution. The tide rose around Yahoo! and both business-wise (and tech-wise), they didn't keep pace once their competitive advantage of \"we can scale\" dissipated. reply",

I tried though to stay mostly self directed and self reliant when solving the problem or task the group had given me. I eventually got stuck trying to figure out how to reassemble IP fragments into a whole packet. I probably spent a week or so, laying my concerns in group meetings, and trying to find the right data structure to do it. Then one day, he gives me freestanding C code that was superbly written, with some macros for benchmarking, etc. For the most part it worked but needed some massaging for edge cases and such, but it was so beautiful and solved my immediate needs. I was unblocked but the whole ordeal has since been imprinted in my mind. He didn't give any context when handing the code, but I later figured out he implemented the algorithm as described in RFC 815. Deep in the annals of history and literature in networking that isn't really covered by any contemporary networking text books or sources. Anyways now that I'm a mentor/tech lead these days, I'm always looking for my opportunity to help unblock someone by writing some very specific hard to implement code. reply",

At that time, around the beginning of 2008, there was a very clear division of labor between Java people and front end web people.  Java people had absolutely no idea how to write JavaScript.  It was so bad that Google wrote a tool called Google Web Toolkit (GWT) that automatically generated JavaScript from Java logic and it was beyond horrible, but there were some Java developers that really needed it. What I found most interesting about this excellent developer, and of course she was absolutely excellent at her job writing Java as well, was her secrecy.  She did not mean to reveal her ability to masterly address CSS and JavaScript concerns to me.  She did so because she knew I was super new and it didn't matter.  She did not reveal this to anybody else, because she didn't want to compensate for the repeated failures of people around her.  In hindsight I can absolutely see why she went out of her way to suppress her capabilities while at the office. reply",

Then on Monday, they'd reveal their work and it'd be something that seemed impossible last week. - Had deep understanding of the hardware so that diving in and writing some specific assembly-like (or literal assembly) code was part of their toolkit. - Were treated as a Goose That Laid The Golden Egg by management. Could do whatever they wanted, but they loved to work and code so it wasn't ever out of balance. - After a few years of working at the studio they started to have mental health issues because there was a never ending stream of needs and problems, many of which were solved with them. Planning projects started to include several technical miracles they would pull off. It started to be expected. Nowadays writing straight to the metal in video games is less common, so I think these types of guys have largely migrated to other fields.

So unlike training where you need to have memory coherence over something like 100k machines and somehow avoid the certainty of machine failure, you just need to route mostly small amounts of data to a bunch of big machines. I don't know what the specs of their inference machines are, but where I worked the machines research used were all 8gpu monsters. so long as your model fitted in (combined) vram, you could job was a goodun. To scale the secret ingredient was industrial amounts of cash. Sure we had DGXs (fun fact, nvidia sent literal gold plated DGX machines) but they wernt dense, and were very expensive. Most large companies have robust RPC, and orchestration, which means the hard part isn't routing the message, its making the model fit in the boxes you have.

The key advantage of doing batched inference at a huge scale is that once you maximize parallelism and sharding, your model parameters and the memory bandwidth associated with them are essentially free (since at any given moment they're being shared among a huge amount of requests!), you \"only\" pay for the request-specific raw compute and the memory storage+bandwidth for the activations.  And the proprietary models are now huge , highly-quantized extreme-MoE models where the former factor (model size) is huge and the latter (request-specific compute) has been correspondingly minimized - and where it hasn't, you're definitely paying \"pro\" pricing for it.  I think this goes a long way towards explaining how inference at scale can work better than locally. (There are \"tricks\" you could do locally to try and compete with this setup, such as storing model parameters on disk and accessing them via mmap, at least when doing token gen on CPU.  But of course you're paying for that with increased latency, which you may or may not be okay with in that context.) reply",

If the requests were regularly spaced, and they certainly won’t be, but for the sake of argument, then 1 machine could serve 17,000 requests per day, or 120,000 per week. At that rate, you’d need about 5,600 machines to serve 700M requests. That’s a lot to me, but not to someone who owns a data center. Yes, those 700M users will issue more than 1 query per week and they won’t be evenly spaced. However, I’d bet most of those queries will take well under 1 second to answer, and I’d also bet each machine can handle more than one at a time.

There's an argument that if compute was the dominant term that Google would never have been anything but leading by a lot. Personally right now I see one clear leader and one group going 0-99 like a five sigma cosmic ray: Anthropic and the PRC. But this is because I believe/know that all the benchmarks are gamed as hell, its like asking if a movie star had cosmetic surgery. On quality, Opus 4 is 15x the cost and sold out / backordered. Qwen 3 is arguably in next place. In both of those cases, extreme quality expert labeling at scale (assisted by the tool) seems to be the secret sauce. Which is how it would play out if history is any guide: when compute as a scaling lever starts to flatten, you expert label like its 1987 and claim its compute and algorithms until the government wises up and stops treating your success persobally as a national security priority. It's the easiest trillion Xi Xianping ever made: pretending to think LLMs are AGI too, fast following for pennies on the dollar, and propping up a stock market bubble to go with the fentanyl crisis? 9-D chess. It's what I would do about AI if I were China. Time will tell. reply",

          "text": "TPUs are accelerators that accelerate the common operations found in neural nets. A big part is simply a massive number of matrix FMA units to process enormous matrix operations, which comprises the bulk of doing a forward pass through a model. Caching enhancements and massively growing memory was necessary to facilitate transformers, but on the hardware side not a huge amount has changed and the fundamentals from years ago still powers the latest models. The hardware is just getting faster and with more memory and more parallel processing units. And later getting more data types to enable hardware-enabled quantization. So it isn't like Google designed a TPU for a specific model or architecture. They're pretty general purpose in a narrow field (oxymoron, but you get the point). The set of operations Google designed into a TPU is very similar to what nvidia did, and it's about as broadly capable. But Google owns the IP and doesn't pay the premium and gets to design for their own specific needs. reply",

You can see a bit of that in the gif on the front page of the book. https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/ I also see how sometimes bad choices by me can make things inefficient. Luckily for me if my code/models are running slow I can ping colleagues who are able to debug at both a depth and speed that is quite incredible.

          "text": "I think the problem I see with this type of response is that it doesn't take into context the waste of resources involved.  If the 700M users per week is legitimate then my question to you is: how many of those invocations are worth the cost of resources that are spent, in the name of things that are truly productive? And if AI was truly the holy grail that it's being sold as then there wouldn't be 700M users per week wasting all of these resources as heavily as we are because generative AI would have already solved for something better.  It really does seem like these platforms are, and won't be, anywhere as useful as they're continuously claimed to be. Just like Tesla FSD, we keep hearing about a \"breakaway\" model and the broken record of AGI.  Instead of getting anything exceptionally better we seem to be getting models  tuned for benchmarks and only marginal improvements. I really try to limit what I'm using an LLM for these days.  And not simply because of the resource pigs they are, but because it's also often a time sink.  I spent an hour today testing out GPT-5 and asking it about a specific problem I was solving for using only 2 well documented technologies.  After that hour it had hallucinated about a half dozen assumptions that were completely incorrect. One so obvious that I couldn't understand how it had gotten it so wrong. This particular technology, by default, consumes raw SSE. But GPT-5, even after telling it that it was wrong, continued to give me examples that were in a lot of ways worse and kept resorting to telling me to validate my server responses were JSON formatted in a particularly odd way. Instead of continuing to waste my time correcting the  model I just went back to reading the docs and GitHub issues to figure out the problem I was solving for.  And that led me down a dark chain of thought: so what happens when the \"teaching\" mode rethinks history, or math fundamentals? I'm sure a lot of people think ChatGPT is incredibly useful. And a lot of people are bought into not wanting to miss the boat, especially those who don't have any clue to how it works and what it takes to execute any given prompt.  I actually think LLMs have a trajectory that will be similar to social media.  The curve is different and I, hopefully, don't think we've seen the most useful aspects of it come to fruition as of yet. But I do think that if OpenAI is serving 700M users per week then, once again, we are the product.  Because if AI could actually displace workers en masse today you wouldn't have access to it for $20/month. And they wouldn't offer it to you at 50% off for the next 3 months when you go to hit the cancel button. In fact, if it could do most of the things executives are claiming then you wouldn't have access to it at all. But, again, the users are the product - in very much the same way social media played into. Finally, I'd surmise that of those 700M weekly users less than 10%  of those sessions are being used for anything productive that you've mentioned and I'd place a high wager that the 10% is wildly conservative.  I could be wrong, but again - we'd know about that if it were the actual truth. reply",

We know a few things: LLMs are not efficient, LLMs are consuming more water than traditional compute, we know the providers know but they haven't shared any tangible metrics, and the build process involves, also, an exceptional amount of time, wattage and water. For me it's: if you have access to a supercomputer do you use it to tell you a joke or work on a life saving medicine?

Honestly, it probably does these tasks better than I would (not better than I could , but you can't give maximum effort on everything).  As a result, I get 30-40% more done, and a bigger proportion of it is higher value work. And, AI sometimes helps me with stuff that I -can't- do, like making a good illustration of something.

          "text": "Reading your two comments in conjunction - I find your take reasonable, so I apologise for jumping the gun and going knee first in my previous comment. It was early where I was, but should be no excuse. I feel like if you're going to go down the route of the energy consumption needed to sustain the entire human organism, you have to do that on the other side as well - as the actual activation cost of human neurons and articulating fingers to operate a keyboard won't be in that range - but you went for the low ball so I'm not going to argue that, as you didn't argue some of the other stuff that sustains humans. But I will argue the wider implication of your comment that a like-for-like comparison is easy - it's not, so leaving it in the neuron activation space energy cost would probably be simpler to calculate, and there you'd arrive at a smaller ChatGPT ratio. More like 10-20, as opposed to 100-200. I will concede to you that economies of scale mean that there's an energy efficiency in sustaining a ChatGPT workforce compared to a human workforce, if we really want to go full dystopian, but that there's also outsized energy inefficiency in needing the industry and using the materials to construct a ChatGPT workforce large enough to sustain the economies of scale, compared to humans which we kind of have and are stuck with. There is a wider point that ChatGPT is less autonomous than an assistant, as no matter the tenure with it, you'll not give it the level of autonomy that a human assistant would have as it would self correct to a level where you'd be comfortable with that. So you need a human at the wheel, which will spend some of that human brain power and finger articulation, so you have to add that to the scale of the ChatGPT workflow energy cost. Having said all that - you make a good point with MoE - but the router activation is inefficient; and the experts are still outsized to the processing required to do the task at hand - but what I argue is that this will get better with further distillation, specialisation and better routing however only for economically viable task pathways. I think we agree on this, reading between the lines. I would argue though (but this is an assumption, I haven't seen data on neuron activation at task level) that for writing a command-line tool, the neurons still have to activate in a sufficiently large manner to parse a natural language input, abstract it and construct formal language output that will pass the parsers. So you would be spending a higher range of energy than for an average Chat GPT task In the end - you seem to agree with me that the current unit economics are unsustainable, and we'll need three processes to make them sustainable - cost going up, efficiency going up and usefulness going up. Unless usefulness goes up radically (which it won't due to scaling limitations of LLM's), full autonomy won't be possible, so the value of the additional labour will need to be very marginal to a human, which - given the scaling laws of GPU's - doesn't seem likely. Meanwhile - we're telling the masses at large to get on with the programme, without considering that maybe for some classes of tasks it just won't be economically viable; which creates lock in and might be difficult disentangle in the future. All because we must maintain the vibes that this technology is more powerful than it actually is. And that frustrates me, because there's plenty pathways where it's obvious it will be viable, and instead of doubling down on those, we insist on generalisability. reply",

IDK.  I didn't give human entry level employees that much autonomy.  ChatGPT runs off and does things for a minute or two consuming thousands and thousands of tokens, which is a lot like letting someone junior spin for several hours. Indeed, the cost is so low -- better to let it \"see its vision through\" than to interrupt it.  A lot of the reason why I'd manage junior employees closely are to A) contain costs, and B) prevent discouragement.  Neither of those apply here. (And, you know -- getting the thing back while I remember exactly what I asked and still have some context to rapidly interpret the result-- this is qualitatively different from getting back work from a junior employee hours later). > that maybe for some classes of tasks it just won't be economically viable; Running an LLM is expensive.  But it's expensive in the sense \"serving a human costs about the same as a long distance phone call in the 90's.\"  And the vast majority of businesses did not worry about what they were expending on long distance too much . And the cost can be expected to decrease, even though the price will go up from \"free.\"  I don't expect it will go up too high; some players will have advantages from scale and special sauce to make things more efficient, but it's looking like the barriers to entry are not that substantial. reply",

The person attempting to learn either (hopefully) figures out the AI model was wrong, or sadly learns the wrong material. The level of impact is probably quite relative to how useful the knowledge is one's life. The good or bad news, depending on how you look at it, is that humans are already great at rewriting history and believing wrong facts, so I am not entirely sure an LLM can do that much worse.

And I'll meet with him once per week to check up onhim.<p>My dilemma is that AI has completely changed how I personally code(and learn things), and all of the existing courses/curriculums for kids just feel a bit archaic...<p>Obviously, I can't just tell my nephew to go talk to chatgpt all day long and learn, without a project plan/target, he's gonna drift off(as I would too). I'm also thinking, since my main goal here is for him to just learn, maybe we should even just start with basic math/science instead of straight into coding?<p>I don't have any kids myself, so I'm curious to learn how all of the parents on HN are educating their kids today!

          "text": "First thing I'd say is to figure out if the kid has real interest and willingness to learn programming/computers at all. If you want to find motivation, figure out what topic/hobby the kid is interested in, and code together something useful/fun/inspiring in that domain. After all, all real world programs are used for some specific domain. Second thing is the young age of 11 (of course depends on invividual). \"Real\" programming requires understanding very abstract concepts (like memory, objects, functions, variables, loops, program state/execution model etc.). I remember when I was young (maybe ~13 yo), and I struggled alone with C++ and Delphi. I could copy and paste some code, but I couldn't really understand what make them work (or didn't). Of course it was different time then (no youtube tutorials, no AI, no good quality open source stuff etc.). Third thing, if the kid is interested to learn, is good environment/language to start with. I'd start with plain vanilla HTML5 (HTML + CSS + JS). It's relatively easy to get feedback and interactivity with it, and it runs on every computer and mobile device. And the whole program - content (HTML), layout (CSS) and interactivity (JS) - can be in a single file and \"recompiled\" just by clicking refresh button. I wouldn't use any JS frameworks, because then it becomes learning something else than real basics. With couple of lines JS, you can draw graphics, play sounds based on keyboard/mouse/touch interactivity etc. But of course, even if its just handful of HTML5 APIs, to teach someone why/how they work is a big task. Fourth thing, now with AI, for many, learning seems to have become a process of collecting random factoids here and there, and then trying to make some sense of the whole mess. I'd say a great book that presents an overview of a topic from start to end is overly underrated at this point of time. When book(s) stops giving lessons, use LLM(s)/professional(s). When LLM(s)/professional(s) stops giving you lessons, you are at the frontier of knowledge, and you have to figure it out yourself by teaching yourself :) reply",

Each lesson taught them one small part they could use towards their final challenge to build a car they could navigate a maze with in the shortest time. They were paired up in teams of two.

I personally got hooked on AtCoder and Codeforces when I was in middle school. Back then, many contests started around 2 AM Japan time, which was tough, but it was incredibly fun. That experience is what led me to become a software engineer. This hasn't changed even in the AI era. I now have Claude Code write most of my code, and I don't spend nearly as much time actually writing code as I used to. However, the underlying data structures and algorithms still excite me immensely. There's something deeply satisfying about understanding the fundamental concepts and problem-solving techniques that no AI tool can replace.

          "text": "Coding is meant to solve problems. And AI doesn’t know Jack about humans, only the breadcrumbs they leave on the internet. (Opinion) One idea is to pose problems at a high level and ask how one would solve them. A reference is Strategies forCreative Problem Solving, by Fogler and LeBlanc I recall an early day at work when I called the boss that I would be in late, running some numbers on the home computer (in Basic). They were tradeoffs using various ranges of variables. The alternative was the IBM 360, fat chance. He looked a bit angry when I sauntered in, but when I showed him the printout, he realized that I had done about a week’s worth of work. Basic is out the window now, but the point is to go from a problem to proposed solutions (TMTOWTDI) [0] and there may be more than one way. In fact, that might lead to a globally better solution than some local peak and certainly more instructive, as in proofs of Pythagoras’ Theorem. Through successive narrowing down, one finally gets to what AI does “best”, boilerplate, and by isolating its output, one can actually test the result with a smaller range of inputs. Okay, I am not, nor was I a professional coder. More a scripter and admin, tasked with solving problems in the quickest way. Perl did most of the heavy lifting. So, I am not griping on pro’s. The main thing I liked about perl, and groovy and python, which I didn’t need to use, was the existence of tested libraries. So, with groovy, I could access all the java libraries. No doubt the same for others. I have no idea how to impress this on others, since I think it’s way more trustworthy than black-box code, but I do recommend it. To what extent AI is going to reinvent the wheel on every coding request from it’s giant parts bin, I don’t know. I believe that the value is in translating problems and needs into potential solutions and finding or choosing a “best” one. Code blocks are a dime a dozen, or perhaps better put, 45+ cents a kilowatt. (In CA). It’s how you string them together that makes all the difference. A wheel for climbing stairs may be three-lobed or even legged [1]. A beginner is going to get no insight from black box output, IMO. More from documented examples and libraries. I learned a ton about perl from the rdb relational database by Hobbs, [2], reading through it and learning what was going on and how. It was open source, and has moved to github. Of course, you might suggest something newer than all of the above, but start simple, of course. I liked things like map() and such, as an alternative to looping, but that may be on the advanced side.

The only thing missing is the menu bar. Xfce is not my favourite but I can customize it which is reason enough. reply",

I still think that the i3 way of managing windows is amazing, but I actually rarely needed lots of windows in the same workspace tiled.

It could be that my resume is too \"jumpy\", which is fair, but they could have read my resume before they wasted my time and theirs with three multi-hour interviews.<p>The only thing I can think of is that they just didn't like my personality during the interviews, which is honestly the most frustrating. If I had messed up the technical portion then that would be a goal to work towards by learning more technical stuff, but I'm not 100% sure what about my personality is screwing up these interviews, and even less sure on how I'm supposed to change anything about it.<p>It's hard to stay motivated but I guess I don't have much of a choice since I still need to pay my mortgage, so I was curious if anyone here had any advice on how to best tune my personality to do better in interviews? Preferably I'd prefer to stay honest (if for no other reason than I'm a pretty terrible liar).</p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Will be blunt since I imagine you're fed up and don't want affirmations. In the most common case where I see engineers who say they struggle with the soft skills parts of interviewing, the underlying issue is a lack of skill in communication - working out what's important, stating it clearly and concisely, and in a way appropriate to the audience. I read some of your blog and found it pleasantly chatty, well structured, and obviously technical. If you communicate like you do in writing, there is obviously no problem there. I have no doubt that your account of performing well on technical questions is correct. However... After some quick google searches, what I did find in your digital footprint is: - A relatively high number of online posts complaining about employers in general across several years - A tweet from a few years ago where you say you're fed up of software engineering but are forced to stick with it - (as you stated) a jumpy work history My best guess is that you're failing the digital footprint check. If I was hiring and post interview was doing a little more digging on candidates to help do a final pick, I would look at the short tenures, the outwardly directed frustration at employers, the stated lack of desire to be a software engineer at all, and pass on you. As for why this is happening after several technical interviews? Most likely that's when you undergo final background checks and get cut out of the process. If you are burned out, sick of workplace social narratives, and don't want to work as a software engineer, I sincerely empathise for you. However: don't let me, a random hacker news commenter, find that out in under 2 minutes of time spent on Google. reply",

          "text": "Really appreciate seeing comments like this on HN. You got me thinking about my own presence online. I decided to use gpt-5-thinking and perplexity's deep research with the same prompt to deep dive on my legal name, find aliases, research those aliases, etc. Then report on positive and negatives findings. Both did a good job and helped me feel a bit at ease. They both noticed that I worked at a place that later had a controversy and knew that I left prior to that but gave actionable ideas on how to answer questions around that during interviews or via linkedin.  I think I might set up a perplexity task to run and email this once a month. I'll probably one seperate ones for my own handles that are not attached to my name to monitor them as well. The panopticon never sleeps. reply",

It's impossible to know how many jobs I've been turned down for due to my online presence and edgy takes; most of my takes really aren't that edgy or even that out there, but they might be enough make a potential employer think twice.

Everyone has bad days where they're frustrated about something and could write something a bit cynical in the process.  I don't think that's reflective of their entire personality.

I am a customer facing consultant in rooms with decision makers, I aired all of my dirty laundry with my now wife because I didn’t want to waste my time or hers. We had been working together for two years.  But not in the same department.  I just started talking to her one day in the parking lot and she finally said “are you going to stop staring at me and ask for my number”. I was not thinking about dating at the time.  I had just come out of a bad situation less than a year earlier and I was trying to get my financial house in order - it was 2011 and I had made some bad real estate decisions before the housing crash and I was trying to get my career on track. I was happy with just hanging out with my long term female friends at the time and they provided all of the emotional and companionship needs I had with no complications.  My friends and I  traveled together, went out on “dates” (do you call it that when you are just doing date like things with no emotional or physical expectations?) etc. When I told my now wife  all I was going through it didn’t scare her away.  She was just as up front with me.  We were married seven months later.  15 years in, I still don’t feel like she kept anything from me that I didn’t know about her during the first two weeks and vice versa. This though is horrible general advice as far as dating.  I wasn’t pursuing her.  We knew of each other from work so I wasn’t a complete stranger and we were both in our mid 30s and divorced  then and she had two boys. I wasn’t in the headspace to seriously be in the “dating scene” then. I know how to small talk now and have studied conversational skills for my career.  If I were out there now, I would  do things differently. reply",

          "text": "I've rounded lots of sharp edges off my personality over the years, having been rejected a lot and having made unforced errors. The problem with advice here is that, if you're right and there's something personality-related and it's not just fierce competition or tiny sample size, we can't really tell through a post. I'm talking about the je ne sais quoi of you, the body language, the attitude, the unwritten vibe you give off, and posting videos here is uh, well, yeah, unlikely. So, I'd echo the advice of others to talk to your friends and ask them to give you feedback. Hopefully they're observant and willing to be blunt. I'll opine, though - have you tried a little masking and humility? I ask because if I had to guess based on probability, the archetype of the highly intelligent, technically excellent nerd tends to also run adjacent to underdeveloped social skills, or at least indifference to using them. Arrogance, defensiveness, ego abound. That's what I coach my team and friends on who have cracked this type of discussion open. If you were going to mask for an interview, coming across humble/hungry/smart (smart is probably not a problem for most here, but humble?...). Consider mirroring with the interviewer. Stay detached and practice this, especially when a finger is pointed at you or you don't ace a question, or they disagree. In all, it's probably the stuff you can't describe easily without being next to you. You may not even realize the signals you're putting off, if that is even what's going on. I know the struggle - my wife has been turned down over and over and over, and she takes it personally, but she's also going for jobs that clearly have tons of great applicants. Is it her attitude? Did she make a mistake bringing up that experience? Or maybe...or maybe it's just out of our control, and we have to stick to the plan and stay in the market. The losing move is not to play. reply",

I try not to do that during interviews.

The hiring manager may have decided they really don't need another person after all. The job might not have existed in the first place and they're just fishing.

It's no fun to be under the gun with bills to pay and think you're getting turned down from jobs because of something that isn't even really the core of the work (at least that's my assumption). You don't have to be 100% sure about what it is personality-wise that you need to tune up to start making changes. You're an intelligent agent; your intuition is much better than random about things like this. I would say act on your intuitions about what specifically you are going that is rubbing them the wrong way, and be less like that - regress a little to the mean, in other words. This is generally good advice in the business world, even if it isn't good advice for e.g. becoming a celebrity on Twitter. Take note that most psychological studies suggest that personality is very unlikely to change dramatically in adulthood no matter what you do. It's better to focus on techniques that let you chill out for a few hours/days/weeks than it is to try to actually change who you are at core. reply",

However, you can do the following: - workout - wear clothes that fit you and flatter your particular body type - etc The same applies to interviews. e.g. if you are a quiet, introverted person then there probably isn't much you can do if you are interviewing for a job that requires an outgoing personality like sales or event planning However, you can get better at rapport, asking questions and seeming interested and excited in the role. A lot of this is also how you respond to questions. For example, if someone asks \"Tell me about X\", X can be either vague or you are not sure why they are asking. If you respond with \"Well, I have a couple examples of X here they are: A, B, C. Which one would you like to hear about?\" then that shows you are both experienced and also good at clarifying what is being asked. One EXCELLENT way to practice this is to reach out to friends or family members who have done a lot of interviewing and have them do a mock interview. This is useful b/c they know both: - what hiring managers are looking for in general - you as a person and what may be \"the best side of you\" vs \"pretending to be something you're not\" I will also repeat what some other commenters have said: You are interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you.

Things like polling the interviewer for their thoughts, asking thoughtful questions, being curious about the source of disagreement or misunderstanding, not being dogmatic, and so on. I think it can be harder to demonstrate these kinds of skills with certain personality types -- I used to be very nervous in interviews, and it wasn't always easy to have the presence of mind to exercise these soft skills. But even still, at least in technical interviews like programming or system design (as opposed to cross-functional/manager/tech leadership interviews), I've found it relatively rare for a candidate to be rejected for 'soft skill' failures when the right signals are there for technical strength. reply",

          "text": "I would counter, in that depending on the position(s) and candidate pool soft skills will make all the difference in the world when choosing between two technically sufficient candidates.  It may not even be a conscious bias, so much as, \"I'd rather work with this person.\" Most technical jobs can be done by most sufficiently skilled, or motivated candidates with enough intellect to handle the work.  Not always to a certain level of craft, efficiency or trend setting, but it's not about that to most business stakeholders.  I say this as someone who deeply cares about the craft, despite a rather insulting depiction, including some of my opinions and age I came across earlier today (grugbrain.dev). Likeability is hard, and even then striking a balance in a given context is also hard.  It often comes down to a level of self-reflection, which is where I think TFA is at right now.  Which is an attempt to establish a balance of personal responsibility, with \"culture fit.\"  Given that many of us have personality traits that tend to be deviations from the norm in many ways, it's all that more important to understand that in ourselves and our efforts to adapt to society. A pinnacle of this in Television is the show Dexter, where he regularly brings in doughnuts.  I've had coworkers that did similar, and it's impressive the amount of affect this has on the working environment and relationships in turn. Beyond this, comes the counter-intuitive position of being far more skilled than an interviewer.  This can definitely work against you at times as well for a number of reasons.  Just because you are the most technically adept for a position, doesn't mean you get the position.  The technical aspects of most jobs are more about a minimum of, can they do the job.

I also didn't do a mock interview with ChatGPT right before it, and believe that lack of warmup did me in.

There's interviews where I do well but it's clear they had someone else in the pipeline with double my experience. Recruiter disrespect is also at very high levels and you'll be rejected for reasons they cannot legally disclose. Then there's the whole outsourcing issue and how the interview never intended to hire you, even if you were the perfect candidate.

I had one mock interviewer (paid) tell me I wasn't explaining my solutions enough and I needed to take charge of the conversation more. Invest some time into finding out what your real weaknesses are. reply",

          "text": "You are looking at this from your perspective, which is either pass or fail. From their perspective, they might be interviewing, say, six people.  As you say, they've already weeded out people from their resumes before they even get to the interview.  From my experience, and I have heard people note this before, interviews tend to be a Gaussian curve with a normal distribution.  People are weeded out by resumes and such.  However, if I interview six people, usually someone slips through the cracks who knows nothing or next to nothing.  That leaves the remaining five. Of the five, four are usually interchangeable.  They're like you - they get the technical questions right, or right enough.  It's obvious they've been writing features for code for a company like yours.  But of the five, often one person seems to not just know the easiest questions, or normal questions, but has a very good understanding of the subject matter.  You keep probing how much they know, and they have in-depth knowledge about a lot of things.  They know how registers on a processor work, they know about cache, they know the big O space of various algorithms, they can explain different approaches to concurrency in depth, or testing, or a lot of things.  So you got the answers right, they just did better. It could be something else - you might be just as good as someone else, but they were recommended by someone already on the team, or on an adjacent team, and they get brought in. I guess personalities are on a bell curve as well.  Maybe one out of six people fail on this.  Maybe they're disorganized, or immature, or arrogant.  Sometimes they miss basic social cues, or don't follow instructions, or even seem like they have a screw loose.  Then four out of six people seem nice enough - professional but friendly.  Then maybe one out of six just seems very sharp and smart, or avuncular, or what have you.  A lot of it ties together - someone who has done the work to learn a programming language more than the other candidates, you assume is going to be hard-working on features as well, and they also seem sharp because they know so much (about IT, but other things as well). Some things are contrasting.  The hard-working person who knows the programming language in and out, and who gets a lot of feature work done is probably willing  to sacrifice a little comity within the group to get a feature out.  On the other hand, some people are so stubborn and argumentative, their presence would be a negative, even if they have technical skills.  But some personality traits can contrast - I've working with friendly, supportive leads with great technical skills, but if they are a little bit hard charging this type of thing might be expected to come with the package of being very good technically. reply",

I rely on AI coding assistants to help me build projects, but I’ve run into a common problem: most good ones are paid or have very limited free tiers.<p>For example, I used Augment Code (1,000 free daily requests) and Kiro IDE (200 free daily requests), but both eventually moved behind paywalls.<p>I’m hoping to find recommendations for new or still-free AI coding assistants that I can use without hitting strict limits.<p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

      "title": "Ask HN: What toolchains are people using for desktop app development in 2025?",
      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I recently came across a comment [0] here that highlighted the challenges of building native desktop apps with LLMs. The commenter pointed out how scarce training resources have become—few blog posts, tutorials, or open-source projects exist compared to web or mobile development. They also noted that while desktop app development was a solid career path in the 90s, it's now seen as a dead end for most, outside of big players like Microsoft or Adobe.<p>This got me thinking: My own experience with desktop development dates back to the late 90s using Turbo Pascal 6 in Delphi, and I'm out of the loop on modern practices. With the evolving landscape, I'm curious about what tools and workflows developers are actually using today.<p>Some questions to spark discussion:<p>- What programming languages and frameworks are popular for desktop apps?\n- Are there any go-to IDEs, build tools, or libraries that make development easier?\n- Do the above answers change if you care about code performance or efficiency (whatever that means to you)?\n- Is native desktop app development still viable as a career, or are most greenfield projects shifting to web-based alternatives?<p>I'd love to hear from folks with recent experience—success stories, pitfalls, and recommendations would be great. Thanks in advance for sharing!<p>[0] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44841291\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44841291</a></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Sorry for taking so long to respond...I was out on vacation! The general strategy is to figure out what state needs to be stored in your app, and combine that into one div in the page that can be grabbed via something like  innerHTML. For a gallery app that is viewing pictures on copyparty, that will be the metadata, like the URL of the image, the tags you want to apply and/or what category it is in, the index within the album, the date info, etc. Then, when your page loads, you can load all that and reason about how to arrange your photos, what to display, etc.  Once that's done, the URLs can be swapped in to generate the appropriate view.  I would give some thought to how to leverage WebDAV to create a directory that can store e.g. thumbnails.  Copyparty does that itself, but your app should likely have its own disk-based cache accessible from a folder served by Copyparty. The self-save part is mostly creating a something like a clone function that knows how to clone the static parts and inject updated sections for the data. I've written a little about about how to do this in my post years ago about a TiddlyWiki saver written for jart's Cosmopolitan. https://rpdillon.net/redbean-tiddlywiki-saver.html I've iterated on it quite a bit since then, and haven't updated my site accordingly. It's probably worth documenting the progress I've made since. reply",

          "text": "I have been evaluating and testing the Filesystem API for a local first web based CAD editor and having direct r/w access to the filesystem is a great way to make such a thing, couple with the FilesystemObserver[1] API this makes building proper editors on the web a breeze. In place of this, Firefox recommends using the origin private file system (OPFS)[2] which is basically a sandboxed filesystem that the users cannot access. Though I agree from a security perspective it kind of makes sense (not particularly for my usecase), but it removes the ability for the user to have realtime changes on local files. An example of this is using the web based tool as an intermediary step or a processing step in a bigger pipeline; I save it using my web tool and then native applications automatically handle file updates.\nThis just creates an extra step for Firefox/Safari to replicate changes locally by having to manually update local files. Also neither Firefox nor Safari support showDirectoryPicker() which also creates blocks for building a web based editor. I love Firefox and I hope they can add support for this. I have stopped caring about Safari/Webkit completely because it's hellish to try and maintain feature parity while NOT sacrificing innovation and ease of use.

Overall it's not terrible, except for being proprietary and Windows only. Outside of work, I'm out in left field using Common Lisp for most of my projects, so I'm not sure how helfpul this is, but... In the past, I used Qt4 because there was an amazing Common Lisp binding and it worked well on Linux, FreeBSD and OSX.  It's increasingly hard to use Qt4 any more, though, and changes in the Qt project made the technique used by the Qt4 bindings impractical for Qt5 or Qt6 - at least that was my understanding when I looked into it. For newer things I've tried LTK but don't really like the looks of it and I wouldn't say it's \"modern\".  It seems to work across platform well enough, though, and for simple stuff it's okay. More often than not I'm using a combination of the Slime tools in Emacs in combination with an GLFW/OpenGL window.  Often I'll use the inspector to display data and make changes that show up in an OpenGL window, or run some commands in the REPL and pop up an image in an external viewer or load something in a browser.  It only works for certain types of applications, and I won't even pretend it's practical for end users, but it works pretty well, and it's flexible as a developer. I'm curious to see what other people say.  It's been a while since I madea full blown GUI application. reply",

          "text": "Topping my list of GUI toolkit requirements are cross-platform and native look & feel. As far as I know, Qt still beats everything else in these areas on the desktop. It's mostly excellent. However, I find The Qt Group's commercial licensing (and their tactics as reported by various people on HN) a little scary. If I were to go commercial, I think I would stick with LGPL Qt and link dynamically or give customers my object files for re-linking, because I get the impression that accepting a commercial Qt license could restrict my ability to use open-source Qt elsewhere. I suppose there might be some other way to safely navigate those waters, but from what I've read, The Qt Group has a reputation for making this far from hassle-free. It's not an immediate problem because I currently use Qt only for open-source and personal tools. I have grown tired of C++, so I've been using Python to drive Qt. The bindings are very good, mirroring the C++ API so closely that I just use the C++ docs when I need to look something up. I've also been watching for Qt bindings to other compiled languages, mainly for distributing non-Linux GUI apps more simply than Python allows. Such bindings often turn out to expose only Qt Quick, which lacks functionality that I sometimes need, but there are a few that expose Qt Widgets. For example, these Go bindings: https://github.com/mappu/miqt I hope we'll eventually see a cross-platform GUI toolkit rivaling Qt in a language more pleasant than C++ (and ideally easier to bind to other languages). The one being developed for internal use by the Zed editor has some promising ideas about how to render native-looking text, which I think is a good start: https://zed.dev/blog/videogame https://www.gpui.rs/ reply",

It's not just a single hermetically sealed box. This part comes from one supplier, this part from another. Both can be modified, and require different skills to modify. 2. You start from day 1 to take baby steps in thinking about whom to trust. Here there are 2 separate projects that would be very hard to collude together.

          "text": "There's a GUI library: https://github.com/flamendless/Slab In general, if you use a minority platform you have to assume it has a tiny minority testing it and so budget for there to be more bugs and so on. LÖVE itself is rock solid, but programs built on it may not be. So I try to minimize the number of layers of libraries I add atop it. So far that has meant I found it easier to just draw my own UI in all my programs.[1] I've only played with Slab a little bit myself. If you use Slab, please do report bugs. I've done that in the past when I've used it. That's what it takes to make a minority platform more stable. [1] Drawing all my own UI also keeps my download sizes small. For example, https://akkartik.itch.io/carousel is 400KB. If you take out 4 fonts and the extensive online help, the code itself is only 100KB. By comparison, Slab seems to be almost 1MB of code. But that's just me. I care a lot about being easy to download on slow internet connections, and less code seems more hackable. But I give up some creature comforts, and reasonable people will disagree with me about the value of a UI library. reply",

The project I am currently building is a software infra for building E2EE applications, and it requires a little bit of everything - mobile apps for key management, desktop/cli apps/client libraries for actually encrypting data, sometimes a web based app, and a zero trust backend. Using Xamarin/MAUI for mobile apps, Blazor WASM for Web, Blazor Hybrid / MAUI / Avalonia UI for Desktop. All of the frameworks have their quirks, so it may take a bit of time to learn your patterns, build your base classes, but after that you pretty much enjoy the productivity of a modern high level language. - What programming languages and frameworks are popular for desktop apps?\n- for me - Blazor Hybrid / MAUI / Avalonia UI / WinForms - Are there any go-to IDEs, build tools, or libraries that make development easier?\n- I use MSVS 2022, VSCode for .NET, IntelliJ for $$$ at work. There are of course UI control libraries, I am using MudBlazor for Blazor WASM / Hybrid, other than that I use built-in controls that come with each framework. I try to use as little as possible of 3rd party libraries b/c my apps are security-sensitive. - Do the above answers change if you care about code performance or efficiency (whatever that means to you)? \n- in my case no, I am able to find what I need in .NET ecosystem. Modern .NET supports ahead-of-time compilation compiling to native code, and that helps to reduce start-up time which is important for Desktop / CLI. Ironically, for a long running processes, like a web service, the just-in-time compilation sometimes produces code running faster than ahead-of-time compilation, b/c it learns most common execution paths at runtime, and is able to recompile on the fly, optimizing for most frequent execution paths, giving a non-trivial performance boost in some cases - Is native desktop app development still viable as a career, or are most greenfield projects shifting to web-based alternatives\n- depends on the app/use case. For my project, desktop is the first class citizen, but I am building E2EE apps, i.e. end-to-end-encryption apps, aka client-side encryption, and native / Desktop / CLI is a better fit for E2EE in most of the cases compared to web apps. For those Web apps that I have it is still E2EE but in the browser (still client side encryption) reply",
