This is not a traditional enterprise sale:\n- Deals are driven by automations, as they are built live in-app\n- Customers engage multiple times per week and see value instantly \n- Expansion is natural because the product is horizontal, the first team is never the last We’re looking for someone who:\n- Loves going deep on product and customer problems\n- Can work comfortably with operators and execs (CFO/COO) as well as with companies in the retail/ ecom/ CPG + freight/ logistics spaces \n- Cares deeply about solving real problems \n- Wants to help build the Enterprise motion, not just run a playbook Parabola had its biggest year ever in 2025. We’re consistently exceeding targets, and there is serious demand that is pulling us upmarket. You’d be working closely with our CRO, COO, CEO and GTM team to shape how Enterprise sales is done here.\nIf you’re an experienced AE (5+ years in SaaS sales) who wants to sell something genuinely powerful with real customer impact, we’d love to talk. https://parabola.io/careers and https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/parabola-io/881f7a72-e377-412f-81c6... reply",

          "text": "Yes, I have a Casio fx-9750GIII and I love it. I still haven't found an Android app or website that can do everything that I need (basic functionality), but in general: - I need physical buttons. I often find that on touchscreens I mistype something and I don't notice. - The history feature. Maybe I want to do a serial task or calculation, and I can just replace/correct one of the formulas in the history and it automatically recalculates all of the expressions that came after it. - I have written some micropython code / utilities for the calculator and I use it all the time. - I don't want to context switch to do a quick calculation. On my PC I have to open up a new terminal or a website (I might be offline, so I have to hotspot and then connect the wifi and ...) and interrupt my existing work or I have to frequently switch between a PDF or latex or whatever that I'm working on. - Typing out `sin` or `np.sin` or `sin^-1` on PC is both longer and more error prone. It gets very frustrating very quickly. - The numerical solver is a godsend. Try solving for the roots of an expression like `xe^x = 10` on your PC without internet. Or with an android application. On my calculator it's just a few dedicated button presses. On the PC, I have to use isympy and typeout `nsolve(Eq(x * exp(x), 10), 1)`, and you wouldn't even get a proper graphical display of the expression while you are typing it. reply",

In those circumstances, the calculator's compact form factor is quite convenient, compared to needing two hands at the computer keyboard, or one handedly hunt-pecking said keyboard. As for the mouse, that has to be the slowest, most focus stealing option of them all. The calculator doesn't take much room, so it can be kept within arm's reach without getting in the way, quickly gives me the numbers I need, without demanding I become fully engaged with it. Also, those old HP buttons are just so nice to press, a refreshing break from the dead flat glass you get everywhere else these days. reply",

If I'm using this app I probably also have measuring tools out for a DIY project. I go to spreadsheets for anything beyond that using \"Office: Planmaker\". It handles the xlsx format perfectly!

Engineers, accountants, etc. would be more productive by being able to do calculations without having to reach for a slide rule or pencil and paper.

And doubled as a learning TV remote & TV-B-Gone. I also have a virtual HP48 on my phone, tablets, and computers. In middle school, I had an HP 32SII. I remember being able to hear** either the processor clock or data line(s) of each of the 32 and 48 because one or more components acted as inadvertent audio oscillators that would make noises during computation (and during idle on the 48 because it had to keep redrawing the clock). I've used R, MATLAB, pspice, and Mathematica in the past. I'm a fan of Xcas and Wolfram Alpha now. * I also have a collection of HP 48[GS]X cards, the printer, and the overhead projector adapter. In lieu of the overpriced official HP 48G to computer RS-232 interface cable, one can be easily made from a Sony CD-ROM audio cable. ** With my much younger ear pressed up to it. reply",

Domain should  never depend on infrastructure or application layer and so on. But the projects I got have domain that depend on infrastructure and another one where application has a reference directly to infrastructure and been told that this is correct implementation... doh..<p>I think I was kind of a good at listening for the lectures, but I now am doubting about, whether it was worth learning stuff at all lol since it's so controversial out there. I am, of course, in no position to question senior dev, but what do you guys think - is it really normal that all the college so called \"best practices\" go straight to the trash bin or am I just misunderstanding the real-work-like context?</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "1. also helps you after the first 3-6 months. As in, you can't change the entire code base (if reasonably large). Not even with AI helping you with the tedious bits. Consistency is something that does have value, even if it's not global and even if the consistent thing is not how you would've done/called it. The more consistency you can get, the better, because it helps tremendously. Both you and also an AI. If things are named consistently it doesn't matter whether you call a potato a potato or a potahto. It just matters that you don't call it an orange half the time. We have a relatively good code base in this regard for example. To find things, I literally just hit the shortcut to open file/class by name, start typing the camel case for what I need and I'm usually there. Like, if I need to know what exactly we do for writing the potahto to the database, I type PoRep and I'll probably see the PotatoRepositoryImpl and I'm where I need to be. Of course not everything is roses. I might want to know what the service layer for the potahto does and start typing PotSer and I find nothing, because half the domain objects call the service layer a service and the other half calls it manager . That's OK. That's called \"local consistency\" and it happens as a code base grows and ages and different people with different opinions build in it and don't know enough about the magic of consistency and think they know better but can't or don't want to change the existing code base. As long as it doesn't get out of hand, it's not a big deal and you can slowly converge. 2. This is such a big one, thank you! Too many people don't believe in Chesterton's fence. They know so much better! Rewrite everything! And it is OK and good to question why the fence is there! Nothing is worse than \"we do it this way because we've always done it that way!\". But also, if you never question the fence's existence, you're stuck forever. This is an anecdote I found very good in this regard. A group of scientists places five monkeys in a room with a ladder and a banana on top. When one monkey tries to reach the banana, all are sprayed with cold water. Eventually, all of them stop attempting to climb. The scientists then place a new monkey who knows nothing of the water incident. When the new monkey sees the banana and tries to climb, the others prevent them from reaching it. Nobody gets sprayed any longer. The scientists slowly replace any of the original monkeys that were actually sprayed with water with new ones. Eventually there are no monkeys left that experienced the spraying. Yet no monkey ever even tries to get the banana any more. So, do challenge Chesterston's fence's existence! Try to find one of the monkeys that actually got sprayed with water, so that you may understand why the fence was there. Or in other words ask the other monkeys why the eff you can't go for the banana. And if nobody can tell you other than \"coz we've never done it like that\", then try it. For all you know, the pesky scientist with the hose is long gone! reply",

Some minor points: - What you learned in college was not a waste. - When it comes to software development, everything is controversial to someone . And ever-changing. - You need to spend a good 12-18 months acquiring situational awareness. It's pretty common in life to attain a level and discover you \"know nothing\" and have it feel like you're starting over from scratch. It's just an illusion, but it's also kind of true. Eg. You get your blue belt in Brazilian Jui Jujitsu, and realize there's a whole other Jedi level you weren't aware of. - Regardless, trust in your abilities, master the fundamentals, listen to mentors, and ride the wave. - The progress graph is not a flat line upwards. There's peaks and valleys, but as long as it trends up, you're doing good. reply",

But as you really learn and become more of a chef, these are just skill sets and experiences you pull on to make the right thing in the right moment.

I’d suggest you maintain your knowledge and build upon it for how to build systems that scale both organizationally and from a performance pov. That way, you can identify which parts can be made better in the existing system without breaking it. Ultimately, the customer really doesn’t care about the internals as long as whatever they’re using solves their immediate problem. They hold the ultimate card because they will just switch to another service provider if they’re cheaper, even if their product is worse. So don’t become jaded. Become an expert in systems engineering and work on making things better. When you have a chance to work on a green field project, apply your knowledge there and make a foundation that will outlast your commits. But realize that the business might toss your perfect shiny approach into the bin if it doesn’t translate into $. Don’t take it personally. Optimize for the best solution given the $ and time constraints. For example, adding better test coverage might help reduce issues that result in headaches and lost productivity, or worse down times. Or adding a better interface to a poorly written implementation so you’re not tossing out everything just reducing the surface area for problems. Good luck!

          "text": "Quick answer: the code tends to mirror the way the project is run. Read on if you want my elaboration and advice. The good thing about being a junior dev is that your decisions don't have much impact yet and nobody trusts you anyway. The bad thing is that people trust experience way too much and will eventually start to dump more work on you and not question you. That's when the real struggle begins. This struggle doesn't stop until you retire. It's the precious nature of limited time and attention. Other people's struggles have produced the strange code you're looking at right now. Your gut is right. Don't trust that code, but also know that your time is limited and you need to stay focused on your assigned tasks. Stay curious and take mental note, but never make a move until you know you can without consequence. You have other stuff to do. Eventually bugs will be found or new features will be assigned to you. Only then do you have sufficient information to act. The description of the bug or feature tells you more than the code ever did. Code just tells you how. Bugs and requirements will tell you what it does and why. So now here's my advice. Teamwork is hard work and people can develop antisocial behavior that causes dysfunction and ultimately bad code. Nobody ever truly has the full picture or full authority. Don't trust anyone who claims to regardless of titles or years of experience. On the opposite end, some people seek solitary refuge in their work but doing the same will hold you back too. Avoid staying siloed amongst the devs, and run from the places that force you to. Don't buy into hype and always do the minimum that works. Good code is less code, but expect to write more. Your education is valuable, and your eyes don't deceive you. Don't let people get to you and it will be fine. reply",

I have been in corporate software for nearly 20 years.  During my time there have been three completely unrelated paths: career elevation, technical brilliance, and finally seeking employment.  I cannot say if this will hold true into the future, but it has been true for a long time. First, know what you want and that will tell you who to follow.  So, let's talk about this. If you want to ascend in your career you need to focus on mastery of only two things: soft skills and conscientiousness (awareness).  Career elevation ultimately means some combination of management people and/or projects.  You actually have to care about the people you are managing or you can be a complete dick if you are an outsider who knows the right people at the proper levels.  You also need to be masterful at management of multiple work streams, calendars, and event timelines impacting multiple teams.  Imagine being in three unrelated conversations simultaneously all day long and still knowing the technical details about what is happening better than the people on each of those multiple chats/calls without exhaustion. Technical brilliance comes from building ambitious things.  If you aren't constantly building new and ever more challenging things at work then you need to be doing it outside of work.  This typically has a negative impact on career progression unless you are willing to get a PhD and make a career out of research like Roy Fielding.  It has a negative impact on career progression because demands a tremendous amount of time practicing on things that are not directly tied to the key goals of your employer's business goals. Then finally there are people whose only goal is seeking employment or raises from jumping between employers.  This is counter productive to both career elevation and technical skill growth, but can be good if you are a future founder and are trying to build out personal relationships.  I have always thought of these people as trend followers and bottom feeders from a technical skill perspective. reply",

          "text": "So different colleges have different courses, and focus on different things. So what I say next is very much YMMV. Back when I did college there was a disconnect between what students thought college was for, and what colleges thought college was for. This was ultimately addressed in 2nd year, but it took me decades to really understand it. As students we went to college thinking we were being taught skills to prepare us for getting jobs. Which given the endless \"you need to go to college to get a decent job\" mantra seems reasonable. My college however believed that job skills are basically easily assimilated and can be quickly learned after you get the job. What makes it possible to learn fast are solid foundational skills and understandings. For example a chef is better off learning the science of food, and honing knife skills. Once hired they can learn French recipes or Italian recipes or whatever. In our case the complaint was about language; we learned in C and C++, with forays into assembler and Scheme. Job postings were for Cobol and Java (this was the 90s). To show us language was irrelevant we did 10 assignments in 10 days. The same problem 10 times over, but in a different language every day. And this is pre www, so harder than it would be now. But still, turns out, really easy. Now sure, good theory doesn't always make it into the real world in a perfect state. But I continue to be amazed at how much the fundamentals matter. 35 years later and I still ground my work in solid theory. And I notice a lot those around MD who are lacking that theory. So, I'd say yes, lean into the theory. Yes the real world is messy, but knowing best practices, and encouraging their use always pays off in the long term. I'll counterpoint that though that juniors always want huge sweeping changes to make it conform to their newly minted theory. Don't be that guy. It's OK to spend some time first getting to know your work system. Then you can enquire about past decisions made, and choices made. Then suggest small (and later larger) improvements. Good luck, and have fun. reply",

In the real work experience every project, team, and company are a little bit unique in how they respond to the requirements and politics of the moment. Everyone is trying to get something done and how purely it follows some pattern or rule is only relevant as far as it helps get the work done. What you learned wasnt useless - it was probably very helpful for understanding or at least getting exposed to lots of concepts that you'll need. However, just like the joke about physicists and their spherical cows, the perfect algorithms and architecture rules from school aren't even close to the whole story in the trenches. A non-engineering anecdote - had a math professor tasked with determining a fit line for and integration of a bunch of sensor data (needed the total area under the curve, classic math test problem). College me imagined trying to craft bespoke integratable functions and maybe some multi part fitting optimization but I knew my little list of memorized formulas couldn't touch this real life data so I was looking forward to the veteran approach. Math guy printed it, eyeballed to fill in the gaps with a pen, cut it out, and weighed it against a sample of \"1x1\" unit squares of the paper. I was flabbergasted but the dude was so obviously right -- one off task, collected data with no clear pattern, didn't need crazy precision. The \"obvious\" answer took far less time than anything I had in mind and was plenty good enough for the problem at hand. tl;dr - what you learned so far wasn't wasted it was simply the very beginning of filling up your mental toolbox reply",

And if we're going to be technical (and come on, this is computing so we should be) - then really the answer is \"it depends\" for every single one of them.

Best practices like clean architecture exist to solve specific problems: making code easier to test, change, and reason about at scale. The key insight is understanding which problems they solve and when those problems actually matter. A domain layer that depends on infrastructure might be \"wrong\" by the textbook, but if it's a small internal tool with 3 users and a 2-year expected lifespan, the coupling probably doesn't matter. The cost of the \"correct\" abstraction exceeds the benefit. What I'd suggest: when you see code that violates a pattern you learned, ask yourself \"what problem would the 'correct' approach solve here, and does that problem actually exist in this context?\" Sometimes the answer is \"yes, and this code will bite us later.\" Often it's \"no, the simpler approach is fine for this use case.\" The ability to make that judgment - knowing when to apply rigor and when simplicity wins - is what separates effective senior devs from people who cargo-cult patterns regardless of context. reply",

And if so, how did it go?<p>I’m curious because it seems like the vast majority of early capital raises seem to go to paying for software development, and a small group of engineers could (in theory) output a few million dollars worth of value. It might not be attractive to VCs but it could probably form a business that lets coop members lead very comfortable lives.</p></p></div>",

          "text": "I've recently become curious about the scene, and discovered quite a bit going on. It seems most tech coops are operating more like agencies, taking on client work. Haven't seen many developing products. Here is a great list of tech coops: https://tech-coops.xyz/ Here is a new but somewhat active matrix channel where some tech coops folks hangout: https://matrix.to/#/#techcoop:autonomic.zone We plan to have an informal call to chat there on 22nd of February at 17:00-18:30 UTC. Here is a Discourse forum for tech coops: https://community.coops.tech/ Note that a big problem with building a product tech coop is that you exactly can't as easily raise millions: investors by definition cannot take stake in a coop. Instead, you need a business loan, and its less common to find financiers willing to loan large rounds for high risk investment. That may be a cultural thing though, because in theory, sufficient interest could offset the risk in aggregate I guess. reply",

          "text": "A recent thought: It might interesting to set up an open source group that provides an ecosystem of re-usable tools and libraries that interoperate well, and solve problems that are otherwise solved with with repetitive flakey internal implementations by several players in an industry. Sort of like Apache Software Foundation, Spring Framework (for java), Boost (for c++), but higher level and industry-specific, e.g. for finance, some libraries and tools for handing FIX protocol, parsing file formats from market data vendors, also tooling for change management / releases etc. I am sure each industry has its collection of common use cases, like geology tools/libraries for mining, or handling genetic data for bioinformatics/pharma, etc. The group, though, should have a corporate-friendly outward branding, be composed of people actually working in the industry, and somewhat selective with membership. A goal, perhaps not mentioned on the website but known to members, would be that the organization exists for the benefit of its members getting hired in the industry, consulting work, hiring each other when practical, books, training, etc. on using the libraries and tools. In a way, it's really not anything too original, and I am sure close to how many open source groups have always operated in practice, crossed with a something like a guild/union/professional network. The main thought would be to do this for what seems like a \"missing middle\" of industry-specific stuff where there are maybe tens or hundreds of potential client companies, so not totally generic like kernels/compilers/spring/boost, but not a big enough market to attract a VC backed company, but big enough to offer cushy jobs for a few dozen people who would never have to do leetcode interviews ever again. reply",

It even surprised me and researched the different seats and recommended a cheaper one or free activities as an alternative that weekend.

          "text": "Same here. I like tinkering with my Home Assistant setup and small web server running miscellaneous projects on my Raspberry Pi, but I hate having to debug it from my phone when it all falls over while I'm not near my computer. Being able to chat with somebody that has a working understanding of a Unix environment and can execute tasks like \"figure out why Caddy is crash looping and propose solutions\" for a few dollars per month is a dream come true. I'm not actually using OpenClaw for that just yet, though; something about exposing my full Unix environment to OpenAI or Anthropic just seems wrong, both in terms of privacy and dependency. The former could probably be solved with some redacting and permission-enforcing filter between the agent and the OS, but the latter needs powerful local models. (I'll only allow my Unix devops skills to start getting rusty once I can run an Opus 4.5 equivalent agent on sub-$5000 hardware :) reply",

          "text": "Honest answer: OpenClaw still requires some tinkering, but it's getting easier. The biggest barrier for non-tinkerers is the initial setup - Node.js, API keys, permissions, etc. Once it's running, day-to-day use is pretty straightforward (chat with it like any other messaging app). That said, you'll still need to:\n- Understand basic API costs to avoid surprises\n- Know when to restart if it gets stuck\n- Tweak settings for your specific use case If you're determined to skip tinkering entirely, I'd suggest starting with just the messaging integration (WhatsApp/Telegram) and keeping skills/tools minimal. That's the lowest-friction path. For setup guidance without deep technical knowledge, I found howtoopenclawfordummies.com helpful - it's aimed at beginners and covers the common gotchas. Is it transformative without tinkering? Not yet. The magic comes from customization. But the baseline experience (AI assistant via text) is still useful. reply",

Why is this so fking cool and foundationally game changing? Because now, my agent Patch and I can spin up MULTIPLE CLAUDE CODE instances, and work on any repository (or repositories) I want, with parallel agents. Well, I could already spawn multiple agents through my iphone connection without Patch, but the problem is then I need to MANAGE each spawned agent, micromanaging each agent instance myself. But now, I have a SUPERVISOR for all my agents, Patch is the SUPERVISOR of my muliple claude code instances. This means I no longer have to context switch by brain between five or 10 or 20 different tmux on my own to command and control multiple different claude code instances. I can now just let my SUPERVISOR agent, Patch, command and control the mulitple agents and then report back to me the status or any issues. All through a single telegram chat with my supervisor agent, Patch. This frees up my brain to only have to just have to manage Patch the supervisor, instead of micro-managing all the different agents myself. Now, I have a true management structure which allows me to more easily scale. This is AWESOME. reply",

Finally, we create granular tasks called \"beads\" (see https://github.com/steveyegge/beads ). The beads allows us to create epics/tasks/subtasks and associated dependency structure down to a granular bead, and then the agents pull a \"bead\" to implement. So, mostly we're either creating spec docs and creating beads or implementing, quality checking, and testing the code created from an agent implementing a bead. I can say this produces better code than I could write after 10yrs of focused daily coding myself. However, I don't think \"vibe coders\" that have never truly learned to code, have any realistic chance of creating decent code in a large complex code base that requires a complex backend schema to be built.

If you have a bunch of human junior devs and even a senior dev or two that join your org to help you build an app, and you don't have any dev/ops structure in place for them, then you will end up with \"spaghetti\" throughout all your code/systems, from those relatively bright humans. Its the same managing agents. It cannot be expected to build a complex system from simple \"one shot me a <x> feature\" from a bunch of different agents, each with a finite ~150k token context limit. It must be done in context of the system you have in place. If you have a poor/no system structure, you'll end up with garbage for code. Everything that I said I had to guide the agents, is also useful for human devs. I'm sure that all the FANGS and various advanced software companies also use custom linters, etc., for every code check in. It's just now become easier to have these advanced code quality structures in place, and it is absolutely necessary when managing/coordinating agents to build a complex application. reply",

Could I build this with Claude Code and some glue? Sure.

Virtually everything I've tried (starting with just getting it running) was broken in some way. Most of those things I was able to use an LLM to resolve, which is cool, but also why doesn't it just work to begin with? I still haven't gotten it to successfully create a cron job. Also messages keep getting lost between the web GUI and discord. Trying to enable the matrix integration broke the whole thing. It seems to be able to recall past sessions, but only sometimes. I've been using OpenCode with various models, often times running several instances in tmux that I can connect to and switch between over ssh. It feels like the hype around openclaw is mostly from bringing the multi-instance agentic experience to non-developers, and providing some nice hooks to integrate with email, twitter, etc. But given that I have a nice setup running opencode in little firejail-isolated containers, I'll probably drop openclaw. Way too janky, and I can't get over the thought of \"if this is so amazing, why doesn't it work?\" reply",

          "text": "I'm running it on an old MacBook that I wiped a few months ago and had lying around. I tried installing it on an old raspberry pi first, but it was super slow and the skills ecosystem wants to use brew which doesn't work so well on the pi. First impressions are that it's actually pretty interesting from an interface perspective. I could see a bigger provider using this to great success. Obviously it's not as revolutionary as people are hyping it up to be, but it's a step in the right direction. It reimagines where an agent interface should be in relation to the user and their device. For some reason it's easier to think of an agent as a dedicated machine, and it feels more capable when it's your own. I think this project nails a new type of UX for LLM agents. It feels very similar to the paradigm shift felt after using Claude Code --dangerously-skip-permissions on a codebase, except this is for your whole machine. It also feels much less ephemeral than normal LLM sessions. But it still fills up its context pretty quickly, so you see diminishing returns. I was a skeptic until I actually installed it and messed around with it. So far I'm not doing anything that I couldn't already do with Claude Code, but it is kind of cool to be able to text with an agent that lives on your hardware and has a basic memory of what you're using it for, who you are, etc. It feels more like a personal assistant than Claude Code which feels more like a disposable consultant. I don't know if it really lives up to the hype, but it does make you think a little differently about how these tools should be presented and what their broader capabilities might be.  I like the local files first mentality.  It makes me excited for a time when running local models becomes easier. I should add that it's very buggy.  It worked great last night, now none of my prompts go through. reply",

Today it’s only a landing page + short survey (no product yet) to test whether this pain is real.<p>The core idea (2–3 bullets):<p>- Many of us capture tons of useful info (notes/links/docs), but it rarely becomes shipped work.<p>- Instead of better “organization” (tags/folders), I’m exploring an “action engine” that:<p><pre><code>  1.detects what you’re actively targetting/working on (“active projects”)\n\n  2.surfaces relevant saved material at the right moment\n\n  3.proposes a concrete next action (ideally pushed into your existing task tool)\n</code></pre>\nMy own “second brain” became a graveyard of good intentions: the organizing tax was higher than the value I got back. I’m trying to validate whether the real bottleneck is execution, not capture.<p>Before writing code, I’m trying to pin down two things:<p>- Project context signals (repo/PRs? issues? tasks? calendar? a “project doc”?)<p>- How to close the loop: ingest knowledge → rank against active projects → emit a small set of next-actions into an existing todo tool → learn from outcomes (done/ignored/edited) and optionally write back the minimal state. The open question: what’s the cleanest feedback signal without creating noise or privacy risk? (explicit ratings vs completion events vs doc-based write-back)<p>What I’m asking from you:<p>1.Where does your “second brain” break down the most?<p>capture / organization / retrieval / execution\n(If you can, share a concrete recent example.)<p>2.What best represents “active project context” for you today?<p><pre><code>  task project (Todoist/Things/Reminders)\n\n  issues/boards (GitHub/Linear/Jira)\n\n  a doc/wiki page (Notion/Docs)\n\n  calendar\n\n  \"in my head\"\n</code></pre>\nWhich one would you actually allow a tool to read?<p>3.What’s your hard “no” for an AI that suggests actions from your notes/links? (pick 1–2)<p><pre><code>  privacy/data retention\n\n  noisy suggestions / interruption\n\n  hallucinations / wrong suggestions\n\n  workflow change / migration cost\n\n  pricing\n\n  others</code></pre></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

It commits to memory, not to action. I really don't care about having a whole searchable, tagged database; I hardly ever look at those notes again. At work I have topic-based Markdown notes. Sometimes I collect information about a topic for a few weeks or months, and eventually turn it into a proper guide (making guides is my job). I also LOVE paper notebooks, because they become a beautiful timeline of sketches, to-do lists, thoughts and plans. When I finish a notebook, I scan it then throw it in a drawer. I also use Obsidian daily notes to journal, mostly because it's easier to open an app than to write in a notebook. I don't do anything special with those notes, unless I'm trying to \"debug\" something happening in my life. [0] https://strangestloop.io/essays/things-that-arent-doing-the-... reply",

For a lot of us, what we store is really a snapshot of attention, curiosity, anxiety, and identity at a moment in time — more like a personal log than a database. One framing that helps me is: the archive isn’t “truth”, it’s “evidence of what I cared about”, and it’s only useful when it reduces friction for a real moment (re-entry, reflection, or a concrete next step). Otherwise it’s just noise. Do you find it more useful as a mirror (patterns about yourself), or as a tool (helping you make decisions / take action)? reply",

In other cases it forces me to actually understand what I'm feeling in order to put it into words. In a sense those notes could be write-only and still be useful. In other cases these notes are a complement to my photos. They show a different aspect of my life at a given moment. My photos don't show that on September 4, 2015, I had a massive crush on someone. I have built a timeline that combines my journals, photos, sketches, geolocation, Google searches and other things. It reveals a far more nuanced picture of me at a given time. I also have more technical notes. Those are a bit of a \"collection of facts\". It's a bit like putting all the parts on the table, and slowly organising them into a coherent structure. This is how I approach bigger topics before I understand them fully. Then my notes act as a sort of medium-term memory. When I finish a project, I usually have a bunch of leftover notes and todos that I don't intend to ever finish. That's why I say that notes are not an obligation. reply",

One nuance: the way I’m thinking about this isn’t “you type a query and wait for an LLM”. It’s more like local indexing/pre-computation so retrieval is instant, and any heavier processing happens ahead of time (or during a scheduled review) so it never blocks you. Then you can consume it as a pull-based view or a tiny daily digest—no interruptions, no spinning cursor. If you could pick one: would you prefer a deterministic synonyms/alias layer (instant, fully controllable), or a local semantic index that improves recall but still feels “tool-like” rather than “AI”?

          "text": "I'm working on a project in this realm. Basically I am building a \"personal\" spyware/data collection software suite. Kind of in the same realm as ms recall but more focused on security/privacy with sensible cryptographic defaults where needed. It is basically a server/data store and client agents, currently the agent is only for linux end user devices. The agent records evdev events (keystrokes/mouse movement), currently active window, clipboard history, shell commands issued and browsing behaviour. It runs as its own user and different functionality is compartmentalized into their own processes. Data is encrypted at rest. I'm still looking into how to best handle sensitive data in-memory at runtime. It stores these events in a persistent queue on the clients and one-way syncs it to the server. If a client is offline for a bit it syncs it when it comes back online. As such, I am also trying to minimize storage used. The idea is that rather than overwhelmingly linking stuff manually, e.g. with obsidian, locality of reference seems more useful as a baseline. In this data set, links by time are valued the most. In the future I'd like to add also the screenshot/video feature using hashes and perceptual hashes or an RDP like way to store as little data as possible. For now I'm mostly in the architecting phase but I do have an early working version. Really looking for suggestions architecture wise too. So far I came up with my own binary format to save events on the clients but I'm unsure if it's the right way to go. There are many challenges to be thought about, such as changing hardware configuration (display plugged in), protecting against statistical analysis (e.g. keystroke bursts), deletion of data across sources if required, how to make sure the system can run smoothly for a decade, etc. reply",

          "text": "While I do hoard notes I've realized over the years that the main reason I write notes is as a memory aid.  If I write it down I remember it better, and I'm more likely to do it.  Notes also act as a filter because I write stuff down, sometimes review the notes later, and decide what I wrote down isn't worth doing, so making a note of an idea essentially gives me a delay to review the idea and decide if it is worth doing.  I do also record links, keeping them in wiki pages (along with wiki pages for notes about various projects); I started doing that because browser histories today seem to autodelete old links.  Putting them into a wiki makes them searchable.  I keep journals as well, which are also searchable.  I don't necessarily want to be reminded of my notes and wiki/journal entries, I know they are there, I mainly want to call them up when I decide I need them.  That's the main drawback of paper notes, I can't search them.  I've tried scanning them, but it's tedious and they don't translate to ASCII text well, and drawings are not searchable.  I've considered using one of the e-paper notepads instead of paper notes, but I'd need a notepad handy in every room of the house and that would cost too much, and the procedures to automatically sync them to a central location don't seem very reliable (and I don't want to sync personal notes to some public cloud). So for me, an AI that suggests stuff would be annoying.  An AI that could take some vague search terms and my history and could pull old information out of notes that don't necessarily have the keywords I enter, using the context provided by my history might be useful.  So for example, I may remember I happened across a design for the DSP algorithms in guitar pedals, but the URL or note may not even mention DSP, so something that could turn a search for \"guitar pedal DSP\" into finding a link for an audio processing web page I visited would be useful.  The AI would probably have to scan all the web pages I visit to be able to store enough context to be useful for a search like that.  Doing this for 20 years or more might run into some scalability/cost issues. reply",

Context, long-term memory, and storage issues are indeed challenges currently facing AI and large language models (LLMs), and they're not unique to the scenarios we're discussing. However, with technological advancements, I believe these issues will eventually be resolved. Based on your requirements, it seems you need to grant the AI sufficiently broad access and privacy permissions. That said, leveraging what you've already stored, achieving the fuzzy retrieval functionality you mentioned should be feasible. It's impressive that you can recall exactly where to find your notes! That said, active retrieval still requires you to remember what you're looking for. I think your fuzzy retrieval concept shares some similarities with what I'm aiming for—where the AI offers suggestions based on your intended actions, even when you haven't consciously decided what to search for. Wouldn't you welcome that kind of assistance? reply",

The key is using it to solve problems you actually have, rather than problems you want to have. I was losing track of people's contact details --> I made an addressbook in obsidian. I wanted to track my exercise to find out how much I was running each week --> make graphs And so on.  Your obsidian should get a bit messy before you try to impose order on it.  Use it to solve a problem badly (Just writing down how far I run in a daily diary note) then improve (Writing a query to turn all of those notes into a graph). Personally I don't use any AI with my knowledge base. Good searching tools and a little bit of organization are the most useful thing for me. Personally, I think keeping lots of notes/links is a kind of digital hoarding.  Just like real hoarding, it's an emotional problem not an organizational problem.  If you can work out what emotional need hoarding links is fulfilling for you then you're on the way to working out how to get that emotional need fulfilled by something else. reply",

The problem is that I almost never come back to what I have saved. A simple example is YouTube. I save videos to watch later because I am not in the right headspace at the time. Then I avoid them completely. I think part of the resistance is that I know watching them properly will demand attention and probably lead to follow-up work, and I am rarely in a mode where I want that interruption. I have thought about the whole “second brain” idea, but I worry it would just become a dumping ground. Nothing would really resurface when it actually matters. I would mostly be relying on myself to remember that I once made a note about something when I happen to be working on a related problem. Lately I have been thinking about the idea of a passive, radio style feed that summarises the information I have collected and plays it back to me, so I can at least consume each item once. You see those TV shows about people who hoard. They cannot throw things away because they might be important one day. This feels uncomfortably similar. Maybe the real problem is not how we store information. Maybe it is that we aren't filtering hard enough on what is actually worth keeping in the first place. reply",

Filtering: deciding what’s worth keeping so the backlog doesn’t become guilt The “radio-style passive feed” is interesting because it changes the contract: you’re not promising yourself you’ll do deep work, you’re just letting the system replay what you captured at a low cognitive cost. If it worked, it could also become a filter: only the stuff that still feels valuable on playback deserves a second pass.

For me, “listen later” or “read later” only really works when I am in a curious or exploratory headspace. That headspace is not always there. A good example is when I sit down to watch something on a streaming service and end up browsing for ages instead of committing to anything. In theory, that would be a perfect moment to actively review things I have saved, but in practice I am not convinced my neurodiverse brain would reliably cooperate. So to your question, I think I would lean much more toward a context-based mode than a time-based one. A fixed daily slot would quickly turn into another obligation. A lightweight “I am in curiosity mode right now” switch feels closer to how my brain actually works, especially if the radio-style playback keeps the cost of re-entry low. reply",

It’s also great for reference material (what was that long command SQL query I use). But yes it’s also a graveyard. - AirTable worked somewhat to keep moving projects forward, without growing unbounded. But only when there is a workflow. That looks like: dump tasks into rows, then create the steps as views of those tasks with different filters. So tasks essentially move systematically from uncategorized, no time estimate, no schedule, to getting tagged with all of that, and then I can narrow it down to see just what’s on the agenda for today’s date. I also have it show the sum of estimated time per date, because I inevitably end up scheduling 30 hours of tasks for a day, so that helps keep me honest on what’s achievable. I did the same thing in Workflowy with custom JavaScript but AirTable seemed more effective for this. Tasks also get linked to project buckets, and I basically then just try to keep every bucket moving forward (don’t let any active bucket get starved). - I could throw all of this into an LLM and have it tell me what I should be working on, remind me about what I’m forgetting, and so on. But I’m basically not interested, because I’d have to give it additional context that would be beyond what I’m interested or allowed to share. Like, I’ll ask a generic question for advice to an LLM but if an LLM is going to remind me to ”call Robert about Project Mayhem , then it needs to know about Robert and Project Mayhem. reply",

          "text": "This is really helpful detail — and I think your Airtable description nails the core: the value isn’t “having tasks”, it’s having a workflow that progressively turns vague items into schedulable commitments, plus capacity constraints so you don’t lie to yourself about time. On the LLM point, I agree with your hesitation. For anything that touches real people/projects, the default needs to be privacy-first: either local-only, or scoped so the model never needs sensitive identifiers. One approach I’m exploring is separating “private entities” from “public knowledge”: let the system operate on generic project states and action types, and only you see the real names. Another is: no pushy assistant at all—just a pull-based daily view that helps you move buckets forward with the workflow you already trust. If you had to pick one improvement that doesn’t require sharing sensitive context, would you want: 1. better workflow scaffolding (turn uncategorized into scheduled + estimated + bucketed faster), or 2. a way to attach lightweight “done/decision logs” back to tasks so the graveyard stops growing?

There is a natural 'pruning' process where I return to notes and realise I need to rework them to make surfacing the information I need easier. I often adjust titles and aliases (and often find I have two notes with similar names that need 'refactoring' to one - but Logseq makes this easy). If I don't find the note straight away I can usually remember adjacent terms to find it, and then when I do, I tag it with the first terms I searched on (as acceptance of the associations my brain had naturally made). I'll keep an eye on your project. What I do struggle with with Logseq is there isn't an easy means to just dump ideas to organise later, partly because the mobile app is so slow. It really needs two UIs that integrate with the same base format for two different modes of note collection. I disagree with others that taking or 'hoarding' notes is more work than its worth. The benefit of being able to dump info quickly and pick it up again and being able to find it easily is so valuable. Sure some notes get written and never see the light of day again, but then they never consume further time because I just don't work on them, but they are there if I need them.

As notes organized by the limited number of well defined rules, they became easy to search and navigate by AI. Claude Code easily finds requested notes, working as advanced search engine, and they became a starting point for \"deep research\"  : find relevant notes, follow links, detect gaps, search internet. Repeat until reach required confidence level. The most advanced workflow so far is combination of TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) + First Principles Framework. Former generates ideas and hypotheses, later validates them and converge on final answer. reply",

Out of curiosity, where does the loop close for you today? After “deep research” produces a conclusion, do you write back into a MOC / decision log / project note, or does it mostly live in chat + commits? I’m exploring a similar loop (context → retrieval → suggestion → human review → write-back) with the same constraint: keep it auditable and reversible (diff-friendly).

          "text": "As mentioned in my current Ask HN post, the product is indeed not yet finalized or launched. The envisioned product, Concerns, acts as a bridge, linking your current concerns and target tasks to your knowledge base/resource repository and action list (which could be to-do lists, calendars, etc.), forming an organic closed-loop system. Using target/active projects within Concerns as triggers, it retrieves relevant information from your resource repository. It proactively pushes solutions, plans, and suggestions for users to filter. Selected items then enter the user's action list. The goal is to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in a lightweight manner, without altering existing habits for using resource repositories or action lists. This idea stems from my own pain points, and I genuinely hope that while solving my own issues, it might also address broader needs. Regarding your response: It's interesting that AI tagging primarily aids by adding extra searchable keywords. However, I'd prefer broader content and semantic search/matching capabilities without relying solely on tags—though tagging remains a viable implementation approach.\nThanks for the mymind reference—I'll explore it.

I also like the idempotency/provenance angle (unique IDs/links, checkpointing) and the “commit processing” workflow — that’s a concrete example of turning ongoing work into structured, queryable knowledge without a ton of manual ceremony. Curious: in practice, what improved your quality the most — schema validation catching broken links/types, or constraining the entity set so the agent can’t invent structure? Also, do you find yourself actually using the query language day-to-day, or is it mostly agent-driven retrieval? I’m exploring a similar closed-loop (context → retrieval → suggestion → human review → write-back) and summarized my angle in my HN profile/bio if you want to compare approaches. reply",

Your environment is a good reminder that “enterprise-ready” integrations are a different game. If you could improve your personal workflow, what would save you the most time: pulling the right Confluence page when a Jira task is active, extracting a short “what’s the current state + next step” from scattered Slack threads, or something else?

The only thing that changes is the OAuth provider configuration (endpoints, secrets, etc.), not the auth flow itself. - The mock lets you specify a user ID / username directly on the sign-in screen, without real credentials or email verification. That makes it usable both for humans testing previews and for agents or automated test suites. - It also lets us simulate third-party identity providers (Google, etc.) without actually integrating with them in previews. Dealing with things like captchas or provider-side enforcement in ephemeral environments is another source of friction we wanted to avoid. It’s not real auth, but it keeps previews fully functional and avoids special-casing large parts of the app just to make OAuth work with dynamic URLs. reply",

Meaning: instead of trying to authenticate to the preview app, make the preview app only reachable via an encrypted application-layer channel. The \"authentication\" becomes having the encryption key to that channel. For AI agents, this could simplify things: Agent generates an encryption key when spinning up preview\nPreview app runs in isolated network (e.g., behind a customized Envoy proxy doing application-layer encryption without PKI/TLS)\nAgent communicates with preview over the secure channel\nNo OAuth redirect URLs needed at all The pattern we've been using is basically \"encrypted lanes\" between services - each preview gets its own lane(s), fully ephemeral. When the preview dies, the lane disappears. Main downside is this doesn't help if you need humans to access the previews with their SSO credentials. But for agent-to-preview-app workflows, it's been cleaner than fighting OAuth's assumptions. Curious if you've explored this direction or if there are constraints that make network isolation insufficient? reply",

Are you suggesting to completely disable authentication inside the app and rely only on the encrypted channel? If yes, that’s not always an option — many apps have logic that depends on an authentication context, even in preview environments. If not, how do you translate network-level authentication into app-level authentication? In other words, how does the app know who the caller is, beyond the fact that they can reach it over an encrypted lane? The idea of treating this as a network isolation problem makes sense, but I’m trying to understand how it works when the app itself still expects a real auth context. reply",

          "text": "Good question. To clarify: the app still has its own internal auth \nlogic — we're not bypassing that. The encrypted lane handles connection isolation (who can reach \nthe app), while the app still handles identity (who the user is). For agent-to-app communication specifically, the pattern we use:\n1. Agent passes a short-lived token in the request payload (not URL)\n2. App validates the token against its local auth store\n3. The encrypted lane ensures no one else can intercept/replay that token Let me clarify. I am not suggesting disabling authentication inside the app. I am suggesting a solution is to layer the network isolation + application auth. The secure application layer channel just removes the OAuth redirect dance for machine-to-machine flows. For human access, you'd still need SSO. But once the human is authenticated, the services authenticate to one another (machine-to-machine) also at the application layer (not layers 3/4). Does that make sense for your use case, or are you looking for something \nthat works with human SSO flows too? reply",

If OAuth is already part of the product, switching flows only for preview environments isn’t really an option. It introduces a second auth path that doesn’t exist in production, which adds complexity and creates a risk of auth bugs that only appear later. In practice, teams want previews to exercise the same OAuth flow as prod, not a simplified one. > For redirect URLs, some identity providers let you configure them via an API key. That still means introducing provisioning and deprovisioning steps for every ephemeral environment. For example, platforms like Vercel give you PR-based preview URLs out of the box, but it’s not at all obvious how to automatically add and remove redirect URLs in the IdP for each of those. Auth becomes a special case that needs extra orchestration, while everything else is disposable. > Which resources are protected by OAuth that you want these AI agents to interact with? The issue isn’t agents accessing OAuth-protected resources directly. It’s agents building and testing applications that themselves rely on OAuth. The pain point is getting fully functional ephemeral environments when OAuth assumes static, pre-registered redirect URLs. reply",

This is not how things were in the old days.  Back then we would just show up at a job site and after working for a few weeks go to HR and say \"hey.  I didn't get a check.\"  And then when HR couldn't find your records, they just assumed they were lost somewhere and helpfully set you up as an employee with information you gave them. How you have changed, outlaw sili valley. [Edit]\nSo when I say I have zero iProducts, that's not entirely true.  I do have an old 2015 era iMac.  But the first thing I did with it was put a new hard drive in it and boot up FreeBSD.  And then I installed Linux and installed FreeBSD as a VM under Linux because I have nothing better to do with my time.  And somewhere along the way L4 got wedged in there, because you're not a TRUE power user unless you have L4 running under bhyve under FreeBSD under KVM under linux on hardware the manufacturer would really prefer you just run Mach on.  I am wild.  I am the wind. So I found the old macOS hard drive and installed it.  It really did not want to boot.  It told me so many horrible things when I tried to boot, mostly that I really should visit an apple support web site.  The AppleID I'm trying to recover is the same one I used to create a macOS account with.  I wonder if apple knows I've installed Linux, FreeBSD and L4/Linux on their hardware and have marked my AppleId as \"unholy spawn of Satan\" ?  I guess if the roles were reversed I might think anyone who installed L4 on Apple Hardware is \"not to be trusted.\" Or more seriously...  I wonder if you don't boot macOS or log into macOS with your AppleId every now and again, you go on the \"naughty\" or \"potentially naughty\" list.

The likely issue you’re having on an older Mac and an older macOS is that it has an Apple root certificate that’s now expired and unable to register with either of those things. You’re SOL on anything prior to 10.10 Yosemite…. The apple root certs in 10.10 through 10.15 expired in 2019 and the installers for 10.10 through 10.15 were re-distributed by Apple with root certs expiring in 2029 [1] - (internet recovery should download and reinstall the new updated version with updated root certs if yours shipped with at least 10.10 Yosemite. You have to use the hotkey for internet recovery - not the recovery partition on your HDD) However….. OpenCore patcher will even let you install Tahoe, which doesn’t have this problem and will even get updates for another …(?) it’s the last Intel version , so whenever Apple says to hell with Intel I guess.

          "text": "Update... After a bit of work, I was able to boot the old hard drive with macOS and tried to log into apple services.  Of course it rejected my existing AppleId password, but this time with a working iMac, I asked it to send a reset code to my iMac. It seemed to think it sent one to my iMac, but nothing ever showed up.  The internet says it should have showed up on my iMac's screen or in the upper right corner of the screen.  No dice. This is similar to what happened at the Apple Store when we tried the \"use someone else's iProduct\" to reset the password.  The login page seemed to think it had sent a PIN, but it never showed up at the end device. I suspect that because I'm in the iForgot 24 hour cool down period, nothing is going to work.  They claim they will send instructions to my phone (I hope they realize my phone doesn't have iMessage) in 15 hours for what to do while waiting 30 or 90 days to try the reset again. This sort of reminds me when we got bought out and we had problems with our dev certificate.  We had released a couple versions of \"iFoo\" using our domain \"foo.com\".  Then we got bought out by bar.com and wanted to release future versions of iFoo under bar.com branding.  When we eventually got ahold of a human, they said we would have to re-release iFoo as iBar and re-submit it as a new app.  We eventually did this, but they responded that iBar was confusingly similar to an existing app called iFoo and they wouldn't allow it to be released in the app store.  Then they revoked the foo.com dev cert because of shinanigans.  When we tried to explain to them that we were following the instructions they had given us (and sending them emails and screenshots where they told us what to do,) they closed the support ticket and revoked bar.com's dev cert as well. I think Apple processes work very well for the usual case, but they don't think through some of the corner cases. The irony is the role I was attempting to apply for was one that would (partially) oversee working out these corner cases and what Apple should be doing in those situations.  I was invited to apply for this position explicitly because I had encountered similar problems in the past. My suspicion is I'll have a 30 day wait at the end of the initial iForgot 24 hour cool down.  If I'm still looking for a job in 30 days, I'll probably still submit my resume.  It seems that Apple really needs some help in this area. But I applied for a job in '93 and didn't get it and I've been told you're only allowed to apply to Apple once (despite having worked on the Qualcomm baseband processor in the original iPhone and as a contractor in the very early days of macontosh.)  And I'm sure they wouldn't be happy about me talking publicly about identity management corner cases.  I suspect the chance they would really care to hire me is fairly low. But if anyone from Apple ever reads this, feel free to contact me if you need more details on what inputs I provided to your system and what the responses were. reply",

          "text": "Another Update... at the end of the iforgot process, Apple is supposed to send you an update within 24 hours as to what the disposition of your password reset request will be.  In the past, if you opt not to receive a PIN via a registered iProduct, I've seen them say \"we're going to wait 30 days and then allow you to reset your password.\"  I imagine this is to discourage \"bad actors\" from launching massive efforts of password resetting.  If a bad guy was able to convince Apple that they were the TRUE owner of an account, maybe that would give them an advantage in stealing services or user data.  So sure, introducing a waiting time is not the worst idea in the world. About 15 hours ago, I went through the process again and the response was (and I paraphrase) \"tsk. tsk. do not annoy us with your password reset attempts.  we're going to tell you more about how to recover in 15 hours.\"  Again... annoying, but not horrible.  If we're trying to make things difficult for bad actors, this isn't that big of an annoyance. But at the end of the 24 hour waiting period, I still hadn't received an email from Apple at either of the email accounts I had used while trying to reset my AppleId.  (The first is the one the AppleId was explicitly tied to and the second was an alt I use mostly for newsletters and subscribing to web site updates I'm halfway interested in.  I used that because I couldn't remember if I had ever told Apple about that address.)  And that seemed frustrating.  You told me you were going to send me info about resetting my password, but you've welched on the deal. And then I had a disturbing thought... Several years ago I created an AppleId with my work phone and a completely different throw-away gmail address.  After digging up the password for that account, I logged in and sure enough... there's the email from Apple. The only thing I can think is Apple tied my IP Address or location to all three email addresses involved and somehow conflated them together.  I send a reset request from me@not-a-gmail-domain.com and get a response on havent_used_this_address_in_a_year@gmail.com.  That is very, very weird. But the good news is Apple says I only have to wait 7 days to reset the password on this account. I've been thinking about getting back into writing code for the PinePhone I bought a few years ago.  Maybe I will get a pre-paid t-mob or mint sim and try to create a new AppleId at a coffee shop on the far side of town. I can't say this has filled me with a great deal of optimism.  Obviously this isn't happening very often and I'm a corner case.  Otherwise we would surely have heard from thousands of people saying \"I can't log into my Apple account!\"  I'm also sure that when the Apple people were thinking through the process flows, they didn't assume I might try to reset my password while in the 24 hour iForgot wait state. I had been a registered Apple Developer since the late 80s, though the email address in question was only attached to my dev account since around 2006.  AppleIds as we know them have gone through changes... 2FA... removing questions... adding the ability to reset from an iProduct.  My guess is my id was generated shortly after AppleIds became a thing.  Then I stopped using it for a while and they changed the schema of the database holding AppleID details and maybe I didn't log in during some critical time frame.  Then I tried to log in and got marked as a bad guy trying to attack the security of Apple's user credential integrity.  I'm not... but of course, if I was I wouldn't admit it. In any event, I'm sure my original AppleId is hopelessly horked.  And that id was tied to the mobile number I've had since 1998.  I suspect if I try to use that number again, apple will take a look at my IP geolocation, match it to previous attempts to recover the password and assume I'm again a bad guy trying to do bad things.  If this hypothesis is correct, maybe my neighbors will have problems registering iProducts. Apple can, of course, do whatever the heck it wants.  I suspect they don't care enough to modify their processes because the number of people wedged in this state are vanishingly small.  Millions (billions?) of AppleIds have been registered.  Who cares if some dude from Seattle can't ever access Apple services with email or phone identifiers they want to use. I suspect the answer to this is going to be: a) spin up an entirely new email address.  I don't think apple will have a problem with me using gmail as I'm sure they have millions of customers that already use it. b) get a new phone number.  Like I said, I was thinking about doing some coding on my PinePhonePro, so that's not a completely bad idea. c) go across town to a coffee shop (or maybe the Apple store, do they have free wifi there?) and register a new AppleId. d) NEVER FORGET THE PASSWORD I USED. e) NEVER USE THAT AppleId AT MY HOME. This is probably overkill, but Apple has successfully hidden the details of their user credential processes and I have to imply state and state transitions from their public behaviour.  I really don't want to spent too much more time on this.  (Now that I think about it... the problems we had with our dev certificate a few years back absolutely had the same \"actual state is hidden behind an opaque wall of process\" characteristic.) All these problems are, I'm sure, Apple's way of limiting the effectiveness of social engineering attacks.  And that's something I can respect.  But if you're the by-catch of Apple's dragnet, it's absolutely annoying. reply",

Elaboration, with too much pop culture...  ;-) When you use cash, for example, you're using capabilities. You can hand out exactly $3.50 to the Loch Ness Monster[1], and no matter what, he's not going to be able to leverage that into taking out your entire bank balance, etc. The current \"ambient authority\" system is like handing the Loch Ness Monster your wallet, and HOPING he only takes $3.50. Another metaphor is power outlets, which limit how much of the power from the grid makes it to your device. The current system is much like the electric - i - cal, at the Douglass house in Green Acres.[2] The point is, you can run any program you want, and give it only the files you want, and nothing else, by default in such a system. For the user, it really doesn't have to seem that different, they already use dialog boxes to select files to open and save things, they could use a \"power box\"[3] instead, which looks the same, except then the OS enforces their choices.

After all, despite what tech folk think, most people really dislike change. So we'll probably stick with what we've got until AI is truly empowered to change things, which we are probably a decade away from. At that point, it is far more likely that AI will be taking in full audio, video, and data from your environment, and will know you well enough that the mundane tasks will just happen, without need for any UX at all. Maybe a small device for you to tweak things and control non-standard tasks. But again, that is a decade off, if not two. We're currently headed into the first downturn of the AI-driven world, when the hype dies, people really spell out the problems, platforms realize that most people don't want generative AI, and all of this quiets down, taking a back burner for 7-10 years while the research advances to move beyond today's problems and evolves into what people might actually want. reply",

AR/VR development in this space is a massive timesink for all the wrong reasons.\nHardware vendors absolutely suck here. Everyone is openly or quietly dreaming of the vertically integrated 'app-store tax' being their real source of revenue rather than selling devices. This means that if you don't want to fuzz around with half-baked proprietary SDKs that break more often than they do what they're supposed to, you get to sit around reverse engineering. As fun as that can be, it's much less so when that is not what you set out to be doing. Half my electronics 'donation boards bin' is discarded HMDs and input devices by now.

          "text": "The honest answer: 90% of marketing is consistency, not brilliance. What's worked for me: 1. Be genuinely helpful first. Before you promote anything, spend a month just answering questions in communities where your users hang out. Not pitching, just helping. This builds credibility and teaches you what people actually struggle with. 2. Build in public. Share your process, not just the finished product. People love following a journey. Weekly updates on LinkedIn, a Show HN when you hit a milestone, short posts about what you learned. 3. Email still works if you do it right. Collect emails from day one. A simple \"get notified when we launch\" form captures people who are actually interested. Then nurture them with value, not spam. 4. The 100-user challenge. Instead of trying to reach everyone, focus on getting 100 people to really use and love your product. Those 100 become your advocates and do the marketing for you. 5. Don't spend money on ads until you can articulate exactly who converts and why. Ads amplify what's already working. They don't create product-market fit. The pessimistic comment about marketing being dead is half-right. Lazy promotion is dead. But genuinely helping people in the right places, over time, still works.

Fanout × retries × context growth compounds in ways that linear cost models completely miss. The fix that worked for us: treat budget as a hard constraint, not a target. When you're approaching limit, degrade gracefully (shorter context, fewer tool calls, fallback to smaller model) rather than letting costs explode and cleaning up later. Also worth tracking: the 90th percentile request often costs 10x the median. A handful of pathological queries can dominate your bill. Capping max tokens per request is crude but effective. reply",

One thing we do in enzu is make “budget as constraint” executable: we clamp `max_output_tokens` from the budget before the call, and in multi-step/RLM runs we adapt output caps downward as the budget depletes (so it naturally gets shorter/cheaper instead of spiraling). When token counting is unavailable we explicitly enter a “budget degraded” mode rather than pretending estimates are exact. Also agree p90/p95 cost/run matters more than averages; max-output caps are crude but effective.

It seems like AI is not going to go away, and instead of building reliable software, managers seem to push people to use AI more, as long as they ship products. Everything else is being destroyed by AI: art, music, books, personal websites. Why read a blog post, when Google AI Summary can just give you the summary? Why read a book, when you can just get AI summary of it? Why pay artists for music, when you can just generate endless amount of AI music?<p>And even things like \"doing day to day chores\" are being automated away with tools like AI assistants. The only thing you are left to do is to eat and take a sh*t throughout the day. How should people make money? No idea, as in the \"prosperous future\", everything is replaced by AI.<p>So my question HN: What's the point anymore? Why keep going and where to?</p></p></div>",

Becoming a successful writer / musician, is already hard. With software, it was easier, but in my opinion, it will become hard as well. There will be individuals in the software development who are like Taylor Swift, because they know how LLMs work, and how to optimize them to squeeze one more KPI. The rest will just be nobodies. And sure, if you think you are an extraordinary person, or you were born in the right environment, then you probably don't have to worry. But I'm an average Joe, who wants to live an average Joe's life, but it's being taken away from me.

For creatives who are dedicated to their craft and are not in it for mass-market leverage, this is fine, it's going to be a filter.

And while sure, merit / good taste are important, but if you look at the mainstream it's filled with average. Now, from the consumer side you can claim \"what do you care about the mainstream, just look for good taste, and you will find it\", and I agree with you. But I do not speak about the consumer side, but rather the producer side. As a producer, I want to produce \"good taste\", but if there is very little demand for good taste things, I might struggle to sustain myself while producing based on merit. In the end, the reason enshittification exists, is because \"good taste\" stuff became too popular and the authors decided to capitalize on it (can't blame them when you have a mortgage to pay, and family to feed), and turn it into \"mainstream crap\". I guess the point I'm trying to make, is that creating good taste is not easy. And it will become even harder as the mainstream will expand and capture AI generated content, leaving people who believe in creation based on merit, fighting for the crumbs. reply",

So, either work to create that 1% of interesting content, or filter/curate to find it. I will note that there is a _lot_ of interesting old work which has dropped off the radar --- Hermann Hesse's _Magister Ludi_/_The Glass Bead Game_ was a book which greatly inspired me in my youth (arguably, it's why I use programming tools such as: https://github.com/derkork/openscad-graph-editor ) --- read it? reply",

There's more than you can ever listen to. You'll get tired of music as a whole before that.

          "text": "I feel exactly like OP, I was visiting Ask before actually making my own \"Whats the point?\" post. I think the real issue is this huge community of people who have gone completely gone awry with using LLMs in their own loops and constantly posting and talking about it. I see dozens of people on HN just posting about how amazing it is to write/compose software now. They're making more software than ever and having the time of their lives. When I read those and I actually go and explore that software they're just OSS tools, I wonder why would anyone want to use this? If everyone was doing as they were they're just asking their LLM to do it instead of looking out for a tool. Even better they'll just ask their LLM to make a tool to accomplish whatever those authors are building. Then it's this whole new religion of human out of the loop. You feel like you've either gone stale or insane because every one now says adding human into the loop worsens the productivity gains from a model. I highly disagree, I haven't used a single model that handles a substantially complex task flawlessly. If you mention anything about that people don't shutup about harnesses. Don't get me wrong, I use LLMs, I use them quiet frequently. However it's this obsessive attitude towards them that makes it impossible to get funding or research for anything that's not at least tangentially related them. It's completely burned me out professionally, academically and psychologically. reply",

Doesn't matter how much technology there is, people need to live somewhere and will adapt by finding a place they can optimize for happiness. It'll be like starting a game of Civilization from scratch but with all the advanced technologies intact. People may also go back to the early-human modes of survival of the first-nations groups. Digital and electric technologies aren't healthy things to be around. Do you want to live in the range of a 10G antenna or near a massive solar array? The naturalists may end up happier and healthier than the tech-heads. It's about taking/using what works for you and leaving the rest. Worth noting that if someone really had an answer to your questions, would they state the truth here? How do you know the robots won't come and just kill us all when they can because we have no power/influence/value? Where will people migrate to in order to avoid that? Antarctica? The moon? Underground to avoid weaponized satellites? Conscience and consciousness really needs to grow with technology, really that's the challenge of today. Always has been.

It was pleasant, and I could feel that every hit really meant something to shape the future of the stone, and thereby the building. Customers and contractors alike told me how great it was to see me work that stone. So I kept swinging that hammer. Then I was told about some electrical chisel that was supposed to make my life better. Sure, I made more money, but the work was gone. It just shakes; it doesn't vibrate. I get numb, not proud. I have to take breaks, because my hands can't handle it. It's awful. What's the point, I asked? But then I started talking to my colleagues during those breaks. I even discovered I had a relative in common with one. While chipping away at stone, no one ever wanted to stand close to me, and I had spent all this time proudly creating stone chips all day long! I still chip away at stone sometimes, but only when there's no one else around to talk to at breaktime. --- You are not going to be able to stop change.

I'm barely touching current \"AI\" other than certain bits of code completion that are on by default in VS and are the right mix of occasionally useful (saving a few tens of keystrokes) and easy to ignore when not. When it gets to the point where I can't compete without using LLMs heavily, I'll have to do something else. Perhaps wait tables somewhere with Spanish customers as I'm trying to learn the language, it won't be much or a pay cut because by the point where someone of my years can't compete at all, almost anyone will be able to do a shite job with LLMs so programming will be heading towards being a minimum-wage job anyway. > Everything else is being destroyed by AI: art, music, books, personal websites. Yours doesn't have to be. I started writing bits to go online again after many years not bothering. It isn't intended for public consumption, I'm deliberately doing nothing that would be called SEO in fact I'm going anti-SE in some ways, though it isn't hidden should I chose to pass a link to someone or if they decide to pass it on further. It is intended for me and a select few, if someone else finds it somehow and likes it then good the them, and much of the point of making it is the joy of making something. Everyone else using LLMs isn't going to take that from me. > Why read a blog post, when Google AI Summary can just give you the summary? Because the summary may be wrong, or technically correct but with entirely the wrong tone or missing key details a summary should have. Or because you want to read the post - you don't have to use the summary. I don't read the summary generated as part of most searches these days, reading them is optional. I don't make effort to stop them being made though (using porn mode, adding “fuck”/“fucking” to search terms, etc.) - hopefully making them waste resources on generating things that are never used will et noticed and they'll ramp that down a bit at least for accounts like mine. > Why read a book, when you can just get AI summary of it? Before AI, did you just skip to the last few pages to see what happened? If not, then just keep reading like you did before. Avoiding the slop books that are flooding the market ATM might be more of a concern, but there was plenty written before the LLM bubble started to keep you in things to read for a lifetime. > The only thing you are left to do is to eat and take a sh t throughout the day.* Other hobbies. I like trail running (or if in a slower mood, country walking), AI isn't going to stop me doing that. HEMA and other activities with friends too. > How should people make money? No idea, as in the \"prosperous future\", everything is replaced by AI. That is a completely different question to the rest where you are asking about things that you would do for enjoyment, and is a bigger societal and philosophical concern than I have time to chew on right now… > What's the point anymore? Same as it was before: do what you need to do to survive, then do what you need to do to enjoy any remaining time after that. Perhaps I'm helped here by being back on the up after a couple of years recovering from proper burnout: I know the way things are going won't make me feel worse than that, and I survived that. Current politics and other social issues away from tech on the other hand… > Why keep going? When all hope feels truly lost, at least keep going out of spite. > Why keep going and where to?

I see it on macOS, Linux (Mint), mobile phones and probably Windows too (though i haven't used windows in a while).<p>Is this a cleaner look? I have always loved visible scroll bars because they act as useful  guides for where I am on a page and how much content remains and just easy to drag. Now you have to hover over it first.<p>I am curious what UX changes have stood out to you lately, for better or worse.. Maybe some designers reading this forum will take notes.</p></p></div>",

          "text": "I designed and 3D-printed my own slide rule to help me play Balatro! Balatro is a roguelike survival game where you need to multiply \"chips\" and \"mult\" together to meet a requirement each round. You get three chances to draft enough resources to survive. I designed my own slide rule to help with the mental multiplication - most of the fun of the game comes from the mechanics being slightly obscured from the player. Since I designed this slide rule myself, I was able to make a couple unconventional design choices that fit my needs. For instance, mine has three octaves so it can represent numbers within the ones, thousands, or millions' range, for example; no need to track arbitrary powers of ten. Since it's a rotary rule, it wraps around. Eg. 353×24 shows on the device as 8.47, so you can think of it as 8.47 thousand, for example. Holding a physical object in my hands while playing helps more than I thought it would. Should I take a card that increases chips by 600 or increases mult by 1.3×? Do I need to take a card to clear the blind in the short term, or do I have enough resources to draft a slower card that will scale better over time? Even just looking at how densely packed the marks are on the \"Chips\" side vs the \"Mult\" side of the device gives a visceral physical sense of what my build needs to focus on. Pictures and .STL: https://www.printables.com/model/1026662-jimbos-rotary-slide... Github repository: https://github.com/gcr/balatro-slide-rule The actual plotting code used Marimo notebooks, which host a python in your browser via WASM. Take a look here: https://marimo.app/l/4i15d7 I entered it in Printables’ educational tools competition but the other entries were cooler. Maybe HN might like it. :-) reply",

It can reliably get me 2 sig figs, and a decent guess at a third.  But… if I think about it for a minute, I can usually get that in my head anyway.  Being able to setup a ratio is great though for unit conversions and things. It’s also really good for answering that question when driving where you’re like, ok if I go 10mph faster how much sooner will I get there which is otherwise hard to do mentally. Most of the benefit of using a slide rule in my experience comes not from using it, but from thinking LIKE you’re going to use a slide rule.   You learn to freely use scientific notation with ease, and mental estimation to get the order of magnitude right. And just my 2 cents, but circular slide rules are where it’s at. reply",

It felt cool being the only kid at the school with a laptop, but the slide rule languished in a box under my bed until I got it out and figured out how to work it in college. I wish I'd figured it out sooner because it gave a more visceral understanding of the mathematical relationships that I'd been lacking before.  Granted, the slide rule has sat mostly idle since then, but it was definitely worth it. I'd encourage you to give it a go. reply",

To illustrate, suppose someone tries to multiply 123 and 987 with a calculator but incorrectly punches in 123 and 187. My hypothesis is they'll look at the result but won't suspect any problem. The equivalent operation on a slide rule requires fewer physical actions and hence, is less error prone. Do you think there's anything to this hypothesis?

Of course, you can have double or triple redundancy to make such cases vanishingly rare, but still — it’s nice to have a backup that relies on nothing outside your control. Some of it is pure nostalgia, though, I’ll admit. It a way to honor how people solved similar problems in the past. In the 18th century a sextant plus accurate chronometer or lunar distance table was one of the pivotal technologies of the age; you could use it to pinpoint your location on the boundless ocean within a few miles. That demands respect, and it’s also just really cool it was possible in an era before electricity and radio. reply",

Heh heh, I was in the Sailing Cub in high school, and our Sailing Master (RIP Master Gibb) said literally the same thing about learning to navigate with sextant and chronometer even though we never sailed out of sight of land. It was all about deep respect for the history and tradition of being a Mariner. Now I fly gliders, \"the purest form of flight,\" and while you can get a glider with electrically operated landing gear, a jet sustainer engine, and digital navigation and flight computing devices... There is something extraordinarily pure about the exercise of flying with everything electrical turned off (except for the transponder and radio for safety). And even purer... Flying with covered instruments so we don't even get analogue airspeed and altitude. Circling back to slide rules... Sometimes we crave that simplicity, that direct experience of a thing. reply",

Asked him about it and he joked that he didn't trust those transistors before explaining that it's just muscle memory to him and while a calculator would be faster he'd still earn the same per hour. Apparently I was the first to ask him in over a decade as everyone had moved on to do stuff in software and no one was pushing him to use a calculator anymore. Interns didn't inquire because they thought it must be some esoteric/religious practice. Last I heard he was still working there, management asked him to stay on past retirement age for his invaluable skillset. While its probably some other skill I just like to imagine the suits in a meeting where they decided to keep him on for this particular \"skill\" that no one else in the company had anymore. reply",

Each time I post here I get ~500 emails, almost all are low effort that don't meet anything I am looking for, sometimes for months in the future. I expect it to be even worse as LLMs gain traction. I've hired 4 people from past posts (check my history if you want!), but it can take some time dig through everyone so I apologize to legitimate interests. reply",

We negotiate the right to open source all our client code, maintain a handful of popular libraries, and our engineers contribute to Django core. We sponsor PyCon, DjangoCon, and Django Girls because we're invested in the ecosystem we build on. We're looking for software engineers who value software design, system architecture, and collaboration. You should be comfortable with about half of these areas and eager to learn the rest: web application security, relational database design (PostgreSQL, beyond \"SELECT *...\"), Django internals, React, and distributed systems. What you'll actually work on: complex state machines for financial workflows, multi-tenant architectures with row-level security, custom database functions when the ORM isn't enough, and React frontends that handle real-time data without being a mess of useEffect hooks. We're a small team where you'll own features end-to-end (database design to React components) and have opportunities to shape technical decisions. You'll get paid to write source code with a team that practices empathy and values work-life balance.

I’m a systems builder (CS/infra founder; shut down my last startup) who spent the past two years going deep on foundational math that most engineers (and I guess many mathematicians) tend to ignore, largely at an nLab level, because standard abstractions stop composing. I’m working toward a small, private apply-focus lab to bridge native CS intuition (computation, scale, systems) with structural, information-theoretic mathematics. The focus is composability, learning, universality, and complexity, with the intent to build, not publish. The approach is unconventional, but intentional: staying close to real systems while reworking foundations when existing methods stop composing. Looking for a self-funded generalist comfortable crossing CS, math, and theory that's interested in structure, information, ethics, and long-horizon work. reply",

We focus on hard technical problems (anti-bot, browser automation, fingerprinting, captcha solving). We are hiring a senior engineer to take ownership of our core platform: scraper orchestrator, billing & payments, customer dashboard, and parts of our AI-based captcha tooling. This is a hands-on role with real ownership: architectural decisions, setting standards, and gradually mentoring other engineers. The role is very full-stack (infra, backend, frontend). Stack includes TypeScript (most backend & web), Rust (new backend services, migration in progress), Go (Android scraper), PyTorch (captcha solvers), PostgreSQL, Redis, GitHub Actions, Ansible, Ubuntu Linux, bare-metal Hetzner servers. We are profitable, demand is growing fast, and engineering bandwidth is the main bottleneck. Team is small (3 engineers), fully remote, mostly async (we expect ~4h overlap with UTC+8).

Our inbound applications are reviewed by humans. With apologies that our first interaction requires this silliness: including one of the 7-digit numbers from the \"ROS Calculator\" on Veho's website in the appropriate box will heavily bias me towards believing you are a human being.

Our canvas is zoom-to-code, and shows data on overlays from all of the git repos in your company. LLMs go through the codebase and extract the architecture. We provide clarity when it's most needed: re-orgs, onboarding, explaining the tech stack at board meetings. Or just being stuck in your IDE and want to ask your team mate a question. We'd like to do to large org codebases what Figma did to design. Comper needs someone that can build revolutionary UIs and go where no man has gone before. We are hiring a software engineer and a genius designer (with ideally some engineering prowess). Our UI is the core of our product: a zoomable canvas that has all your code, documentation and diagrams on it. We have a long way ahead and need serious thinking to make sure we explain the software stack as simple as can be. I'm the founder & CTO. We just raised a pre-seed and are now with 5 people.

Our motto is \"by teens, for teens\" and we operate with radical trust and transparency. Every month, thousands of projects come through our You Ship We Ship programs. Program authors do the primary reviews. We need someone to QA the reviewers — a second set of eyes who can tell us: are they making good calls? Catching the fake projects? Being too harsh on legitimate ones? Responsibilities: - Spot-check approved projects (random sampling) - Audit reviewer consistency and catch patterns - Define what \"high quality\" actually means and document it - Train program authors to make better decisions - Handle appeals and investigations -  Build systems that work at 100k projects/year You'll still do plenty of hands-on review — you can't spot-check effectively without understanding the projects deeply. But your mission is ensuring the integrity of the entire process, not being the bottleneck for each submission. $55-70k. 4 weeks PTO. Health/dental/vision.

Website: https://hadid.dev Résumé/CV: https://hadid.dev/resume/ GitHub: https://github.com/mhadidg Email: career+hn @ [my website domain] --- Hi! I'm a backend engineer (~8 YOE) with strong backend & DevOps experience and decent frontend skills. Looking for a backend or backend-leaning full-stack role. I worked at Automattic (US), the company behind WordPress; fully remote, async teams across the globe. I've been part of teams focused on speed and rapid iteration, and I've also worked on high-quality systems where long-term maintainability and reliability matter the most. I believe this mix of experience has helped me develop a good sense of where each fits best and has enabled me to adapt quickly based on context and requirements. I've built and maintained time-sensitive, high-throughput, distributed services (millions of ops daily) and owned features and small- to mid-sized projects end-to-end from design to deployment. I do my best working autonomously, and I like to think of myself as a generalist. Most of my career has been in large enterprises (7+ YOE), but I've also done a fair amount of freelance work (around 1 YOE) for clients. I have a couple of small open-source projects on GitHub. reply",

I am looking for my break to get into the contemporary software development scene, after having previously developed software (primarily Windows utilities) on my own and having dabbled in various technologies. This break will most likely take the form of a tech support, documentation, or QA role for a software development team. An entry-level developer position would be even better, from a company that will have a bit of patience as I rapidly level up to their contemporary technology of choice. I like both the aesthetic, UI, and social challenges of frontend development as well as the complex, very technical puzzles involved in backend development. It is very easy for me to be fascinated by cool technologies, both old and new. Another appealing option for me would be to be involved with AI model training and evaluation. I've had several years experience working remotely with international teams, though in primarily non-technical roles. I look forward to making first contact with your world! reply",

I’ve learned a lot about a lot. I craft user interfaces from conception to deployment, with a solid understanding of the backend. That full-system view helps me shape features with foresight well beyond the UI. My design decisions are grounded in Jobs-to-be-Done thinking and product metrics, ensuring every feature solves a meaningful problem. By bridging design, code, and product, I experiment, measure outcomes, and optimise for both user experience and business goals. Ideally looking for a design engineering role where I get to go beyond making pictures of software, but build software alongside developers (in production).

My experience has been quite broad in that time but my recent focuses in my spare time have been Python/Flask, and C/C++ (for a homebrew project on an old console that I enjoy contributing to) but my initial experience was with Java; the first thing I wrote was a CraftBukkit plugin that ended up getting over a million downloads. I'd consider myself very good at quickly familiarising myself with unfamiliar frameworks/languages, so even if it's something I'm not experienced in, I would be more than willing to do a take-home, or something similar (which I enjoy, esp. if it's something new to me). Looking for and would be grateful for any opportunities, includingr  non-SWE, e.g. I.T., or even something non-technical if your company is hiring for other roles. I do not use LLMs for any work or projects of mine, or prose I've written (personal preference, not a moral viewpoint).

LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tbordenca/ Email: bordenca[dot]tobias[at]gmail[dot]com --- I’m a former software engineer turned Product Manager, with ~7 years in a single B2B fintech/wealth-tech company, growing from intern → engineer → product owner → product manager. Most recently, I owned a flagship wealth-management platform used by tier-1 banks across Europe and Asia. I worked at the intersection of product strategy, deep technical constraints, and regulatory reality (MiFID II, LSFin, data protection). Highlights include: - Leading multi-team, multi-module roadmaps in high-stakes enterprise environments - Overhauling a portfolio optimizer end-to-end (methodology + UX), contributing ~€2M ARR - Acting as product/technical counterpart for large banking clients and supporting RFPs I’m comfortable going from problem discovery with demanding stakeholders to concrete execution with engineers, and I’m particularly effective where products are complex, technical, or regulated. Looking for PM or TPM roles in Switzerland or remote, ideally where strong technical depth and real product ownership matter. reply",

You can also visit github.com/<hnusername>.) I'm not actively looking (hence why my resume link is obfuscated like that) but I'm at least interested in getting a feel for the market right now. That said, I'm willing to consider a position with a great fit for my skill set and career goals. Here's my pitch: I have experience in a multitude of industries and positions. From improving legacy infra and processes in an established telco company to scaling a fast-moving startup from 200K to 2M users. In my free time, I love writing Code That Is Poetry but day-to-day I am not an idealist engineer who doesn't compromise. Well-engineered code is clean and correct but correct above all else. Oh, also, I'm great at writing documentation. I consider myself introverted but apparently my communication skills are above average for Software Engineers. I also pride myself on my humility and modesty. I'm currently a backend engineer developing features and improving infra for an online game with millions of daily active users. I'd love to explore other technical positions in the games industry short of joining a AAA studio because (a) I don't want to crunch and (b) my skill set does not lay that way; other tech-creative industries would also appeal to me! Another particular interest is in B2C businesses where the 'C' is software developers.

Track record: time.gov (1999, still running), SpicyNodes (40M users), ProstateCalculator (1.5M patients navigating treatment decisions). Last decade running a word games studio built on a semantic knowledge graph—120M+ connections across 1.7M words, NSF funded ($295K SBIR). Game design taught me what most product teams skip: progressive disclosure, intrinsic motivation, making the 100th use as rewarding as the first. I apply that to software that isn't games. Judge for IGF, MagFest, CODiE, GEE, Serious Games. Looking for: Product/design leadership at Series A–C companies (10–50 people). Developer tools, learning platforms, knowledge products, brain health, creative AI. Teams where I can lead and ship, not just roadmap. Products that need to feel less like enterprise Java circa 2003.

Until earlier this year, I worked at Uber as a Developer Advocate for Cadence — an open-source workflow orchestration engine powering 12B+ workflows/month. I partnered with dozens of teams to support adoption, scale distributed systems, and troubleshoot production issues. Cadence is a key component of Uber's Michelangelo ML platform, and I worked closely with AI/ML teams to integrate it into fault-tolerant pipelines. I also supported internal model training efforts, including fine-tuning LLMs to answer Cadence-related questions and building systems to classify and prioritize developer support. At DoorDash, I contributed to the migration from Django to Kotlin microservices on the Drive Merchant Services team, focusing on customer support endpoints. I also designed and implemented a modular refund rules engine for our largest partners, enabling flexible refund logic and supporting internal tooling. I’ve previously built NLP pipelines at Jobscan to match résumés to job descriptions and score resume strength, and earlier, trained models to predict ad performance based on copywriting—my first foray into ML back in 2016. After wrapping up at Uber, I'm now excited to return to a hands-on engineering role with a collaborative, technically strong team and a path toward engineering leadership (EM or CTO). I'm particularly interested in infrastructure, developer platforms, and applied ML systems in domains like healthcare, logistics, finance, or defense. Outside of work, I enjoy navigating Puget Sound on my sailboat, wrenching on my motorcycle, and getting curious about obscure systems and trivia. Let’s build something meaningful. reply",

Professionally I worked on the moddio ( https://www.modd.io/ ) game engine (typescript) and SPARQ game engine (c++, to be released) as an engine programmer. I find I enjoy web/typescript more than native/c++ so I would like to return to that space.

I was previously the first product analytics hire at a Vision AI startup, Roboflow. Before that, I co-founded a B2B data operations tool, Shipyard. Earlier in my career, I was the Head of Data Products at PMG Advertising Agency where I built the team from the ground up.

I want to sink my teeth into tough problems, learn new things, and work with interesting and curious people. I'm primarily looking for technical product roles. I enjoy ideating solutions, building MVPs, experimentation, and orchestrating all of the work to achieve a strategic vision. I prefer a roughly 70/30 split between leader/IC. I prefer smaller organizations with the ability to build something from the ground up. Despite my background, I'd like to avoid working in the advertising space. reply",

Email: JamesCarnley@gmail.com I am a Full-Stack Engineer with 10+ years of experience and a heavy lean into DevOps. I enjoy building applications end-to-end—from the front-end components down to the server infrastructure and deployment pipelines. Currently, I am developing the Ethereum File System (EFS), an open-source project where I wear both hats: As a Developer: I architected a decentralized application using EAS, Solidity, TypeScript and Web Components, solving complex state management issues in a resource constrained environment. As an Ops Engineer: I help run the underlying Ethereum network, using Prometheus and Grafana for observability and practicing chaos engineering to ensure node reliability. Previously, I spent a decade at Epic Systems working on enterprise healthcare software. My work there involved modernizing legacy web platforms (C#/.NET) and managing large-scale server integrations, ensuring federated code worked reliably across varied and rigid enterprise environments. I’m looking for a role where I can be useful across the stack, whether that means shipping features, improving build tools, or stabilizing infrastructure. reply",

When I'm away from it, there's a wonderful emulation of the 15C (and 16C) at https://jrpn.jovial.com . The numeric algorithms behave identically as far as I can tell, and it even includes the back panel (3-dot menu near the logo, then \"Help\"). The visuals make me feel right at home.

To answer the op's question, any RPN calculator is wildly better than the default calculators on things like iOS once you take the time to learn to use it[1].  If you want a good calculator app, Thomas Okken's free42 is a great, free HP42S emulator which runs on iOS.  I still prefer a physical calculator (eg the swissmicros has more screen space so you can see 4 lines of stack and dedicated function buttons) but it's much better than the default. [1] Great support for complex numbers in polar or rectangular form, fewer keypresses for multi-step operations, no ambiguity (whatsoever) about operator order without any need for parentheses, vast number of memory slots (not just one), the ability to write a program to do anything you can do manually on the calculator so you can automate anything you do frequently, numerical integration and root finding etc etc there are many many benefits. reply",

This program is so much more capable (a complete different league) than what every physical calculator that I am aware of has to offer that convenience and handiness of a physical calculator does not matter anymore for the comparison: Wolfram Mathematica is compared to a physical calculator like what a physical calculator is compared to doing all comparisons by hand. reply",

          "text": "Yes, I have a Casio fx-9750GIII and I love it. I still haven't found an Android app or website that can do everything that I need (basic functionality), but in general: - I need physical buttons. I often find that on touchscreens I mistype something and I don't notice. - The history feature. Maybe I want to do a serial task or calculation, and I can just replace/correct one of the formulas in the history and it automatically recalculates all of the expressions that came after it. - I have written some micropython code / utilities for the calculator and I use it all the time. - I don't want to context switch to do a quick calculation. On my PC I have to open up a new terminal or a website (I might be offline, so I have to hotspot and then connect the wifi and ...) and interrupt my existing work or I have to frequently switch between a PDF or latex or whatever that I'm working on. - Typing out `sin` or `np.sin` or `sin^-1` on PC is both longer and more error prone. It gets very frustrating very quickly. - The numerical solver is a godsend. Try solving for the roots of an expression like `xe^x = 10` on your PC without internet. Or with an android application. On my calculator it's just a few dedicated button presses. On the PC, I have to use isympy and typeout `nsolve(Eq(x * exp(x), 10), 1)`, and you wouldn't even get a proper graphical display of the expression while you are typing it. reply",

It has no graphing capability and it's barely programmable, but that's ok, I keep an actual computer nearby for those sorts of things. The calculator keeps earning new batteries bc tinkering with analog circuits I frequently want to evaluate little things like AB/(A+B) or 1/2piF or (1+S)/(1-S), or need the log 10 or square root or the cosine of something. In those circumstances, the calculator's compact form factor is quite convenient, compared to needing two hands at the computer keyboard, or one handedly hunt-pecking said keyboard. As for the mouse, that has to be the slowest, most focus stealing option of them all. The calculator doesn't take much room, so it can be kept within arm's reach without getting in the way, quickly gives me the numbers I need, without demanding I become fully engaged with it. Also, those old HP buttons are just so nice to press, a refreshing break from the dead flat glass you get everywhere else these days. reply",

I was recently in the office of a small company, and I noticed that the bookkeeper had a calculator next to a pile of paper (receipts?) on her desk. She also had a computer in front of her with a spreadsheet on the screen. When I moved here forty-three years ago, it was common to see abacuses used in similar situations. There's still an abacus school [1] not far from where I live, but it's been a long time since I saw one in use. [1] https://maps.app.goo.gl/nvTg4hfSjTcba47c8 reply",

He pointed out that someone who developed that skill could solve problems faster in their head than by reaching for a slide rule, and they wouldn't necessarily be limited to slide rule approximations.  Engineers, accountants, etc. would be more productive by being able to do calculations without having to reach for a slide rule or pencil and paper. [pause for 'slide rule' chuckle] The same applies to \"open calculator app and key the figures in,\" though. I'm not sure that \"user interface\" was a thing back when he wrote that, but that's what he was talking about. reply",

As for why I use them? - They are tactile. - They are forgiving, pushing a button doesn't accidentally swipe to some random app or screen or slide down notifications. - The physical calculator doesn't interrupt my work with a notification or popup. I realize it makes me a boomer, but using modern smartphone interfaces, especially post-home button iOS, feels like interacting with a UI sitting on top of a banana peel. Buttons now require more precise and well-timed touches to activate their actions (eg: the buttons on the lock screen). I frequently find myself accidentally swiping between apps or navigating to new views. I really wish I could go back to the old way of having a singular app be the focus, and having a home button or something I can press to switch between app contexts, without all the easily triggered and hidden gestures. reply",

SIP URIs would let me kinda-sorta communicate with the broader ecosystem, but many phones and software seem to have dropped support for it; only a tiny % of those typically using the PSTN (that is, a \"normal phone\") would be able to call or receive calls to/from my addresses -- but it would be able to be directly and neatly integrated into the email server, which is a big plus.<p>I will probably still implement SIP URIs and VOIP support into the email server on principle, but I wonder if anyone has any alternatives to consider. Ideally, I would be able to communicate on the PSTN, but this seems like a lost cause.<p>Also curious about anyone using VOIP for work whether or not they allow or block SIP URIs from external networks. I maintained our VOIP server at work more than a decade ago, but it was a \"side-project\" due to working at an SMB where I wore many hats and couldn't specialize in anything; I wasn't even aware of SIP URIs at the time.</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I like this quote: > First time founders are obsessed with product. Second time founders are obsessed with distribution. I have personally grown an app from zero to 100k+ users, with no marketing budget. I don't have a magic formula, but i can say in hindsight that the first 5 users were harder to get than the next 999,995. Here was my secret: I begged. Finding 5 people to actually use my product was soooo freakin hard. Once I got to ~100, organic growth started to take over, but things like responding to emails, fixing bugs and looking into new features right away make early users personally like you and more likely to tell their friends. The hard part is finding the right people at the right time. I googled \"Persona email scheduling\" and found https://usepersona.app/ , so I'll assume that is you. I don't know much about your product, but i assume you are targeting people who need to schedule lots of meetings. I have a few notes: 1) Your pricing is crazy. $660/year is a lot for automated meeting scheduling. Your comp should be Calendly which is closer to $10/month. 2) What problem are you trying to solve? Calendly seems pretty close to the perfect solution for one-on-one meetings. This seems to be for scheduling larger groups. Make that clear at the top of the page. If you are directly competing with Calendly, then just make that clear. 3) I'm not the audience, but think about who really has this problem. For me, 90% of my group meetings are scheduled within my company and we use Google calendar to find times that work. I dont do this enough that I'd feel compelled to try out a new product. Sales people schedule lots of 1-on-1 calls, but not sure that group calls is a big issue. So think about who this is really for. In general, just about the only time i will try a new product is if it provokes my curiosity (not gonna happen for a meeting scheduling bot) or it is solving a problem I need solved right now. Some products are really great, but finding the right person at the right time is a huge challenge. This is why I brought up the quote at the beginning. The right product with no distribution is very hard to get off the ground. I'd say that your early goal should be to find power users if possible... if you try to spread too wide of a net, you will probably fail. Better to have a few people who love your app than a larger group of people who think it's nice. 4) Let's say you do get a few users. Well, you are an email scheduling tool, so distribution is actually built on. On your free or basic plans, you can have a banner at the bottom of outgoing emails that says \"This email was drafted by Persona, the tool for automated emails\". Now you have free marketing on every email that goes out. Same way that my calendly link is free marketing for calendly. If people want that banner removed, they can upgrade their plan. Again, take this advice for what it's worth, which is very little, since 1) I dont know your market well, and 2) what worked for me may not work for you. reply",

          "text": "Thanks for your thoughtful reply. I really like that quote -- hopefully I start another company and think about distribution straight off the bat. Can I ask what the product was? Even just a general idea. And, how did you find the emails. I've found myself procrastinating a lot when it comes to trying to acquire users. It's a lot more fun to build features than it is to do cold outreach. Yes, you found the site :). 1) Understandable, let me reply to the other 3 points to see if pricing makes sense after that. 2) We’re not trying to replace Calendly. Calendly is great for link-based 1:1 scheduling, but many execs still operate primarily over email and actively avoid sending links. Persona is an email delegation layer that handles inbound scheduling end-to-end: proactive follow-ups, coordinating across long threads, and dynamically rescheduling when higher-priority contacts come in. That distinction should definitely be clearer on the landing page. 3) Fair point that you’re not the audience. We’re focused on founders and execs who spend a meaningful amount of time coordinating meetings over email. For them, the pain isn’t finding a time once, it’s the constant back-and-forth, follow-ups, and reshuffling priorities. Not everyone can afford a human EA, and link-based scheduling tools can’t handle that level of personalization (talking to an investor is very different than a friend). Research we’ve seen shows execs still spend 6+ hours per week on scheduling. 4) That’s a good point, and we’re thinking along similar lines. Since Persona operates directly over email, there’s a natural distribution loop there, similar to Calendly links, and we plan to lean into that more deliberately. Would you be bothered if you were on our 23/mo plan and still had a banner there? Also, do you think there should be a free tier beyond the 14 day trial? Thanks again for taking the time to respond. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I’ve been thinking about why dead code detection (and static analysis in general) feels so unreliable in Python compared to other languages. I understand that Python is generally dynamic in nature.<p>In theory it should be simple(again in theory): parse the AST, build a call graph, find symbols with zero references. In practice it breaks down quickly because of many things like:<p>1. dynamic dispatch (getattr, registries, plugin systems)<p>2. framework entrypoints (Flask/FastAPI routes, Django views, pytest fixtures)<p>3. decorators and implicit naming conventions<p>4. code invoked only via tests or runtime configuration<p>Most tools seem to pick one of two bad tradeoffs:<p>1. be conservative and miss lots of genuinely dead code<p>or<p>2. be aggressive and flag false positives that people stop trusting<p>What’s worked best for me so far is treating the code as sort of a confidence score, plus some layering in limited runtime info (e.g. what actually executed during tests) instead of relying on 100% static analysis.<p>Curious how others handle this in real codebases..<p>Do yall just accept false positives? or do yall ignore dead code detection entirely? have anyone seen approaches that actually scale? I am aware that sonarqube is very noisy.<p>I built a library with a vsce extension, mainly to explore these tradeoffs (link below if relevant), but I’m more interested in how others think about the problem. Also hope I'm in the right channel<p>Repo for context: https://github.com/duriantaco/skylos</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Unless I've misunderstood your question, the bulk of web dev discussion happens in technical posts on personal and business blogs, which are then aggregated right here. It's a big part of why I'm on here. If you're talking more about chat, the more messy \"pair programming\" side of web dev, I have always found this happens in actual dev teams who are working on the same product or for the same business. You do absolutely get chat like this at conventions - I have been to DjangoCon and PyCon back in the day and there were enormously useful discussions at those - but devs need to have something in common to talk about. As someone else has said here already, web dev is a far far broader topic than you might think - I have often found speaking to other devs I did not understand what it was they were doing.

I plan to use DeepSeek for AI chat, but use Gemini 3 Flash for agentic usage and editing because it’s more intelligent. Lately, I’ve seen how many core AI apps have shifted their pricing models from per-request pricing to a fixed usage limit, but I’m unsure whether that’s frowned upon, creates a less pleasant user experience, or maybe even gives the feeling that you’re not getting what you paid for. So I’d like to hear some opinions on what decision I should make.</p></div>",

You want to be able to accept and do work on requests that are likely to succeed within reasonable latency bounds, and drop the rest --- but being careful that an instant error may feed back into retry storms, sometimes it's better if such errors come after a delay, so that the client is stuck waiting (back pressure) reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hi all,<p>I've noticed that container images are getting bigger (particularly with AI related images). I was annoyed the pricing of my cloud provider so I quickly whipped something up.<p>It uses Cloudflare R2 + workers which is the lowest cost way to do this (AFAICT). However, due to how Cloudflare works, I had to change the push side to do it (pull side remains the same). I don't mind this personally (simplifies things a lot for typical use cases imo), but not sure what others would think. I am dog-fooding it right now and it is working fine but wondering if there is any interest in the community more broadly? As a SaaS, $5/month would cover 100GiB storage easily. Egress has a non-zero associated cost, but I think would be noise for most use cases. Alternately it could be something you run in your own CF account perhaps. It is extremely fast as well since it leverages Cloudflare's edge / CDN. So, faster, cheaper but a necessarily a little bit different to take advantage of things.<p>Anyway, if anyone has any thoughts / feedback on this approach, please let me know.</p></p></p></div>",

I think anyone who's used Discord for long enough has seen their favorite server inevitably add so many channels that the discussion gets spread out and diluted to the point that the server feels dead, even though it might have hundreds of members. At the same time, your most active users eventually form their own group DMs with other active users that they get along with, while posting less and less in the main server. Discord actively encourages this by making it so easy to form group DMs and splinter servers (a good thing from a user's perspective, but a community-killer from the server's perspective). And financially, it's probably more profitable for Discord to do it that way too. reply",

          "text": "Some of that is the nature of community building in general. Facebook communities split all the time, and/or move to DMs (whether FB Messenger or WhatsApp or something else) and back. In terms of dilution, that's something you can generally fight. There's a lot more tools in today's Discord to mitigate \"too many channels\". Threads and Forum Channels can help. There are moderation actions that you can take like \"we're going to move this channel read-only because it hasn't been active since X, consider new conversations in #more-general-channel or threads of it\". In my experience one of the biggest causes of dilution that's less obvious is your server's notification strategy. If a server @everyone or @here or @channel enough, I have a tendency to mute that server and read it less often, and I'm not alone on that. Good use of easy opt-in/opt-out roles for notifications is key moderation tool. In my opinion, a lot of the best servers entirely disable @everyone/@here/@channel, have dedicated notifications for alerts, and have a dedicated Announcements channel for any \"everyone notification\" (but without @everyone mentions) that can be followed or muted separately from the rest of @-mentions (more personal replies, for instance). Anyway, if you seem to be facing too much dilution, the other key is to ask people what they need, if they are happy with the current channel layout, and if they have suggestions on channels to merge/reduce/move to Threads or Forum Channels. reply",

      "title": "Ask HN: A proposal for interviewing \"AI-Augmented\" Engineers",
      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hi HN,<p>I’m currently rethinking our hiring process. Like many of you, I feel that traditional algorithmic tests (LeetCode style) are becoming less relevant now that LLMs can solve them instantly. Furthermore, prohibiting AI during interviews feels counter-productive; I want to hire engineers who know how to use these tools effectively to multiply their output.<p>I am designing a new evaluation framework based on real-world open-source work, and I would love the community’s feedback on whether this sounds fair, effective, or if I’m missing something critical.<p>The Core Philosophy: We shouldn't test if a candidate can write syntax better than an AI. We should test if they can guide, debug, and improve upon an AI's output to handle the \"last mile\" of complex engineering.<p>The Proposed Process:<p>1. Task Selection (Real World Context) Instead of synthetic puzzles, we select open issues or discussions from public GitHub repositories that share a tech stack with our product.<p><pre><code>    Scope: 2–4 hours.\n\n    Types: Implementing a feature based on a discussion, fixing a bug, or reviewing a PR (specifically one that was eventually rejected, to test \"taste\").\n\n    Ambiguity: Adjusted for seniority. Junior roles get clear specs; senior roles get vague problem statements requiring architectural decisions.\n</code></pre>\n2. Establishing the \"AI Baseline\" Before giving the task to a candidate, we run it through current SOTA models with minimal human intervention.<p><pre><code>    The Filter: If the AI solves it perfectly on the first try, we discard the task.\n\n    The Sweet Spot: We are looking for tasks where the AI gets 80% right but fails on edge cases, context integration, or complex logic. The problem setup should not be too easy or too hard.\n</code></pre>\n3. The Candidate Test Candidates are required to use their preferred AI coding tools. We ask them to submit not just the code, but their chat/prompt history.<p>How We Evaluate (The \"AI Delta\"):<p>We aren't just looking at the final code. We analyze the \"diff\" between the Candidate’s process and our \"AI Baseline\":<p><pre><code>    1. Exploration Strategy: How does the candidate \"load context\"? Do they blindly paste errors, or do they guide the AI to understand the repository structure first? We look for a clear understanding of the existing codebase.\n\n    2. Engineering Rigor (TDD): Does the candidate push the AI to generate a test plan or reproduction script before generating the fix? We value candidates who treat the AI as a junior partner that needs verification.\n\n    3. The \"Last 10%\" (Edge Cases): Since we picked tasks where AI fails slightly, we look at how the candidate handles those failure modes. Can they spot the boundary conditions and logic errors that the LLM glossed over?\n\n    4. Documentation Hygiene: We specifically check if the candidate instructs the AI to search existing documentation and—crucially—if they prompt the AI to update the docs to reflect the new changes.\n\n    5. Engineering Taste (The Rejected PR): For the code review task, we ask them to analyze a PR that was rejected in the real world (without telling them). We want to see if their reasoning for rejection aligns with our team's engineering culture (maintainability, complexity, clarity, etc.).\n</code></pre>\nMy Questions for HN:<p><pre><code>    Is analyzing the \"Chat History\" too invasive, or is it the best way to see their thought process in 2026?\n\n    For those of you hiring now, how do you distinguish between a \"prompt kiddie\" and a senior engineer who is just very good at prompting?\n\n    Does the 2-4 hour time commitment feel reasonable for a \"take-home\" if the tooling makes the actual coding faster?\n</code></pre>\nThanks for your insights!<p>(Full disclosure: In the spirit of this topic, this post was composed by AI based on my draft notes.)</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

I’m sure there is a project you look back on knowing what you know now and cringe.  Tell me about the project and what would you do differently?” There are a few other questions.  But I am usually also trying to measure soft skills and what level of scope and ambiguity they are comfortable with. The last thing I’ve ever needed when I am looking to hire is another “ticket taker”. Even before AI, why would  ever hire a junior dev? They are practically useless, do negative work and easy enough to poach someone with experience from another company for only slightly more money if you paying standard enterprise dev wages. reply",

Email: bepotts47@gmail.com Hello! I’m a software engineer with professional experience in backend and full-stack development. Most recently, I worked as a Software Engineer at SiriusXM Radio, where I contributed to large-scale production systems. I was affected by a recent layoff and am now actively seeking my next opportunity. My strongest languages are Python, Java, and JavaScript. I’ve worked across multiple environments, including over a year in a classified setting, and I currently hold an active security clearance. I’m seeking a full-time entry- to mid-level software engineering role, ideally focused on backend or full-stack development. I’m open to opportunities across industries and teams and am happy to discuss how my experience could be a fit for your needs. I completed three years of Computer Science and Mathematics coursework at Virginia Tech, including the core CS curriculum (Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems). I was unable to complete my degree due to financial constraints. At this time, I’m seeking salary-based positions (no equity-only roles). I’m open to conversations, referrals, or advice and would love to connect. Thank you for your time and consideration. reply",

Résumé/CV: Available Upon Request Email: <HN Username> @ proton.me Looking for security engineer roles. For the past 5 years I have been building security tooling that internal teams can make use of. I work closely with other teams to help improve the security posture of their apps. I help write documentation and host department wide presentations to educate others about web app security and steps they can take to make apps more secure. I took on the responsibility of managing our H1 Bug Bounty Program which previously was failing SLA targets by 10+ months and managed to bring it down to days. I have helped mentor interns and junior developer and also been active in conducting pair programming interviews for future candidates. What you get from me is a go-getter, self-motivated individual. I am always looking to improve not only myself but also my work. reply",

Knowing one's tools is an extremely underrated skill, having the confidence know one's way around a code base, to not accidentally refactor a mission critical function or stored procedure, to understand the role of linters, formatters, and language servers, it pays massive dividends in the long run.

My experience has been quite broad in that time but my recent focuses in my spare time have been Python/Flask, and C/C++ (for a homebrew project on an old console that I enjoy contributing to) but my initial experience was with Java; the first thing I wrote was a CraftBukkit plugin that ended up getting over a million downloads. I'd consider myself very good at quickly familiarising myself with unfamiliar frameworks/languages, so even if it's something I'm not experienced in, I would be more than willing to do a take-home, or something similar (which I enjoy, esp. if it's something new to me). Looking for and would be grateful for any opportunities, includingr  non-SWE, e.g. I.T., or even something non-technical if your company is hiring for other roles. I do not use LLMs for any work or projects of mine, or prose I've written (personal preference, not a moral viewpoint).

I'm used to working cross-functionally and cross-team, improving communication, coordinating work of several teams to build and operate the thing which the business needs. I prefer building the right thing without haste, but know how to prioritize shipping the most impactful changes sooner. I value autonomy and high impact. I built things from a nebulous idea to a final implementation and production launch. I evolved large existing systems, including frontend, backend, and databases. I view AI coding tools positively, as a replacement of some human labor, but not of human judgment. I'm glad to communicate with people, to mentor fellow engineers when appropriate, to coordinate work, but I'm not trying to become a full-time people manager.

I will also consider permanent fully remote positions, but only quite senior ones - Staff Engineer / Architect level. I've been fully remote since 2018 and I intend to keep it that way. reply",

I am looking for my break to get into the contemporary software development scene, after having previously developed software (primarily Windows utilities) on my own and having dabbled in various technologies. This break will most likely take the form of a tech support, documentation, or QA role for a software development team. An entry-level developer position would be even better, from a company that will have a bit of patience as I rapidly level up to their contemporary technology of choice. I like both the aesthetic, UI, and social challenges of frontend development as well as the complex, very technical puzzles involved in backend development. It is very easy for me to be fascinated by cool technologies, both old and new. Another appealing option for me would be to be involved with AI model training and evaluation. I've had several years experience working remotely with international teams, though in primarily non-technical roles. I look forward to making first contact with your world! reply",

I can help you with: - Building an MVP of your product to put in front of investors and early adopters. - Overhauling existing products by adding major new features, fixing performance bottlenecks, or paying off tech debt. - Helping your team get up to speed with emerging technologies (currently interested in helping with TypeScript, modern React, the Jujutsu VCS, and LLM-driven programming). - Modernizing legacy products and migrating them off legacy tech stacks. - Acting as a bridge between your design and engineering teams. I'm primarily a frontend developer comfortable with vanilla HTML/JS/CSS as well as more complex frameworks (mainly React, but I've worked with others). I enjoy being a heads-down technical contributor to codebases. However, working with early-stage companies has allowed me to dabble in UX design, hiring, mentoring, technical writing, technical workshops, and product design. I enjoy wearing a ton of hats, and prefer to work at orgs that allow me to use the full set of my abilities. I enjoy using LLMs, but I do so responsibly.

I'm a backend engineer (~8 YOE) with strong backend & DevOps experience and decent frontend skills. Looking for a backend or backend-leaning full-stack role. I worked at Automattic (US), the company behind WordPress; fully remote, async teams across the globe. I've been part of teams focused on speed and rapid iteration, and I've also worked on high-quality systems where long-term maintainability and reliability matter the most. I believe this mix of experience has helped me develop a good sense of where each fits best and has enabled me to adapt quickly based on context and requirements. I've built and maintained time-sensitive, high-throughput, distributed services (millions of ops daily) and owned features and small- to mid-sized projects end-to-end from design to deployment. I do my best working autonomously, and I like to think of myself as a generalist. Most of my career has been in large enterprises (7+ YOE), but I've also done a fair amount of freelance work (around 1 YOE) for clients. I have a couple of small open-source projects on GitHub. reply",

Until earlier this year, I worked at Uber as a Developer Advocate for Cadence — an open-source workflow orchestration engine powering 12B+ workflows/month. I partnered with dozens of teams to support adoption, scale distributed systems, and troubleshoot production issues. Cadence is a key component of Uber's Michelangelo ML platform, and I worked closely with AI/ML teams to integrate it into fault-tolerant pipelines. I also supported internal model training efforts, including fine-tuning LLMs to answer Cadence-related questions and building systems to classify and prioritize developer support. At DoorDash, I contributed to the migration from Django to Kotlin microservices on the Drive Merchant Services team, focusing on customer support endpoints. I also designed and implemented a modular refund rules engine for our largest partners, enabling flexible refund logic and supporting internal tooling. I’ve previously built NLP pipelines at Jobscan to match résumés to job descriptions and score resume strength, and earlier, trained models to predict ad performance based on copywriting—my first foray into ML back in 2016. After wrapping up at Uber, I'm now excited to return to a hands-on engineering role with a collaborative, technically strong team and a path toward engineering leadership (EM or CTO). I'm particularly interested in infrastructure, developer platforms, and applied ML systems in domains like healthcare, logistics, finance, or defense. Outside of work, I enjoy navigating Puget Sound on my sailboat, wrenching on my motorcycle, and getting curious about obscure systems and trivia. Let’s build something meaningful. reply",

Most recently, I owned a flagship wealth-management platform used by tier-1 banks across Europe and Asia. I worked at the intersection of product strategy, deep technical constraints, and regulatory reality (MiFID II, LSFin, data protection). Highlights include: - Leading multi-team, multi-module roadmaps in high-stakes enterprise environments - Overhauling a portfolio optimizer end-to-end (methodology + UX), contributing ~€2M ARR - Acting as product/technical counterpart for large banking clients and supporting RFPs I’m comfortable going from problem discovery with demanding stakeholders to concrete execution with engineers, and I’m particularly effective where products are complex, technical, or regulated.

          "text": "Small boutique consulting | Remote (US) (some est meetings) | part-time/flexible/1099 Hi! I work with a small group of developers doing custom software development and consulting for small/medium businesses. We are seeking a developery-data person with experience specifically with CloudSuite Distribution by Infor for one of our clients. It may be a bit of a shot in the dark, but if you have worked with this *specific* ERP system before, we'd be eager to talk to you. Reach out at \"ekib.eikooc@rofni\".reverse() Please include your experience in your email body/subject as we will have to quickly triage out most of the spam. PS. Each time I post here I get ~500 emails, almost all are low effort that don't meet anything I am looking for, sometimes for months in the future. I expect it to be even worse as LLMs gain traction. I've hired 4 people from past posts (check my history if you want!), but it can take some time dig through everyone so I apologize to legitimate interests. reply",

We negotiate the right to open source all our client code, maintain a handful of popular libraries, and our engineers contribute to Django core. We sponsor PyCon, DjangoCon, and Django Girls because we're invested in the ecosystem we build on. We're looking for software engineers who value software design, system architecture, and collaboration. You should be comfortable with about half of these areas and eager to learn the rest: web application security, relational database design (PostgreSQL, beyond \"SELECT *...\"), Django internals, React, and distributed systems. What you'll actually work on: complex state machines for financial workflows, multi-tenant architectures with row-level security, custom database functions when the ORM isn't enough, and React frontends that handle real-time data without being a mess of useEffect hooks. We're a small team where you'll own features end-to-end (database design to React components) and have opportunities to shape technical decisions. You'll get paid to write source code with a team that practices empathy and values work-life balance. If you've ever wished your job involved more elegant state machines and fewer marketing landing pages, let's talk: info@fusionbox.com. reply",

You have to detect, track, and intercept it physically. No Cloud. Just on-board compute using:  \n• YOLOv8 Nano on Qualcomm QRB5165  Flight controller + NPU SoC. Don't know Qualcomm yet? No problem! If you have pushed Nvidia Jetson or  Hailo-8  to their absolute limits, you have the mindset we need. \n• Autonomous guidance using Proportional Navigation, MPC, or PID/LQR control loops\nIf that sounds impossible, you're right.

We focus on hard technical problems (anti-bot, browser automation, fingerprinting, captcha solving). We are hiring a senior engineer to take ownership of our core platform: scraper orchestrator, billing & payments, customer dashboard, and parts of our AI-based captcha tooling. This is a hands-on role with real ownership: architectural decisions, setting standards, and gradually mentoring other engineers. The role is very full-stack (infra, backend, frontend). Stack includes TypeScript (most backend & web), Rust (new backend services, migration in progress), Go (Android scraper), PyTorch (captcha solvers), PostgreSQL, Redis, GitHub Actions, Ansible, Ubuntu Linux, bare-metal Hetzner servers. We are profitable, demand is growing fast, and engineering bandwidth is the main bottleneck. Team is small (3 engineers), fully remote, mostly async (we expect ~4h overlap with UTC+8).

I’m a systems builder (CS/infra founder; shut down my last startup) who spent the past two years going deep on foundational math that most engineers (and I guess many mathematicians) tend to ignore, largely at an nLab level, because standard abstractions stop composing. I’m working toward a small, private apply-focus lab to bridge native CS intuition (computation, scale, systems) with structural, information-theoretic mathematics. The focus is composability, learning, universality, and complexity, with the intent to build, not publish. The approach is unconventional, but intentional: staying close to real systems while reworking foundations when existing methods stop composing.

I need someone with sound judgement and taste that can plan and execute independently, but that also can communicate and coordinate complex changes well. Ingenuity and resourcefulness.

At CareIgnition, we are building the transparency layer for healthcare. We transform massive, messy datasets into financial clarity for employers and providers. We are looking for a pragmatic generalist. You’ll be working across the entire stack: from building customer-facing features in React and Django to architecting data pipelines that process petabytes of medical claims and rates.

          "text": "I designed and 3D-printed my own slide rule to help me play Balatro! Balatro is a roguelike survival game where you need to multiply \"chips\" and \"mult\" together to meet a requirement each round. You get three chances to draft enough resources to survive. I designed my own slide rule to help with the mental multiplication - most of the fun of the game comes from the mechanics being slightly obscured from the player. Since I designed this slide rule myself, I was able to make a couple unconventional design choices that fit my needs. For instance, mine has three octaves so it can represent numbers within the ones, thousands, or millions' range, for example; no need to track arbitrary powers of ten. Since it's a rotary rule, it wraps around. Eg. 353×24 shows on the device as 8.47, so you can think of it as 8.47 thousand, for example. Holding a physical object in my hands while playing helps more than I thought it would. Should I take a card that increases chips by 600 or increases mult by 1.3×? Do I need to take a card to clear the blind in the short term, or do I have enough resources to draft a slower card that will scale better over time? Even just looking at how densely packed the marks are on the \"Chips\" side vs the \"Mult\" side of the device gives a visceral physical sense of what my build needs to focus on. Pictures and .STL: https://www.printables.com/model/1026662-jimbos-rotary-slide... Github repository: https://github.com/gcr/balatro-slide-rule The actual plotting code used Marimo notebooks, which host a python in your browser via WASM. Take a look here: https://marimo.app/l/4i15d7 I entered it in Printables’ educational tools competition but the other entries were cooler. Maybe HN might like it. :-) reply",

To illustrate, suppose someone tries to multiply 123 and 987 with a calculator but incorrectly punches in 123 and 187. My hypothesis is they'll look at the result but won't suspect any problem. The equivalent operation on a slide rule requires fewer physical actions and hence, is less error prone. Do you think there's anything to this hypothesis?

So you develop a feel for how quantities scale with multiplication. With a slide rule you can only multiply the significant digits, not the magnitudes -- which you have to do in your head.   So you do exactly the same thing with the slide rule to multiply 123 and 987,  1.23 and 9.87,  and 1,230 and 9,870.  In all three cases, you get exactly the same answer: 121 or maybe just 120 (you only get 3 digits of precision at best).  You still have to multiply the powers of ten in your head, to get the answers 121,000, 12.1, and 12,100,000. I am just old enough to belong to the last generation of slide rule users.

          "text": "> nomograms Me too! Nomograms are cool. They're little charts that let you compute a function physically, e.g. by lining up a ruler. A nomogram isn't a picture of a function: it is the function. If you're clever, you can make a nomogram that encodes complicated nonlinear mappings or even complex-valued relationships on a 2D plane. Occasionally nomograms are just better too: because they're continuous and analog, they can naturally express things digital logic people can do only awkwardly, just like Rust people can only awkward approximate things natural in Verilog (e.g. truly parallel CAM search). Nomograms are basically the tabletop gaming of math. Like a good tabletop game, a good nomogram requires a special kind of cleverness. Sure, coding something like Factorio is also hard: but it runs on a CPU. Something as rich and complex as Power Grid and High Frontier? Running on cardboard? Whole other level. I recall one tabletop two-player game that featured a single-player mode in which you played against an \"AI\" that you ran by hand by moving cardboard pieces around on a game-provided template under pseudocode-ish rules from the game manual. It's hard enough to code a decent game AI with all the resources of a CPU at your disposal. It's an OOM harder to do it when you're limited to physically-realized lookup tables, a literal handful of registers, and a scant few clock cycles of logic per turn. Coming full circle, some of these tabletop game \"AI\"s incorporate nomograms to help them fit their logic within the constraints. Example of a cool nomogram: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_chart . Smith charts let you compute complex (pun intended) relationships in RF signal processing with just a compass and straightedge. Also: part of the fun in making nomograms is that there's no general procedure you can follow to make a good one, just like there's no general compiler from computer game to tabletop game. They're art: specifically, one of those forms of art that, like architecture, has to meet functional requirements while tickling our aesthetic sense. It's kind of funny how when you optimize this kind of art for aesthetics under their functional constraints, you end up supercharging the functional part by side effect somehow. reply",

Being able to setup a ratio is great though for unit conversions and things. It’s also really good for answering that question when driving where you’re like, ok if I go 10mph faster how much sooner will I get there which is otherwise hard to do mentally. Most of the benefit of using a slide rule in my experience comes not from using it, but from thinking LIKE you’re going to use a slide rule.

Some of it is pure nostalgia, though, I’ll admit. It a way to honor how people solved similar problems in the past. In the 18th century a sextant plus accurate chronometer or lunar distance table was one of the pivotal technologies of the age; you could use it to pinpoint your location on the boundless ocean within a few miles.

Heh heh, I was in the Sailing Cub in high school, and our Sailing Master (RIP Master Gibb) said literally the same thing about learning to navigate with sextant and chronometer even though we never sailed out of sight of land. It was all about deep respect for the history and tradition of being a Mariner. Now I fly gliders, \"the purest form of flight,\" and while you can get a glider with electrically operated landing gear, a jet sustainer engine, and digital navigation and flight computing devices... There is something extraordinarily pure about the exercise of flying with everything electrical turned off (except for the transponder and radio for safety). And even purer... Flying with covered instruments so we don't even get analogue airspeed and altitude. Circling back to slide rules... Sometimes we crave that simplicity, that direct experience of a thing. reply",

He taught me how to solve second degree equations (a x^2 + b x + c = 0) with just a slide rule.  The standard formula that I had learned in high school includes adding and subtracting, which a slide rule cannot do. His method involved pulling out the slider of the slide rule and inserting it backwards. Then, through some clever manipulation using the D and B scales (which now faced each other) and the A and C scales, he could actually solve the equation with just the slide rule. I wish I could remember exactly how it was done. reply",

Typically to do a calc I fire up Excel or the calc on my phone, bang in the numbers and accept the result without thinking. It's that \"without thinking\" part that is dangerous. The slide rule is slow and physical and forces my brain to think about the inputs. Another nice feature is that it can give you quick answers when you aren't sure of the accuracy of the inputs. eg if 2 * 4 was really 1.8*4.1, what would the answer be? It's quicker to see that on a slide rule (one tap on the ruler) than punch in 7 characters. reply",

I lost a few points from messing up order of magnitude calculations, but it was totally worth it. I've since collected a few more slide rules from estate sales in my neighborhood. I wish more people knew about them—they're such a neat and elegant part of engineering history, which is why I keep them around. I have no use for them on a day-to-day basis, though. An abacus is more useful for things like counting board game points and adding up taxes. reply",

Asked him about it and he joked that he didn't trust those transistors before explaining that it's just muscle memory to him and while a calculator would be faster he'd still earn the same per hour. Apparently I was the first to ask him in over a decade as everyone had moved on to do stuff in software and no one was pushing him to use a calculator anymore. Interns didn't inquire because they thought it must be some esoteric/religious practice. Last I heard he was still working there, management asked him to stay on past retirement age for his invaluable skillset. While its probably some other skill I just like to imagine the suits in a meeting where they decided to keep him on for this particular \"skill\" that no one else in the company had anymore. reply",

When I calculate something any other way, it involves thinking about what my thumbs automatically do on my 15C and translating that. When I'm away from it, there's a wonderful emulation of the 15C (and 16C) at https://jrpn.jovial.com . The numeric algorithms behave identically as far as I can tell, and it even includes the back panel (3-dot menu near the logo, then \"Help\"). The visuals make me feel right at home. If only they could reproduce the tactile experience. reply",

I still haven't found an Android app or website that can do everything that I need (basic functionality), but in general: - I need physical buttons. I often find that on touchscreens I mistype something and I don't notice. - The history feature. Maybe I want to do a serial task or calculation, and I can just replace/correct one of the formulas in the history and it automatically recalculates all of the expressions that came after it. - I have written some micropython code / utilities for the calculator and I use it all the time. - I don't want to context switch to do a quick calculation. On my PC I have to open up a new terminal or a website (I might be offline, so I have to hotspot and then connect the wifi and ...) and interrupt my existing work or I have to frequently switch between a PDF or latex or whatever that I'm working on. - Typing out `sin` or `np.sin` or `sin^-1` on PC is both longer and more error prone. It gets very frustrating very quickly. - The numerical solver is a godsend. Try solving for the roots of an expression like `xe^x = 10` on your PC without internet. Or with an android application. On my calculator it's just a few dedicated button presses. On the PC, I have to use isympy and typeout `nsolve(Eq(x * exp(x), 10), 1)`, and you wouldn't even get a proper graphical display of the expression while you are typing it. reply",

          "text": "Me too.  Love my DM42.  I also have an HP35s and two HP12Cs still on the batteries they were rocking over 10 years ago when I used them daily in my finance days. To answer the op's question, any RPN calculator is wildly better than the default calculators on things like iOS once you take the time to learn to use it[1].  If you want a good calculator app, Thomas Okken's free42 is a great, free HP42S emulator which runs on iOS.  I still prefer a physical calculator (eg the swissmicros has more screen space so you can see 4 lines of stack and dedicated function buttons) but it's much better than the default. [1] Great support for complex numbers in polar or rectangular form, fewer keypresses for multi-step operations, no ambiguity (whatsoever) about operator order without any need for parentheses, vast number of memory slots (not just one), the ability to write a program to do anything you can do manually on the calculator so you can automate anything you do frequently, numerical integration and root finding etc etc there are many many benefits. reply",

This in my opinion is better than using a stack calculator and RPN. There are also some small programs I wrote for like calculating parallel pairs for a given resistor value, based on E-Series since calculating resistors for stuff is quite a standard thing for your day as an hardware design engineer. - I also have a Casio fx-991ES Plus which I bought during my student years and love to use it, because it is way faster for quick stuff than my Prime and I changed its battery in the past 10 years just once. This is not the case for Prime where I have to charge it every week or two. But doesn't bother me. Prime is an amazing calculator. reply",

The tool that rather made me mostly abandon physical calculators (except if one is forced to use one, like for some kinds of exams) is rather Wolfram Mathematica. This program is so much more capable (a complete different league) than what every physical calculator that I am aware of has to offer that convenience and handiness of a physical calculator does not matter anymore for the comparison: Wolfram Mathematica is compared to a physical calculator like what a physical calculator is compared to doing all comparisons by hand. reply",

In about a decade I think I've done that once. The Casio is great. Looks like it's discontinued now? I guess the fx-9910CW is the replacement. They made the buttons circular. Weird. reply",

In the past it was a ti 84 and then ti 89 titanium. But in the last decade schools have also embraced Desmos, a simplified version is even accessible on their standardized tests now. For personal use, I have an android emulator that runs TI 89 titanium. It hits the sweet spot for me in terms of completely covering basic and advanced features I would need from a calculator. If I need something extremely basic, I use the one built into Google search. If I ever feel myself limited by the 89, it's always been because I am trying to do something that would be better served by Excel or Desmos. The best calculator is the one most easily available. I personally don't see value in keeping a separate device. On the other hand, I will go out of my way to make sure the keyboard I am using has a dedicated numpad.

It has no graphing capability and it's barely programmable, but that's ok, I keep an actual computer nearby for those sorts of things. The calculator keeps earning new batteries bc tinkering with analog circuits I frequently want to evaluate little things like AB/(A+B) or 1/2piF or (1+S)/(1-S), or need the log 10 or square root or the cosine of something. In those circumstances, the calculator's compact form factor is quite convenient, compared to needing two hands at the computer keyboard, or one handedly hunt-pecking said keyboard. As for the mouse, that has to be the slowest, most focus stealing option of them all. The calculator doesn't take much room, so it can be kept within arm's reach without getting in the way, quickly gives me the numbers I need, without demanding I become fully engaged with it. Also, those old HP buttons are just so nice to press, a refreshing break from the dead flat glass you get everywhere else these days. reply",

I was recently in the office of a small company, and I noticed that the bookkeeper had a calculator next to a pile of paper (receipts?) on her desk. She also had a computer in front of her with a spreadsheet on the screen. When I moved here forty-three years ago, it was common to see abacuses used in similar situations. There's still an abacus school [1] not far from where I live, but it's been a long time since I saw one in use. [1] https://maps.app.goo.gl/nvTg4hfSjTcba47c8 reply",

          "text": "Back in the (early 1960s?) Isaac Asimov wrote a book on how to do arithmetic calculations in your head.  He pointed out that someone who developed that skill could solve problems faster in their head than by reaching for a slide rule, and they wouldn't necessarily be limited to slide rule approximations.  Engineers, accountants, etc. would be more productive by being able to do calculations without having to reach for a slide rule or pencil and paper. [pause for 'slide rule' chuckle] The same applies to \"open calculator app and key the figures in,\" though. I'm not sure that \"user interface\" was a thing back when he wrote that, but that's what he was talking about. reply",

And doubled as a learning TV remote & TV-B-Gone. I also have a virtual HP48 on my phone, tablets, and computers. In middle school, I had an HP 32SII. I remember being able to hear** either the processor clock or data line(s) of each of the 32 and 48 because one or more components acted as inadvertent audio oscillators that would make noises during computation (and during idle on the 48 because it had to keep redrawing the clock). I've used R, MATLAB, pspice, and Mathematica in the past. I'm a fan of Xcas and Wolfram Alpha now. * I also have a collection of HP 48[GS]X cards, the printer, and the overhead projector adapter. In lieu of the overpriced official HP 48G to computer RS-232 interface cable, one can be easily made from a Sony CD-ROM audio cable. ** With my much younger ear pressed up to it. reply",

Just a DB with lots of code wrapping it. But even the worst backends are relatively simple beasts. Just lots of cronjobs and lots of procedural code. While the code is garbage, it can be understood eventually. The backend is mature... even the tech debt on the backend is a known quantity! But the frontend... damn the complexity and the over engineering are something unique. I think there is a fetish among frontend developers to make things as complicated as possible. Packages galore and SO MANY COMPONENTS. As soon as people start inventing their own design system, UI framework, and sub packages I think the frontend is doomed for that project. reply",

Sometimes the tech debt is that BE can't pass this data all at once yet. Fine. Let's fetch it. But then FE gets creative. We can reduce nesting. We can chain it. We can preload stuff before the data loads. Instead of polling, let's do observers. Actually these aren't thread safe. And you know what, nothing should be in the UI thread because they'll cause delays. And this code isn't clean, one function should do only one thing. Actually why are these screens even connected? We should use global variables and go to any screen from anywhere. Actually everything can be global. But global is an anti-pattern. So let's call it DI and single page application and have everything shared but everything must also be a singleton because shared immutability is bad too. reply",

The teams are told to move on to something new, the old thing never gets fully finished and dies a long slow death, because no one wants to officially say that it was a waste of time and should be shut down. Do this repeatedly and it really starts to add up. At times we are running 3-4 platforms for the same thing. Two are legacy with one or two critical things still running on them with no support. One is “production”, but no one is actually paying much attention to it. And one is in development or pilot… it’s all anyone can talk about, but it doesn’t actually work. While that in-house developed pilot is going on, we’ll also be told to do a POC with a tool from some outside vendors. AI won’t solve political and bureaucratic problems. If anything, it will make it worse, as turnover to new products is expected faster. To get rid of technical debt, an organization needs to focus.

          "text": "A lot of tech debt I've seen stems from people tacking things onto a loose foundation – adding API endpoints when there's no clear pattern, adding validation or defaults in different ways, organizing layers of code in various ways, multiple implementations of the same business need. This is compounded when people come and go. The software/tech industry, in my experience, does not encourage long tenure – layoffs, reorgs, and the general trend of people hopping between employers every 2-3 years. Startups also love the idea of building things fast and ugly, and 5 years later that leaves the company with a successful product (hopefully), a team that's grown fast (and turned over multiple times), and a shaky foundation. Engineering generally seems open to paying down tech debt, but there's an overwhelming amount of it sometimes, and someone needs to deeply understand the problem and lay out a clear plan for taking care of it, and that takes serious effort. reply",

One thing to note w/ this model is you'll need the OEM keyboard to install linux since there's only one usb port; which will be required by the install media. Once you've installed though you can use any bluetooth or usb keyboard you want. Another thing is any micro-usb charger should work but I wouldn't rely on just 1amp, go w/ a 3amp.

I've done research today, and most of the things I come across are dead and gone, or seem abandoned somehow. I'm aware of Instapaper. I haven't tried it (yet).<p>Here are some thoughts on what might fit my personal taste:\n- lightweight\n- very cheap\n- self-hosting might be nice, since I have a VPS currently\n- I'd like to easily dump an open tab into a backlog, and get reminded about it later: maybe I go to the app, maybe I get a daily email of suggestions. If I don't feel like reading the page, I can \"snooze\" it or otherwise put it back in the backlog (or drop it)<p>I think that's all I really want. I don't need notes or AI summaries or multiple apps for multiple devices, etc.<p>I might just build it, but curious if anyone has something they love.<p>Thanks!</p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "This is an inherent value trap that’s really not sustainable for VC backed startups. Which will inevitably burn to the ground as the revenue dwindles. Pocket, Omnivore, Upnext, your next favorite server based read-later app. One of the reason I believe is the market is saturated with undifferentiated apps that’s all free. While I think self-hosting is great, you probably want to solve mobile capturing and consumption, hosting a server, then paring a modern maintained mobile app that you can configure so it connects to your self-hosted server. Omnivore maybe your best shot? Although maybe vibe code may get you there sooner? If you are on Apple ecosystem though, there is another self-sustainable way that doesn’t require you to host anything on your VPS, that works with mobile, which is iCloud/Cloudkit based apps. There are at least a dozen options here. I made one of these: - no account, no server, no tracking - Liquid Glass Mac app that launch from menu bar. - Separate iOS app purposefully designed for mobile - Doesn’t use a browser extension, but monitors double copies from clipboard. - Shows all the cards in a waterfall grid, so you don’t have to click into these cards to see what the link is about. Every website you use, from TikTok to GoodReads, will show up as well designed cards. - Uses Apple Intelligence on device to auto-tag links. - free to capture without limit, has a one time purchase option (that removes the sub nudge) as well as affordable subscription option with PPP in 10 territories (purchase power parity pricing). I believe it’s the sweet spot in this category, and with the subscription revenue we have, it will never shutdown as long as Apple still offers iCloud, plus, you own the binary.

Today it’s only a landing page + short survey (no product yet) to test whether this pain is real.<p>The core idea (2–3 bullets):<p>- Many of us capture tons of useful info (notes/links/docs), but it rarely becomes shipped work.<p>- Instead of better “organization” (tags/folders), I’m exploring an “action engine” that:<p><pre><code>  1.detects what you’re actively targetting/working on (“active projects”)\n\n  2.surfaces relevant saved material at the right moment\n\n  3.proposes a concrete next action (ideally pushed into your existing task tool)\n</code></pre>\nMy own “second brain” became a graveyard of good intentions: the organizing tax was higher than the value I got back. I’m trying to validate whether the real bottleneck is execution, not capture.<p>Before writing code, I’m trying to pin down two things:<p>- Project context signals (repo/PRs? issues? tasks? calendar? a “project doc”?)<p>- How to close the loop: ingest knowledge → rank against active projects → emit a small set of next-actions into an existing todo tool → learn from outcomes (done/ignored/edited) and optionally write back the minimal state. The open question: what’s the cleanest feedback signal without creating noise or privacy risk? (explicit ratings vs completion events vs doc-based write-back)<p>What I’m asking from you:<p>1.Where does your “second brain” break down the most?<p>capture / organization / retrieval / execution\n(If you can, share a concrete recent example.)<p>2.What best represents “active project context” for you today?<p><pre><code>  task project (Todoist/Things/Reminders)\n\n  issues/boards (GitHub/Linear/Jira)\n\n  a doc/wiki page (Notion/Docs)\n\n  calendar\n\n  \"in my head\"\n</code></pre>\nWhich one would you actually allow a tool to read?<p>3.What’s your hard “no” for an AI that suggests actions from your notes/links? (pick 1–2)<p><pre><code>  privacy/data retention\n\n  noisy suggestions / interruption\n\n  hallucinations / wrong suggestions\n\n  workflow change / migration cost\n\n  pricing\n\n  others</code></pre></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Sometimes I collect information about a topic for a few weeks or months, and eventually turn it into a proper guide (making guides is my job). I also LOVE paper notebooks, because they become a beautiful timeline of sketches, to-do lists, thoughts and plans. When I finish a notebook, I scan it then throw it in a drawer.

One framing that helps me is: the archive isn’t “truth”, it’s “evidence of what I cared about”, and it’s only useful when it reduces friction for a real moment (re-entry, reflection, or a concrete next step). Otherwise it’s just noise. Do you find it more useful as a mirror (patterns about yourself), or as a tool (helping you make decisions / take action)? reply",

In other cases these notes are a complement to my photos. They show a different aspect of my life at a given moment. My photos don't show that on September 4, 2015, I had a massive crush on someone. I have built a timeline that combines my journals, photos, sketches, geolocation, Google searches and other things. It reveals a far more nuanced picture of me at a given time. I also have more technical notes. Those are a bit of a \"collection of facts\". It's a bit like putting all the parts on the table, and slowly organising them into a coherent structure. This is how I approach bigger topics before I understand them fully. Then my notes act as a sort of medium-term memory.

I like how you separate “write-only but still valuable” (emotional clarity / self-understanding) from “collection of facts” (laying pieces on the table until a structure emerges). The “notes aren’t an obligation” line also resonates — treating them as medium-term memory rather than a forever archive removes a lot of pressure. When you finish a project and you have leftover notes/todos you don’t intend to finish, do you actively prune/close them (mark done/obsolete), or do you just let them fade and trust that what matters will resurface naturally? reply",

          "text": "That makes total sense. Latency kills the workflow, and “advertised as AI” carries baggage even if the underlying technique is harmless. One nuance: the way I’m thinking about this isn’t “you type a query and wait for an LLM”. It’s more like local indexing/pre-computation so retrieval is instant, and any heavier processing happens ahead of time (or during a scheduled review) so it never blocks you. Then you can consume it as a pull-based view or a tiny daily digest—no interruptions, no spinning cursor. If you could pick one: would you prefer a deterministic synonyms/alias layer (instant, fully controllable), or a local semantic index that improves recall but still feels “tool-like” rather than “AI”? I’m exploring a similar local-first, low-noise approach (more context in my HN profile/bio if you’re curious). reply",

Kind of in the same realm as ms recall but more focused on security/privacy with sensible cryptographic defaults where needed. It is basically a server/data store and client agents, currently the agent is only for linux end user devices. The agent records evdev events (keystrokes/mouse movement), currently active window, clipboard history, shell commands issued and browsing behaviour. It runs as its own user and different functionality is compartmentalized into their own processes. Data is encrypted at rest. I'm still looking into how to best handle sensitive data in-memory at runtime. It stores these events in a persistent queue on the clients and one-way syncs it to the server. If a client is offline for a bit it syncs it when it comes back online. As such, I am also trying to minimize storage used. The idea is that rather than overwhelmingly linking stuff manually, e.g. with obsidian, locality of reference seems more useful as a baseline. In this data set, links by time are valued the most. In the future I'd like to add also the screenshot/video feature using hashes and perceptual hashes or an RDP like way to store as little data as possible. For now I'm mostly in the architecting phase but I do have an early working version. Really looking for suggestions architecture wise too. So far I came up with my own binary format to save events on the clients but I'm unsure if it's the right way to go. There are many challenges to be thought about, such as changing hardware configuration (display plugged in), protecting against statistical analysis (e.g. keystroke bursts), deletion of data across sources if required, how to make sure the system can run smoothly for a decade, etc. reply",

          "text": "While I do hoard notes I've realized over the years that the main reason I write notes is as a memory aid.  If I write it down I remember it better, and I'm more likely to do it.  Notes also act as a filter because I write stuff down, sometimes review the notes later, and decide what I wrote down isn't worth doing, so making a note of an idea essentially gives me a delay to review the idea and decide if it is worth doing.  I do also record links, keeping them in wiki pages (along with wiki pages for notes about various projects); I started doing that because browser histories today seem to autodelete old links.  Putting them into a wiki makes them searchable.  I keep journals as well, which are also searchable.  I don't necessarily want to be reminded of my notes and wiki/journal entries, I know they are there, I mainly want to call them up when I decide I need them.  That's the main drawback of paper notes, I can't search them.  I've tried scanning them, but it's tedious and they don't translate to ASCII text well, and drawings are not searchable.  I've considered using one of the e-paper notepads instead of paper notes, but I'd need a notepad handy in every room of the house and that would cost too much, and the procedures to automatically sync them to a central location don't seem very reliable (and I don't want to sync personal notes to some public cloud). So for me, an AI that suggests stuff would be annoying.  An AI that could take some vague search terms and my history and could pull old information out of notes that don't necessarily have the keywords I enter, using the context provided by my history might be useful.  So for example, I may remember I happened across a design for the DSP algorithms in guitar pedals, but the URL or note may not even mention DSP, so something that could turn a search for \"guitar pedal DSP\" into finding a link for an audio processing web page I visited would be useful.  The AI would probably have to scan all the web pages I visit to be able to store enough context to be useful for a search like that.  Doing this for 20 years or more might run into some scalability/cost issues. reply",

Context, long-term memory, and storage issues are indeed challenges currently facing AI and large language models (LLMs), and they're not unique to the scenarios we're discussing. However, with technological advancements, I believe these issues will eventually be resolved. Based on your requirements, it seems you need to grant the AI sufficiently broad access and privacy permissions. That said, leveraging what you've already stored, achieving the fuzzy retrieval functionality you mentioned should be feasible. It's impressive that you can recall exactly where to find your notes! That said, active retrieval still requires you to remember what you're looking for. I think your fuzzy retrieval concept shares some similarities with what I'm aiming for—where the AI offers suggestions based on your intended actions, even when you haven't consciously decided what to search for. Wouldn't you welcome that kind of assistance? reply",

The key is using it to solve problems you actually have, rather than problems you want to have. I was losing track of people's contact details --> I made an addressbook in obsidian. I wanted to track my exercise to find out how much I was running each week --> make graphs And so on.  Your obsidian should get a bit messy before you try to impose order on it.  Use it to solve a problem badly (Just writing down how far I run in a daily diary note) then improve (Writing a query to turn all of those notes into a graph). Personally I don't use any AI with my knowledge base. Good searching tools and a little bit of organization are the most useful thing for me. Personally, I think keeping lots of notes/links is a kind of digital hoarding.  Just like real hoarding, it's an emotional problem not an organizational problem.  If you can work out what emotional need hoarding links is fulfilling for you then you're on the way to working out how to get that emotional need fulfilled by something else. reply",

A tool could surface notes as *options* only when a thread is active, then write back only via diffs to `Next steps` / `Log` (human-approved), keeping it deterministic.

It’s also great for reference material (what was that long command SQL query I use). But yes it’s also a graveyard. - AirTable worked somewhat to keep moving projects forward, without growing unbounded. But only when there is a workflow. That looks like: dump tasks into rows, then create the steps as views of those tasks with different filters. So tasks essentially move systematically from uncategorized, no time estimate, no schedule, to getting tagged with all of that, and then I can narrow it down to see just what’s on the agenda for today’s date. I also have it show the sum of estimated time per date, because I inevitably end up scheduling 30 hours of tasks for a day, so that helps keep me honest on what’s achievable. I did the same thing in Workflowy with custom JavaScript but AirTable seemed more effective for this. Tasks also get linked to project buckets, and I basically then just try to keep every bucket moving forward (don’t let any active bucket get starved). - I could throw all of this into an LLM and have it tell me what I should be working on, remind me about what I’m forgetting, and so on. But I’m basically not interested, because I’d have to give it additional context that would be beyond what I’m interested or allowed to share. Like, I’ll ask a generic question for advice to an LLM but if an LLM is going to remind me to ”call Robert about Project Mayhem , then it needs to know about Robert and Project Mayhem. reply",

On the LLM point, I agree with your hesitation. For anything that touches real people/projects, the default needs to be privacy-first: either local-only, or scoped so the model never needs sensitive identifiers. One approach I’m exploring is separating “private entities” from “public knowledge”: let the system operate on generic project states and action types, and only you see the real names. Another is: no pushy assistant at all—just a pull-based daily view that helps you move buckets forward with the workflow you already trust. If you had to pick one improvement that doesn’t require sharing sensitive context, would you want: 1. better workflow scaffolding (turn uncategorized into scheduled + estimated + bucketed faster), or 2. a way to attach lightweight “done/decision logs” back to tasks so the graveyard stops growing?

The problem is that I almost never come back to what I have saved. A simple example is YouTube. I save videos to watch later because I am not in the right headspace at the time. Then I avoid them completely. I think part of the resistance is that I know watching them properly will demand attention and probably lead to follow-up work, and I am rarely in a mode where I want that interruption. I have thought about the whole “second brain” idea, but I worry it would just become a dumping ground. Nothing would really resurface when it actually matters. I would mostly be relying on myself to remember that I once made a note about something when I happen to be working on a related problem. Lately I have been thinking about the idea of a passive, radio style feed that summarises the information I have collected and plays it back to me, so I can at least consume each item once. You see those TV shows about people who hoard. They cannot throw things away because they might be important one day. This feels uncomfortably similar. Maybe the real problem is not how we store information. Maybe it is that we aren't filtering hard enough on what is actually worth keeping in the first place. reply",

Filtering: deciding what’s worth keeping so the backlog doesn’t become guilt The “radio-style passive feed” is interesting because it changes the contract: you’re not promising yourself you’ll do deep work, you’re just letting the system replay what you captured at a low cognitive cost. If it worked, it could also become a filter: only the stuff that still feels valuable on playback deserves a second pass.

          "text": "Yep, that matches my experience. Logseq’s block tree gives you “structure by default” (parent/child context), so you can get away with being a bit looser with explicit linking. In Obsidian, because the unit is the note (not the block), you often have to be more intentional about creating/maintaining the links and structure. Out of curiosity: do you find Logseq’s block hierarchy alone is enough for re-entry, or do you still rely heavily on consistent wikilink naming/tags to avoid the “I swear I linked this but used a different term” problem? Details in my HN profile/bio if you want the angle I’m exploring around minimizing organization overhead while improving re-entry. reply",

          "text": "Yes the block hierarchy is enough for re-entry. There is a natural 'pruning' process where I return to notes and realise I need to rework them to make surfacing the information I need easier. I often adjust titles and aliases (and often find I have two notes with similar names that need 'refactoring' to one - but Logseq makes this easy). If I don't find the note straight away I can usually remember adjacent terms to find it, and then when I do, I tag it with the first terms I searched on (as acceptance of the associations my brain had naturally made). I'll keep an eye on your project. What I do struggle with with Logseq is there isn't an easy means to just dump ideas to organise later, partly because the mobile app is so slow. It really needs two UIs that integrate with the same base format for two different modes of note collection. I disagree with others that taking or 'hoarding' notes is more work than its worth. The benefit of being able to dump info quickly and pick it up again and being able to find it easily is so valuable. Sure some notes get written and never see the light of day again, but then they never consume further time because I just don't work on them, but they are there if I need them. There's no way to know what info will definitely be useful in the future. reply",

As notes organized by the limited number of well defined rules, they became easy to search and navigate by AI. Claude Code easily finds requested notes, working as advanced search engine, and they became a starting point for \"deep research\"  : find relevant notes, follow links, detect gaps, search internet. Repeat until reach required confidence level. The most advanced workflow so far is combination of TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) + First Principles Framework. Former generates ideas and hypotheses, later validates them and converge on final answer. reply",

Out of curiosity, where does the loop close for you today? After “deep research” produces a conclusion, do you write back into a MOC / decision log / project note, or does it mostly live in chat + commits? I’m exploring a similar loop (context → retrieval → suggestion → human review → write-back) with the same constraint: keep it auditable and reversible (diff-friendly).

          "text": "As mentioned in my current Ask HN post, the product is indeed not yet finalized or launched. The envisioned product, Concerns, acts as a bridge, linking your current concerns and target tasks to your knowledge base/resource repository and action list (which could be to-do lists, calendars, etc.), forming an organic closed-loop system. Using target/active projects within Concerns as triggers, it retrieves relevant information from your resource repository. It proactively pushes solutions, plans, and suggestions for users to filter. Selected items then enter the user's action list. The goal is to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in a lightweight manner, without altering existing habits for using resource repositories or action lists. This idea stems from my own pain points, and I genuinely hope that while solving my own issues, it might also address broader needs. Regarding your response: It's interesting that AI tagging primarily aids by adding extra searchable keywords. However, I'd prefer broader content and semantic search/matching capabilities without relying solely on tags—though tagging remains a viable implementation approach.\nThanks for the mymind reference—I'll explore it.

I also like the idempotency/provenance angle (unique IDs/links, checkpointing) and the “commit processing” workflow — that’s a concrete example of turning ongoing work into structured, queryable knowledge without a ton of manual ceremony. Curious: in practice, what improved your quality the most — schema validation catching broken links/types, or constraining the entity set so the agent can’t invent structure? Also, do you find yourself actually using the query language day-to-day, or is it mostly agent-driven retrieval?

The “1–2 insights per day” idea is exactly the shape that feels sane to me: pull-based, low volume, and designed to create momentum rather than dump more content. I also like your examples because they’re not just summaries — they’re context + a suggested next step. If you were to try something like this, which would you want it optimized for: 1. novelty (interesting facts / “did you know”) 2. action (a small project/task you can do in 15–30 minutes) 3. relevance to what you’re doing this week Details in my HN profile/bio if you want the direction I’m validating. reply",

SIP URIs would let me kinda-sorta communicate with the broader ecosystem, but many phones and software seem to have dropped support for it; only a tiny % of those typically using the PSTN (that is, a \"normal phone\") would be able to call or receive calls to/from my addresses -- but it would be able to be directly and neatly integrated into the email server, which is a big plus.<p>I will probably still implement SIP URIs and VOIP support into the email server on principle, but I wonder if anyone has any alternatives to consider. Ideally, I would be able to communicate on the PSTN, but this seems like a lost cause.<p>Also curious about anyone using VOIP for work whether or not they allow or block SIP URIs from external networks. I maintained our VOIP server at work more than a decade ago, but it was a \"side-project\" due to working at an SMB where I wore many hats and couldn't specialize in anything; I wasn't even aware of SIP URIs at the time.</p></p></p></div>",

It’s mostly been a dead end. Low open rates, almost no replies.<p>At this point, I’m not looking for the usual advice you see in blog posts or on reddit. I’m specifically curious about unconventional or non-obvious things that actually worked for you early on, especially things that felt a bit scrappy, weird, or counterintuitive at the time.<p>If you’ve been through this phase, what genuinely worked and got you your first users?</p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Hi Preston, I took a look at this and here's my comments: - Wrong ICP, \"early stage founders\" is not a buyer. They don't have enough email spam problems. Later-stage founders who do already have an EA.\n\n  - You're assuming the pain. People generally don't have problem with email scheduling. And if someone were truly spending 6+ hours a week on it, they would have already delegated.\n\n  - The messaging framing hurts you. The moment Persona is compared to a human EA, you lose on judgment, context, and trust. What could work though, - Narrow to a pathological edge case. One role, one moment, one acute pain. Examples: solo VCs without EAs, boutique bankers mid-deal, lawyers coordinating multi-party calls under time pressure, founders actively fundraising without support. - Reframe away from scheduling. Don’t sell logistics or efficiency. Sell control. This is a way more powerful messaging instead.\n\n  - Stop outbound. Insert parasitically into their workflow. Live where the pain already exists. Gmail plugins, CRM edges, investor update workflows. Be an appendage, not a destination.\n\n  - Accept that this may not be a standalone company. It may only survive as a feature inside a larger assistant or email client. I know it's a bitter fruit but think about this and digest it.  This isn’t about tactics. The problem doesn’t hurt enough for the people you’re targeting, at the moment you’re targeting them. reply",

          "text": "I like this quote: > First time founders are obsessed with product. Second time founders are obsessed with distribution. I have personally grown an app from zero to 100k+ users, with no marketing budget. I don't have a magic formula, but i can say in hindsight that the first 5 users were harder to get than the next 999,995. Here was my secret: I begged. Finding 5 people to actually use my product was soooo freakin hard. Once I got to ~100, organic growth started to take over, but things like responding to emails, fixing bugs and looking into new features right away make early users personally like you and more likely to tell their friends. The hard part is finding the right people at the right time. I googled \"Persona email scheduling\" and found https://usepersona.app/ , so I'll assume that is you. I don't know much about your product, but i assume you are targeting people who need to schedule lots of meetings. I have a few notes: 1) Your pricing is crazy. $660/year is a lot for automated meeting scheduling. Your comp should be Calendly which is closer to $10/month. 2) What problem are you trying to solve? Calendly seems pretty close to the perfect solution for one-on-one meetings. This seems to be for scheduling larger groups. Make that clear at the top of the page. If you are directly competing with Calendly, then just make that clear. 3) I'm not the audience, but think about who really has this problem. For me, 90% of my group meetings are scheduled within my company and we use Google calendar to find times that work. I dont do this enough that I'd feel compelled to try out a new product. Sales people schedule lots of 1-on-1 calls, but not sure that group calls is a big issue. So think about who this is really for. In general, just about the only time i will try a new product is if it provokes my curiosity (not gonna happen for a meeting scheduling bot) or it is solving a problem I need solved right now. Some products are really great, but finding the right person at the right time is a huge challenge. This is why I brought up the quote at the beginning. The right product with no distribution is very hard to get off the ground. I'd say that your early goal should be to find power users if possible... if you try to spread too wide of a net, you will probably fail. Better to have a few people who love your app than a larger group of people who think it's nice. 4) Let's say you do get a few users. Well, you are an email scheduling tool, so distribution is actually built on. On your free or basic plans, you can have a banner at the bottom of outgoing emails that says \"This email was drafted by Persona, the tool for automated emails\". Now you have free marketing on every email that goes out. Same way that my calendly link is free marketing for calendly. If people want that banner removed, they can upgrade their plan. Again, take this advice for what it's worth, which is very little, since 1) I dont know your market well, and 2) what worked for me may not work for you. reply",

          "text": "Thanks for your thoughtful reply. I really like that quote -- hopefully I start another company and think about distribution straight off the bat. Can I ask what the product was? Even just a general idea. And, how did you find the emails. I've found myself procrastinating a lot when it comes to trying to acquire users. It's a lot more fun to build features than it is to do cold outreach. Yes, you found the site :). 1) Understandable, let me reply to the other 3 points to see if pricing makes sense after that. 2) We’re not trying to replace Calendly. Calendly is great for link-based 1:1 scheduling, but many execs still operate primarily over email and actively avoid sending links. Persona is an email delegation layer that handles inbound scheduling end-to-end: proactive follow-ups, coordinating across long threads, and dynamically rescheduling when higher-priority contacts come in. That distinction should definitely be clearer on the landing page. 3) Fair point that you’re not the audience. We’re focused on founders and execs who spend a meaningful amount of time coordinating meetings over email. For them, the pain isn’t finding a time once, it’s the constant back-and-forth, follow-ups, and reshuffling priorities. Not everyone can afford a human EA, and link-based scheduling tools can’t handle that level of personalization (talking to an investor is very different than a friend). Research we’ve seen shows execs still spend 6+ hours per week on scheduling. 4) That’s a good point, and we’re thinking along similar lines. Since Persona operates directly over email, there’s a natural distribution loop there, similar to Calendly links, and we plan to lean into that more deliberately. Would you be bothered if you were on our 23/mo plan and still had a banner there? Also, do you think there should be a free tier beyond the 14 day trial? Thanks again for taking the time to respond. reply",

          "text": "IMO the problem with Discord is it encourages forming cliques and community fragmentation. I think anyone who's used Discord for long enough has seen their favorite server inevitably add so many channels that the discussion gets spread out and diluted to the point that the server feels dead, even though it might have hundreds of members. At the same time, your most active users eventually form their own group DMs with other active users that they get along with, while posting less and less in the main server. Discord actively encourages this by making it so easy to form group DMs and splinter servers (a good thing from a user's perspective, but a community-killer from the server's perspective). And financially, it's probably more profitable for Discord to do it that way too. reply",

          "text": "Some of that is the nature of community building in general. Facebook communities split all the time, and/or move to DMs (whether FB Messenger or WhatsApp or something else) and back. In terms of dilution, that's something you can generally fight. There's a lot more tools in today's Discord to mitigate \"too many channels\". Threads and Forum Channels can help. There are moderation actions that you can take like \"we're going to move this channel read-only because it hasn't been active since X, consider new conversations in #more-general-channel or threads of it\". In my experience one of the biggest causes of dilution that's less obvious is your server's notification strategy. If a server @everyone or @here or @channel enough, I have a tendency to mute that server and read it less often, and I'm not alone on that. Good use of easy opt-in/opt-out roles for notifications is key moderation tool. In my opinion, a lot of the best servers entirely disable @everyone/@here/@channel, have dedicated notifications for alerts, and have a dedicated Announcements channel for any \"everyone notification\" (but without @everyone mentions) that can be followed or muted separately from the rest of @-mentions (more personal replies, for instance). Anyway, if you seem to be facing too much dilution, the other key is to ask people what they need, if they are happy with the current channel layout, and if they have suggestions on channels to merge/reduce/move to Threads or Forum Channels. reply",

Think Consumer Reports meets Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid’s snacks, or whatever you’re curious about. Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, and get full lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn’t reach its goal within 365 days, you’re automatically refunded. All results are published publicly. This project was inspired by Nat Friedman's PlasticList.org and we use the same ISO 17025-accredited methodology they did, testing three separate production lots per product (when possible) and detecting down to parts-per-billion. The entire protocol is open. I just published new results today! Turns out Muir Glen's caned Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes are incredibly low in plastic chemicals. Yay!

Every new project (cloud consulting + app dev), I feed in the contract, transcripts of my discovery sessions, my labeled architecture diagram, transcript of the design review discussion and  any other artifacts. First I have to create Epics and stories anyway for the PMO even if I am working on it by myself. Then I ask  ChatGPT what the phases should be, I tweak it , break it down, give it more details, etc Finally, I ask it to give me unrendered markdown with the details and a checklist and that’s the starting point of my repo. As I’m using Codex (I never seem to hit limits with my $20 a month plan) and Claude (better at troubleshooting), I tell them to update my document with what’s done, guidance I’ve given  it etc. I treat both of them like junior devs and keep my hands on the wheel and test and verify each phase. Yes I know I’m fortunate that all of my work is greenfield -> empty repo and empty AWS account that I ask the client for. reply",
