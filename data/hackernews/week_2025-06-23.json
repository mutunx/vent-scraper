          "text": "Try this: never read without a pencil in your hand. Make it a point to not only orally or mentally restate but also rewrite by hand everything you read (on-screen and in real life) in your own words, and to make multiple drafts of each restatement until it is as succinct, orderly, and logical as possible. This practice will probably help you: * recognize and stop reading low-value material; * read less on your phone; * deeply understand what you're reading; * identify errors in what you're reading; * identify errors in your own understanding; * improve your own writing (and possibly your handwriting!); * recall what you've read and what it says and means; and * build a record of your reading, reactions, and thinking. And, of course, I think it should improve your ability to focus. You can also make flashcards while you're at it (again, handwritten ones) and develop a spaced-repetition practice for the important information and skills. --- Later Edit --- You mention long-form text in particular. One of the most effective tactics to use while reading is to discern the writing's architecture/structure — at all levels, from the writing's genre, to its main components and their arrangement, to how each main part is composed, and so on. Doing so not only helps to understand and critique the author's ideas, but also becomes a fun game that keeps your attention directed. And also keep in mind that > 99% of all writing is not only not great but also probably not worth reading in the first place. It's ok to use boredom as a guide: your mind may be indicating through boredom and distraction that what you're reading isn't worth the time and effort and attention it takes to do so. But if you have decided that you must read something, or that you want to read it and understand it, then I've found that there's no substitute for the handwriting technique.

          "text": "Well, physicality is part of the point: it slows the writer down and provides more engagement with text (with the text being read; and the text representing the reader's ideas about the text being read; and the text representing the reader's ideas about text representing the reader's (prior) ideas about the text being read). Furthermore, handling, pushing around, and organizing actual paper on an actual desktop has (in my experience) effects on the mind that are both different in kind and superior in degree to those achieved by merely thinking, speaking, or typing about something. The availability and simplicity are part of the point too: pencils and paper are ubiquitous; and easily found and inexpensively purchased if not immediately available. Written jots and drafts of ideas, summaries, and reactions (of the kind we're talking about here) are easy and quick to make; they readily reveal their content; and they're easy and quick to view simultaneously, to rearrange, to stack, reorder, organize, store, and share. Compare voice recorders: the devices are not ubiquitous and are costly; they break and are costly to repair or replace; they have many dependencies (batteries/charging/charging plugs; switches prone to failure; firmware; drivers; USB plugs or adapters that can become missing, damaged, or obsolete themselves); etc. And compare the audio tapes or audio files: they don't really and fully reveal their content by glancing at them; they're hard to keep track of; and they're more difficult to change or reorganize. All that said, I think voice recorders have a place and I use a dictaphone myself on occasion — but primarily to spit out several ideas quickly when time is of the essence, I'm afraid I'll lose the thoughts, or I can't find the words to describe them in writing but somehow can blab about the gist of them to create a sort of bookmark for later processing. But then I have to remember to check to see if I have audio files of orally recorded thoughts to process and then either transfer the files to my computer for transcription and printing, or else listen to the audio files and write the thoughts down myself. <Inevitably: oops, I forgot I had these; oops, device isn't here or isn't charged when I need it; oops, Wi-Fi is on the fritz; oops, I want to reorder, reword, or cross out some of these thoughts but not others, and I can't remember or retain in working memory the whole of my spoken audio to restate it all from scratch; etc.> In a way, doing it by hand avoids the same type of virtualization problems I experience when budgeting and spending and tracking money: doing it physically instead of by computer keeps or makes it \"more real\" to my mind, and I seem to make better decisions and fewer errors. That benefit alone more than makes up for any time supposedly lost in doing it by hand: slow is smooth, and smooth is fast. -- Later Edit --- The slower pace of writing by hand is also a big help because it acts as a filter. I find it helps me to filter out low-value reading (because I easily perceive when analyzing, summarizing, and reacting to something in handwriting would not be a fun or beneficial use of my time). And I find that it helps me filter out my own thoughts (because writing out the less-important ones would similarly take too great a share of the time and energy I have to spend). reply",

          "text": "First of all, listen to your body and calm down. I've been to an otolaryngologist recently because of recurrent dizzy spells. The test results were all good, and the diagnosis was simple: I've been unconsciously flexing my muscles and clenching my teeth. The advice was to build consciousness to this and actively relax. I've then realized that with that flexed state a kind of mental flex follows. I got used to this kind of stressed-out context switching that put my brain in a racing thought state. Noticing when this happens and consciously stopping and then actively releasing the bodily pressure has been an important step in regaining control of my brain.\nI've realized that I kind of conditioned myself to this kind of dopamine seeking that persisted regardless of the medium I'd consume. I'm >30 and therefore skipped the TikTok phase, but even as I got rid of the Instagram habit (it helps that the algorithm is really poor at predicting content I'd want to watch) I would find myself doing the same kind of short bursts of short-term attention and immediate switch even with text-based media such as Reddit or Wikipedia. Try to capture your mental state when you are in this \"mindless consumption\" mode and learn to identify it. Develop a habit to notice when this happens and then stop and ask yourself what are you chasing, after all. Try to pause at the content you're currently reading and read it till the end once you calm down. It also helps to find books that keep your brain active while being engaging to you. I've had a lifelong passion for linguistics and I found myself digging into language philosophy, for example. This is the kind of literature that keeps me engaged, but forces me to slow down as well to think and properly process what I've read. Your mileage may vary; we are different people and definitely you have different interests than me. While I'm not a fantasy fan, I'd be a little wary of picking up fantasy books. My observations tell that the most successful ones read like action movies or first-person video games, and fast-paced action is something you want to steer away from for the purpose of this exercise. Pick up something that challenges you a bit, but is still comprehensible with the context you have right now. reply",

Essentially, if the agent gets even slightly off the path I want it on, I need to just do it myself. I give up on trying to prompt my out of a mistake it made. You get stuck thinking “one more prompt/round and it will fix the problem and everything will be perfect”, then you find yourself 4+ rounds in with the agent flip-flopping between 2 things it’s already tried. reply",

Curious how does your team make sure a Slack decision doesn’t die before it reaches Jira? Any workflow tricks that actually stick? P.S.

          "text": "Thanks for the links—Brooks and Zawinski are exactly the guard-rails we keep taped to the monitor. No Silver Bullet: We’re not chasing a “one tool to rule them all.” The essential complexity—humans aligning on what to do can’t be deleted; we’re only trying to strip away the accidental part (manual copy-pasting). Zawinski’s Law: Instead of cramming every feature into one bloated app, we’re limiting scope to a single object model: A message, a task, and a doc are the same object, just rendered in different views. Chat ≠ Task Manager ≠ Wiki, but they sit on the same data layer, so hand-offs happen automatically rather than by re-typing. Anything beyond that (CRM, billing, email) stays as integrations no temptation to rebuild an Outlook clone. So the direction is “context cohesion without feature creep.” If we can kill the copy-paste tax and still keep each tool honest to its purpose, we think that’s the sweet spot.

Think of it like version control: Git doesn’t write code for you, but it removes enough coordination pain that good engineers ship more often. We’re aiming for the same effect between conversation and execution—same motivation, less drag. From our side, the north-star is a radically simple answer: let a single chat thread end all that visible complexity. One place, one flow, nothing to copy or sync. That’s the product we’re building toward. Curious have you seen lightweight workflows that actually cut this friction without adding new layers? reply",

Melting the mud in an electric arc furnace using a plasma containing 10% hydrogen reduces it to liquid iron and liquid oxides, allowing the iron to be easily extracted. The plasma reduction technique takes 10 minutes and produces iron so pure, say the researchers, it can be processed directly into steel. And the no-longer-corrosive metal oxides solidify on cooling, so they can be transformed into glass-like material that could be used as a filling material in the construction industry. ... \"New stainless steel pulls green hydrogen directly out of seawater\" https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43991630 reply",

But mostly I find out interesting stuff from https://marginalrevolution.com/ (which usually have links to FT, Bloomberg, WP, WSJ, etc.) I was once a New Yorker subscriber, but I no longer have patience for long form writing. I also once had subscriptions to the Montreal Gazette and Globe and Mail, which were pretty good for local and domestic news respectively (but only if you're Canadian). I also once subscribed to the Walrus when Jonathan Kay was editor, but it was too boring (it's Canadian, I'm Canadian, but I don't relate to anything they write about -- but I think they've gotten more interesting since). The Economist -- I'm torn. A lot of the writing sounds smart, but many of the articles are written by young Oxbridge PPE grads who can turn a phrase but don't have a lot of real world experience. The Economist seems to be read by people who want to seem smart, who want to hold an elite-certified opinion, but don't seem to want to to do the work to actually go deep on topics and would rather outsource their opinion formation to the Economist. I also once had a subscription to Foreign Affairs. Excellent long-form articles that I no longer have any patience for. You do get the occasional long form article that is so relevant and engaging that you're forced to read it to the end, but these are few and far between. I've gone back to reading books. reply",

          "text": "I'm terrible at selling stuff, in fact I quite hate it. But this request is so unexpected that I feel I can at least give it a try. A. The design for the print editions ( https://jacobin.com/issue/speculation ). It's distinctive, carefully laid-out content with smartly used negative space, uses fresh and modern colour palettes, bold typography, moving away from the “Courier New typeface”. (For font nerds, Courier was designed in the mid-50s as a typewriter face for IBM [0] and has been adopted by many publishers because it was considered cool and was in the public domain.) For visuals, Reimecke Forbes' fresh style and creative direction is clearly a winner: the editorial illustrations are beautiful and artistic, as are the rich and playful infographics and data visualisations, many created via freelance art commissions. In fact, the magazine owes much of its success to the design of its print editions; as this article states, \"It’s the single most gorgeous and visually clever magazine currently being published in print\" [1]. It's argued that creating a beautiful object is essential to the magazine's business model, which centrally relies on a small base of premium subscribers [2] and because the majority of its content is available for free [3]. I quite like website as well. It's making full use of the space, the choice of colours is to my taste (bar the intense red in the footer navigation menu), and the content is smartly structured on the page for the various site sections, such as the author [4] and taxonomy pages [5]. B. The magazine's social and political analyses Whilst US readers are their main audience, they do look at global events and often address political and social issues and challenges on a country basis. Depending on where you're based, there's a good chance that you'll find something of (political) interest. One may not necessarily share the left perspectives for whatever reasons, but the quality of the writing is rather good and they don't mess around with their analyses: for the most part they are rigorous, historically grounded critiques of neoliberalism [6] and current events, little to no populist fluff or shallow takes, and employing clarity of language. They write a lot about democracy and its processes, wealth inequality, the power of mass protest, environmentalism, healthcare, collective action/unions, economics, politics, the BS of philanthropy [7], and building societies that work for all, not just for the rich. The magazine is considered to be the most relevant and important publication of the American political left today – \"timely, globally oriented, and topically eclectic\" [1]. Described by the Nieman Journalism Lab as a journal of \"democratic socialist thought\" [2], the magazine is involved with projects beyond publishing analytical essays, for example coordinating a nonfiction series via Verso Books. The shared commitment of the founder and the co-editors to advancing a critique of liberalism that is free of obscurantist academic theory or “cheap hooks” also matters [8]. People like Chomsky recommend it (\"a bright light in dark times\") [9] and professor Corey Robin says [1] in Vox Mag that \"it’s completely in-your-face in its style and tone; it has this name, Jacobin, that just seems designed to push people’s buttons.” The article goes on to say that \"Jacobin isn’t a traditional journalistic outfit, and purposely so. Seth Ackerman, one of the magazine’s earliest contributors, says he and Sunkara (the founder) wanted to explicitly avoid what the latter called 'rosy reports from the front'.\" Sunkara's approach is \"put your ideas out there, write as clearly as possible, and let it be challenged,\" which I quite like. The editorial standards are commendable, in my opinion: there's no clickbait, no \"both sides\" nonsense when holding power to account. One can certainly disagree with many of the things written in it, but it would be hard to deny that its content is intellectually stimulating and informative, often providing a fresh view over the political situation in the US, Europe, and Latin America, as well as plenty of historical context that helps the general public understand how we got here and perhaps offer some lessons from the past.

          "text": "D. Readership Jacobin is genuinely independent, as all quality mags should be – primarily funded by readers and subscriptions. They understand the demand for journalism and long-form content for a left (and beyond) audience, and constantly deliver on that. According to their site [10], the magazine has around 75k subscribers (and 3M online visitors), which I think I read in one of the sources quoteed below that it outperforms nearly all explicitly left-wing print publications (think Dissent, The Nation, and The Baffler), and whilst not exactly mass-market, they qualify for top-tier among political journals. It should be said that it's uncommon for explicitly left media to reach this scale without corporate ads or institutional backing. I argue that it punches above its weight in terms of digital reach, syndication, and influence in academia and activist circles, but I don't yet have the data to back this conclusion up (mainly because it would take time to obtain it and I'm lazy). It may be small in absolute terms, but that in terms of influence per capita it's likely rather significant. If you spend a bit of time digging through its content (assuming your interests are aligned with theirs), it becomes obvious why. It's also surprisingly well-connected with policymakers around the world [1], and count among their clients the New Left Review and university presses like Duke and Stanford. E. Popularity and whatnot A few major media platforms have mentioned them in their shows, articles, news, and bulletins. MSNBC [12], NYT [8], the conservative National Review [14], Politico [15], Tablet Magazine [16], New Left Review [17], The Guardian [18], The New Yorker [19], CJR [3], and more. In addition to their staff, it's likely that some or most important left thinkers alive who can write in English and are active have contributed to the magazine. Notable contributors include Nathan J. Robinson (of Current Affairs), Cory Doctorow, Hilary Wainwright (of Red Pepper mag), Sohrab Ahmari (of Compact Magazine), Slavoj Žižek, normative political theorist Bernard Harcourt, basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bernie Sanders, the former vice president of Bolivia, Álvaro García Linera, the French author and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, Annie Ernaux, the West Papuan independence leader, Benny Wenda, the co-founder of the independent publisher OR Books, Colin Robinson, the former president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, and a host of authors, journalists, researchers, sociologists, historians, political scientists, economists, philosophers, lecturers, union leaders, organisers, workers, and more. It is really a pleasure to read many of these, everything considered [20]. To me, and many like me who want to see a more equitable and fair world - one that we should exert more democratic political control over - Jacobin is a much-needed source of information and investigation that holds power to account and translates boring but important social, economic, and political research into plain English. A just and sustainable reality of our own making should not just include the views of the left; it should encourage it to participate meaningfully in politics and help temper the right-wing extremism [21] that has been taking over the US, Europe, and much of the world over the last 40 years. In the end, what we need is a society that addresses the needs of individuals, communities, and the environment - not just market outcomes or abstract freedoms, which are merely instruments or limited goals within a larger context. Whether the magazine will maintain its ethos remains to be seen; I'm prepared for disappointment, but I also recognise that it's just a medium at the end of the day. What matters to me is what's being said there, and I try not to become too attached to the magazine itself. To those quick to demonise or reflexively dismiss the left's approach to politics, philosophy, social issues, and everything else, I would say there are strong arguments not to do that, especially if you value democracy. Most scholars, policymakers, organisers, economists, and researchers on the left advocate solutions that expand wellbeing across lines of class, geography, and identity. That should not just be acceptable, it should be taken seriously, pondered, and investigated. Otherwise, I'm afraid we're running out of options as a society. If the peaceful, honest, solution-focused approach is rejected, what the masses are left with is violence.

I’ll probably let WashPo lapse; not sure it’s providing anything more than WSJ is at the moment for me. Others I’ve subscribed to: FT — it was good, slightly slower news than WSJ but faster than The Economist. Spectator — right wing trash but exceptionally well-written — if you want to know what the mean-spirited right are feeling on any issue, this will tell you. Foreign Policy — great analysis but honestly felt like news that was too slow. reply",

They know the plot threads, the characters, themes, the possible twists to watch for. This is similar to any TV series or cinematic universe. (e.g. Superheros, Tolkien-style fantasy etc) The themes change over time, but in a gradual, controlled manner. And (nearly) all perspectives point at the latest. Specialist news sources are sometimes high quality. For example: Quanta magazine, which articles we see frequently here. Ground news is an aggregator that tries to balance out the Left/Right bias of news outlets, but I think this misses the point. reply",

Plus, in the UK, the default conservative paper, The Telegraph, seems to be tabloidising and click-bait-ising itself at breakneck pace.

          "text": "What have people been doing? I work at a public HPC center and we cannot compete with industry so we cannot afford to hire anyone with experience nor can we afford to hire anyone with an amazing academic track record. So we hire juniors with 0 YOE and a sketchy CV and we give them 6 months where their main goal is to learn the craft. And it honestly works amazing well. I don't know why industry is so focused on hiring only seniors because there's lots of good talent out there that could be had for much cheaper. When we interview we don't try to assess how much technical knowledge the candidate has, but rather, of the things which they have gained experience in (and they are allowed to dictate this), how much can they confidently relay to us. From this we can estimate how much talent the candidate has. We get some interviewees with seemingly strong CVs e.g. particle physics PhD who does Kaggle in their free time, but then they are not able to explain in detail anything they have done. We also get some interviewees who have seemingly mediocre CVs e.g. bad grades, didn't publish their thesis and bare github, but they turn out amazing. I guess my point is, experience is not talent, and some good talent does not sell themselves well and for the rest you get inundated with mediocre talent who know how to sell themselves. reply",

Here is how we do it: * Our corporate recruiters are picky and yet hyper aggressive about finding/reaching people that seem qualified. It’s how they found me. I am not sure what their process is for finding people. * Next they send me the resumes that pass their filter to see if I am willing to interview them. I am generally willing to interview anyone. * The interview with me is a filter. I see if the candidate is qualified based upon experience alone. I do not bother with technical questions unless I am trying to see if they lied in their resume. So many people lie on their resume. Instead I mostly dive into their problem solving ability, their interpretation of technology, and general communication capabilities. You only need three things to be good at software: writing skills, an understanding of the platform/syntax, and people skills. * The next interview is more technical and determines if the candidate is hired. As a background I work for a defense contractor. People tend to skew much older, more experienced, and more mature. The work tends to be more predictable and polished compared to my prior software career writing JavaScript. People are expected to exercise initiative and figure things out instead hoping something like React, jquery, or AI will save their job. These sorts of pretenders are the people I try to filter out. I know I wouldn’t go back to that world where most people are under qualified and hyper insecure. I suspect that’s why people in this line of work tend to be older and why people tend to seek this work out when they could make more elsewhere. reply",

You need at least 3 weeks to go through this in a sane manner - You need to know about tons of topics (distributed systems, concurrency, microservices, k8s, ci/cd, databases, OS, networking). It’s common for engineers to know a little bit about everything, but when asked about something in particular in an interview, you cannot expect deep knowledge - good luck trying to convince them that it doesn’t matter if you don’t have professional experience in $language, that you are rather an agnostic software engineer with experience in different progr languages and frameworks - if you don’t craft your cv with proper buzzwords, you won’t get a chance to get interviewed. The ones who read your cv first are: machines (that are inflexible) and hr recruiters that know nothing about tech besides buzzwords - good luck making a single mistake in the tech interview. Since the company has 100s of other candidates, they are only looking for the best of the best Honestly, I don’t know whats wrong  with using ai to “prepare” for interviews.

          "text": "First to me, hiring from a job posting's crop of CVs is going at it the hard way: of course you get 100s of responses. If you have alternatives available: network, recruiter, user groups, trade show, anything really, then use that at least in addition to random CVs (which then are backup). Second, I would suggest rounding up a few colleagues who can spend 20 seconds per CV. If 100s of these CVs all look basically the same - roughly impossible to judge a fit - then all these have failed already. Hopefully you are left with more interesting looking CVs which appear to actually say something (beyond keyword slop). A resume has one job. It shouldn't take deep reading to set aside 90% of them. Which leads us to resume intake software. I understand why HR depts use resume intake software - they don't have the competence to read them. But normally the technical team does have the competence - and should be able to tell quickly keyword slop from not keyword slop. (AI will mess that up - but I don't think we are there yet.) Some of the common resume formats out there fail us all 100%. They are not useful anymore. I appreciate candidates who notice what the resume is there for. reply",

          "text": "Been there, done that and I don't have an answer. For around 4 years I was a de facto consultant on paper(LLC-equivalent + invoicing) but the truth is, it was just a remote role for a foreign company, nothing to do with building something for myself. In all fairness, I've started building stuff on my own countless times over the years. In fact that dates back to when I was in my early teenage years, meaning over two decades ago. At the time, there was some merit to it but I lacked the knowledge and experience. At this point, software and the functions that are expected from it are not a single-person task. Example: I cannot do UI to save my life. There are also tasks which are incredibly tedious and time consuming, which is a can I keep kicking down the road whenever I get to that part. Hypothetically you could try to look for a partner in crime, which I also have. In my experience, everyone simply loses interest sooner rather than later. You keep pushing hard for another month or two, hoping they'd get into it but ultimately it is I who get's fed up and never brings it up again. If only I could count the times me and one or two other people have started something in which we saw potential and then shove it in the back of a storage unit, only to see an identical product pop up 2 years later and explode. To give you an example: back in 2018 me and two other people started working on an video conferencing tool specifically designed for education with all sorts of wild things integrated into it, from math and literature, all the way to music classes and art. It scaled incredibly well, it was incredibly cheap to run but it was a prototype at this point. Then, just like all other instances I eventually got fed up when I ended up spending countless sleepless nights while having a full time job and did a flip table. And as you can imagine, 2 years later, COVID, everyone go home, classes go online. Which brings me to a second point - I'm never happy when something I'm working on is completely half-assed - many people are not shy to present a semi-working product and figure out the rest along the way. In fact I've been working in such companies for much of my life. But if I were to do it myself, I'd never be comfortable promoting something, knowing exactly how bad it really is. In a nutshell - not everyone is made for that and also you need to be at the right place and the right time with the right people. Some people call it luck, I see it just as a function of entropy. reply",

          "text": "Working for wages doesn't have to mean 9-5 in an office. Many programmers work remotely with flexible hours. Most places I've worked had flexible hours and in-office requirements even before COVID. Self-employment can mean selling time and expertise in the form of freelancing. Or it can mean building products you sell. It can lead to a combination of both -- building products and then selling time/expertise to customers. The biggest SAAS companies (think Oracle, Salesforce, etc.) make considerable revenue from services along with licensing their software. I freelanced for a long time, selling expertise sometimes (not always) measured in time spent. A lot of successful freelancers bill in terms of deliverables, or on regular retainers, rather than charging per hour like a salaried job. The main value derived from working for an employer, especially early in a career, comes from developing a professional network and accumulating business domain expertise. Building software to sell frequently fails because of poor understanding of the target business domain, which gets wrongly interpreted as a marketing problem. Businesses don't need software or code in the abstract -- they need and pay for solutions to business problems, something that adds value, decreases costs, improved efficiency, yields competitive advantage. reply",

I initially bought the pebble keyboard as I had bought two replacement keyboards for my old T450 and the spacebar did not work on either one, even though i got them from two different outlets. cost £50 for the two keyboards. The pebble keyboard sits nicely on top of the failed keyboard and works perfectly for my needs. I then bought the pebble mouse to complement the keyboard. What I found great about them is that they can be set up to work on three different devices, They both have three settings for three different devices, I use one for my gaming/pentesting rig, one for my media server and one for my old T450. no more clunky wired gaming keyboards or mice and no more tedious wireless keyboards or mice with batteries running out or simple failing after a year.

This can be a lot more efficient than looking in incomplete or badly organized manuals (MUI, react-router, ...) or filtering out the wrong answers on Stack Overflow that Stack Overflow doesn't filter out.

          "text": "God this comment reads exactly like someone asked gemini to make a classic hacker news comment reply to this post. Slightly useful insight, that perfectly transition into an ad for the commenter’s startup.\n Actually, I asked o3 for a response to the OP and here’s what it generated. “Using AI for code has reminded me of this sensation… switching in and out of “driving” feels more exhausting than being 100 % one or the other.”\nYou’re not imagining it. There’s a fair bit of cognitive-science literature on task-set inertia: every time you hand work off (human→AI or AI→human) you pay ~100–150 ms to reconstruct the mental model, plus an exponentially-longer “resumption lag” if the state is ambiguous.¹ Do that dozens of times per hour and you’ve effectively added a stealth meeting to your day.\nA few things that helped me when pairing with an LLM: • Chunk bigger. Treat the AI like a junior dev on 30-minute sprint tickets, not a rubber duck you ping every two lines. • Use “state headers.” I prepend a tiny recap in comments — // you own: parse(), I own: validate() — so I can scan and re-hydrate context instantly. • Declare no-AI zones. Sounds counter-intuitive, but reserving, say, test-writing for uninterrupted solo focus keeps me in flow longer overall.\n…have you tried anything successfully to address it?\nWe were annoyed enough to build something. At Recontext (YC S24) we sit between your editor and whatever LLM you’re using; every AI request is automatically tagged with the diff, dependency graph, and TODO items so when you jump back in, you get a one-glance briefing instead of spelunking through scrollback. Early users report ~40 % fewer context switches during a coding session. If anyone wants to kick the tires, we’re handing out private beta invites — email is in profile.\n⸻\n¹ See Monsell, “Task switching,” Trends in Cognitive Sciences 2003 — the “switch cost” math is sobering. reply",

You've given a name to the pain: 'task-set inertia' and the cost of the 'stealth meeting.' Painfully accurate. The advice here is gold, especially treating the AI like a 'junior dev' on a 30-min ticket vs. a 'rubber duck' you ping every two lines. That really crystallizes the right mental model. Very cool that you're tackling this head-on with Recontexter. Solving the 're-hydrating context' problem is such a critical challenge. I'll be following your work. reply",

However when native UIs were prevalent, there were standards built up over years of hard-earned experience: for a Windows app, you wanted to get your tab order right, and you knew the convention of getting the Cancel button mapped to the escape key etc etc. See also the Mac and the HIG, encouraging apps to look and work roughly the same. There were always outliers and ugly UIs, but it always felt like there was a uniformity that made it easier to get around in an unfamiliar app. Whereas now, electron apps look and work very differently (comparing slack to Spotify to VSCode and so on). That said, I think very few people care as much as I do about it, and cross-platform UIs save a ton of development work. reply",

So while I used to agree with you re: usability, these days I'm not so sure anymore. One idle thought I had: when computer interfaces were still new, using physical analogies like file cabinets was good practice for teaching new users. Maybe GUIs are now commonplace enough that people are able to speak the different \"languages\" without as much trouble. reply",

On a traditional native UI you’d always have a menu bar, you’d always have a File and Edit menu. These days you may have a hamburger menu but it also may just be a wrapper for a menu bar. It’s just all a bit……vague I suppose. Tbh it doesn’t matter really. As I implied in the previous comment, I can’t imagine many people bemoan the fact they can’t press Alt-f to get an illustrative menu drop-down, even if I do. reply",

Though Apple's lack of native 3rd party search engine support has been annoying, and it requires various hacks from Kagi to make it work. That's my only gripe, but that's on Apple. The hardest things for me have been email and maps. The switching cost for email, especially one I've had since the gmail beta, is astronomically high. I don't think I will ever be able to fully delete the account (though I did delete about 5 alt email accounts I had with Gmail). Maps has also been hard, as Google Maps is my go-to place for business information and reviews. I use Apple Maps for actual navigation, but their POI and business data is severely lacking, and the lean on Yelp doesn't cut it. Kagi maps is being developed, but has a long way to go, and to get to the point of Google Maps... I don't think they have keep enough pockets for that. And there is YouTube of course, which is Google owned. There is really no good alternative for that. reply",

Proton Pass is nice, but the ‘drive’ feature doesn’t have anything remotely close to what the Google Drive / Docs / Sheets / Slides ecosystem has. It also seems relatively new, so we’ll revisit it in a few months hopefully. We also tested out Microsoft teams, and no, just no. It’s just really convenient to onboard employees and the browser management with chrome is ultimately the deciding factor, as well as not having to worry about email deliverability. I feel like there is a somewhat big market for someone who wants to take on the Google workspace / MS teams products. For the most part, I feel like this wouldn’t be difficult to build besides the email deliverability part being most crucial.

To go to libraries, browse the stacks, take a few books to a table, and skim through them. Basically, to avoid middle grounds and go all the way back to how I used to read before the web took off. It is not fixing my attention overnight, but I am improving over time. It also helps to have a focus.

          "text": "Try this: never read without a pencil in your hand. Make it a point to not only orally or mentally restate but also rewrite by hand everything you read (on-screen and in real life) in your own words, and to make multiple drafts of each restatement until it is as succinct, orderly, and logical as possible. This practice will probably help you: * recognize and stop reading low-value material; * read less on your phone; * deeply understand what you're reading; * identify errors in what you're reading; * identify errors in your own understanding; * improve your own writing (and possibly your handwriting!); * recall what you've read and what it says and means; and * build a record of your reading, reactions, and thinking. And, of course, I think it should improve your ability to focus. You can also make flashcards while you're at it (again, handwritten ones) and develop a spaced-repetition practice for the important information and skills. --- Later Edit --- You mention long-form text in particular. One of the most effective tactics to use while reading is to discern the writing's architecture/structure — at all levels, from the writing's genre, to its main components and their arrangement, to how each main part is composed, and so on. Doing so not only helps to understand and critique the author's ideas, but also becomes a fun game that keeps your attention directed. And also keep in mind that > 99% of all writing is not only not great but also probably not worth reading in the first place. It's ok to use boredom as a guide: your mind may be indicating through boredom and distraction that what you're reading isn't worth the time and effort and attention it takes to do so. But if you have decided that you must read something, or that you want to read it and understand it, then I've found that there's no substitute for the handwriting technique.

          "text": "Well, physicality is part of the point: it slows the writer down and provides more engagement with text (with the text being read; and the text representing the reader's ideas about the text being read; and the text representing the reader's ideas about text representing the reader's (prior) ideas about the text being read). Furthermore, handling, pushing around, and organizing actual paper on an actual desktop has (in my experience) effects on the mind that are both different in kind and superior in degree to those achieved by merely thinking, speaking, or typing about something. The availability and simplicity are part of the point too: pencils and paper are ubiquitous; and easily found and inexpensively purchased if not immediately available. Written jots and drafts of ideas, summaries, and reactions (of the kind we're talking about here) are easy and quick to make; they readily reveal their content; and they're easy and quick to view simultaneously, to rearrange, to stack, reorder, organize, store, and share. Compare voice recorders: the devices are not ubiquitous and are costly; they break and are costly to repair or replace; they have many dependencies (batteries/charging/charging plugs; switches prone to failure; firmware; drivers; USB plugs or adapters that can become missing, damaged, or obsolete themselves); etc. And compare the audio tapes or audio files: they don't really and fully reveal their content by glancing at them; they're hard to keep track of; and they're more difficult to change or reorganize. All that said, I think voice recorders have a place and I use a dictaphone myself on occasion — but primarily to spit out several ideas quickly when time is of the essence, I'm afraid I'll lose the thoughts, or I can't find the words to describe them in writing but somehow can blab about the gist of them to create a sort of bookmark for later processing. But then I have to remember to check to see if I have audio files of orally recorded thoughts to process and then either transfer the files to my computer for transcription and printing, or else listen to the audio files and write the thoughts down myself. <Inevitably: oops, I forgot I had these; oops, device isn't here or isn't charged when I need it; oops, Wi-Fi is on the fritz; oops, I want to reorder, reword, or cross out some of these thoughts but not others, and I can't remember or retain in working memory the whole of my spoken audio to restate it all from scratch; etc.> In a way, doing it by hand avoids the same type of virtualization problems I experience when budgeting and spending and tracking money: doing it physically instead of by computer keeps or makes it \"more real\" to my mind, and I seem to make better decisions and fewer errors. That benefit alone more than makes up for any time supposedly lost in doing it by hand: slow is smooth, and smooth is fast. -- Later Edit --- The slower pace of writing by hand is also a big help because it acts as a filter. I find it helps me to filter out low-value reading (because I easily perceive when analyzing, summarizing, and reacting to something in handwriting would not be a fun or beneficial use of my time). And I find that it helps me filter out my own thoughts (because writing out the less-important ones would similarly take too great a share of the time and energy I have to spend). reply",

One very simple thing is to just scan your page really fast, jumping one word towards the beginning of the line -> one word towards the end, maybe skipping every other line. Try to vaguely notice these words, but really just move fast. Do that for like 20-30s. Then go back and read at normal speed, it generally feels much slower and you get more details. It's the analogous of coming out of the highway and having the feeling that you're now driving super slow. Note: I can't read fast, I'm not affiliated to speed reading philosophies, I know that speed reading is not just the trick above, but here and there I use it to (re)gain focus and for me it works. reply",

          "text": "First of all, listen to your body and calm down. I've been to an otolaryngologist recently because of recurrent dizzy spells. The test results were all good, and the diagnosis was simple: I've been unconsciously flexing my muscles and clenching my teeth. The advice was to build consciousness to this and actively relax. I've then realized that with that flexed state a kind of mental flex follows. I got used to this kind of stressed-out context switching that put my brain in a racing thought state. Noticing when this happens and consciously stopping and then actively releasing the bodily pressure has been an important step in regaining control of my brain.\nI've realized that I kind of conditioned myself to this kind of dopamine seeking that persisted regardless of the medium I'd consume. I'm >30 and therefore skipped the TikTok phase, but even as I got rid of the Instagram habit (it helps that the algorithm is really poor at predicting content I'd want to watch) I would find myself doing the same kind of short bursts of short-term attention and immediate switch even with text-based media such as Reddit or Wikipedia. Try to capture your mental state when you are in this \"mindless consumption\" mode and learn to identify it. Develop a habit to notice when this happens and then stop and ask yourself what are you chasing, after all. Try to pause at the content you're currently reading and read it till the end once you calm down. It also helps to find books that keep your brain active while being engaging to you. I've had a lifelong passion for linguistics and I found myself digging into language philosophy, for example. This is the kind of literature that keeps me engaged, but forces me to slow down as well to think and properly process what I've read. Your mileage may vary; we are different people and definitely you have different interests than me. While I'm not a fantasy fan, I'd be a little wary of picking up fantasy books. My observations tell that the most successful ones read like action movies or first-person video games, and fast-paced action is something you want to steer away from for the purpose of this exercise. Pick up something that challenges you a bit, but is still comprehensible with the context you have right now. reply",

          "text": "Wear a high-quality mask like a KF94 or N95 in public and filter your air. I have been struggling with similar issues. Although writing this alone was a struggle for me, I hope I can offer some helpful advice and information, and I tried my best so bear with me! Reading this will be a nice workout for your brain at the least. --- The pandemic never ended- it just changed shape. The virus keeps changing, and acute symptoms may fade. But for many, the infection never truly ends. A major new review from Yale (Moen, Baker, Iwasaki) offers a comprehensive picture into the neuroimmune pathophysiology of long COVID. Common neurological symptoms in Long COVID include new onset cognitive difficulties, dysautonomia, fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy. Neurological difficulties resulting from COVID infection include reductions in attention span and difficulty maintaining focus for extended periods of time. The brain gets sick from COVID, even when standard scans appear \"normal\". PET imaging has shown reduced glucose metabolism in the brainstem, limbic inflammation, microglia digesting synapses. This is well documented at this point, but here's the link to the Yale study in mention: ttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40536011/ SO MASK UP! COVID is an airborne infectious disease that causes systemic organ damage, including in the brain. -- According to Dr. Michael Hoerger, Director of Pandemic Mitigation Collaborative of Tulane University, latest data shows the current average number of COVID infections per person is at 3.77 as of last week (6/16/25). Pair that with the fact that damage from COVID infections are cumulative and each infection increases your chance of noticeable long-term effects, there's a good chance your issues may stem from COVID-related damage. That's why I recommend to mask indoors to protect your brain from further cognitive damage. You want to reduce the amount of times you get infected as much as possible. Masking is an easy step. If you need access to free masks, check here to get connected with a local group: https://maskbloc.org/ Again, wear a mask! Check if you can get into a long-covid clinic (difficult in many places, I realize) for a neurological evaluation. There are brain exercises and a combination of medication treatments that may be able to help. From another article on a study (I'm so sorry, I'll summarize & put link at bottom), apparently the brain exercise app called BrainHQ (brainhq.com) has shown statically significant cognitive function improvement in long COVID patients. \"The UAB study ... showed significant benefits in many secondary measures, including large to very large benefits on depressive, fatigue, and brain fog symptoms, as well as a significant benefit in brain processing speed, and a trend toward large benefits on anxiety symptoms. No significant change was noted in a measure of global cognition.\" Essentially, \"intensive, repetitive, and progressively challenging activities can drive beneficial changes to the brain.\" However, you do want to be careful with triggering fatigue and post-exertional malaise if you suffer from that, so pacing can be important. Sorry again for making so much reading for you, but I hope this helps. Mask up, eat well, and exercise your brain over time, find a specialist if you can, and things hopefully will get better. I've gotten a lot better with help. Feel free to reply if you have any questions! www.news-medical.net/news/20250505/Breakthrough-brain-training-shows-promise-for-Long-COVID-recovery.aspx reply",

Honestly, it's a bit of a jerk move to date people to practice dating someone better. When people say they're unattractive, often it's not because they're ugly. Ugly is a disadvantage, but not the biggest one. For both men and women, it's usually because they lack confidence. Or they're boring. Or sleazy. If you're getting into a first date and not a second, you're likely attractive enough on the 'resume', just messing up on the actual date. You might be saying something wrong. You might be delivering a good joke the wrong way. Sometimes it's just saying things in the wrong order. The longer they go without some form of success, the less confident they become. I thought the diagnosis was fairly clear; sorry for jumping straight to pitching a cure. This is a good example of saying things in the wrong order. reply",

That you think LLMs are the cure to loneliness misses what a \"cure\" even looks like here. OP clearly writes well enough to get first dates - the issue isn't conversational content but likely body language, energy, presence, the thousand micro-signals that happen below conscious awareness. You can't chatbot your way into better posture or more relaxed eye contact. This is classic LLM wrapper syndrome. Someone has a hammer (conversational AI) so every problem looks like a nail (conversation optimization). But the actual failure mode here probably happens in the first thirty seconds of meeting, before anyone's even said anything substantive. Op would probably benefit more from something social like improv classes (physical presence, spontaneity), dance lessons (body awareness, comfort with proximity), or honestly just hanging out in social spaces doing things they actually enjoy rather than performing \"date behaviors.\" The energy of someone genuinely engaged in something they love is magnetic in ways that no amount of conversation optimization can replicate. I just don't believe that \"practice talking to a computer\" will ever be a sufficient platform to teach people how to be genuinely charming, let alone charmingly genuine. reply",

Iterating on specs is tweaking individual variables. You’re still missing the broader interactions between them, and sometimes, the formula itself changes (discarding some variables and getting new ones). And as soon as you hit production, the function is recursive (code is part of the things to take into account) So, specs is more like an historical archive of decisions taken. I prefer to take a change request (ticket) transform it into a list of requirements, then apply that against the code rather than iterating through old specs in order to produce a new version of the code. So it becomes f(z, k) where z is the specs for the change and k the old code, instead of f(a, b, c, …, z) (without k) where a and the others are updated specs and z is the new one. ADDENDUM In other words, specs are like memos while the code is the company policy handbook. No one edits past memos, you just issue new one, and then edit the handbook. So I rather have code versions (git commits, …) that links to change requests, which link to discussion and analysis. Not dealing with a pile of documents. reply",

Reality: Decisions still leak out of channels, tasks lose owners, docs go stale. Unifying everything in one mega-app can create new clutter, unless the app itself preserves context automatically.\nThat’s the angle we’re exploring: keep roles clear, but let the hand-off happen inside the flow so people don’t have to think about it. Curious how does your team make sure a Slack decision doesn’t die before it reaches Jira? Any workflow tricks that actually stick? P.S. We’re prototyping a tool that tries this “context-in one flow” idea \n(still private beta).\nIf anyone’s curious—or has horror stories about chat→task hand-offs—happy to swap notes.

          "text": "Thanks for the links—Brooks and Zawinski are exactly the guard-rails we keep taped to the monitor. No Silver Bullet: We’re not chasing a “one tool to rule them all.” The essential complexity—humans aligning on what to do can’t be deleted; we’re only trying to strip away the accidental part (manual copy-pasting). Zawinski’s Law: Instead of cramming every feature into one bloated app, we’re limiting scope to a single object model: A message, a task, and a doc are the same object, just rendered in different views. Chat ≠ Task Manager ≠ Wiki, but they sit on the same data layer, so hand-offs happen automatically rather than by re-typing. Anything beyond that (CRM, billing, email) stays as integrations no temptation to rebuild an Outlook clone. So the direction is “context cohesion without feature creep.” If we can kill the copy-paste tax and still keep each tool honest to its purpose, we think that’s the sweet spot. Curious where you’ve seen this approach succeed or crash and burn in real teams. reply",

Think of it like version control: Git doesn’t write code for you, but it removes enough coordination pain that good engineers ship more often. We’re aiming for the same effect between conversation and execution—same motivation, less drag. From our side, the north-star is a radically simple answer: let a single chat thread end all that visible complexity. One place, one flow, nothing to copy or sync. That’s the product we’re building toward. Curious have you seen lightweight workflows that actually cut this friction without adding new layers? reply",

My analogy wasn't intended to be about the UI or its 'one thing well' philosophy, but about the category of friction it eliminated. Before Git, the coordination overhead for code was immense think manual patches and diffs. Git didn't write the code for anyone, but it automated away that specific, painful \"collaboration tax,\" freeing developers to focus on the actual programming. I see a parallel today, but the \"collaboration tax\" has moved. It's now the manual, repetitive work of translating team conversations into structured tasks. We believe that specific friction can also be automated away, freeing teams to focus on the actual execution. So, you've helped me refine the analogy: It's not about building a product like Git, but about tackling a problem in the same way Git did by automating a specific, painful type of coordination overhead. reply",

          "text": "That's an even more precise and insightful framing. You're absolutely right—the catalyst was licensing, and the technical problem of SCM was, in a sense, already \"solved.\" Thank you for sharpening the point further. You've actually given me the perfect \"Part 2\" of the analogy \"the relationship between Git and GitHub.\" Yeah, Git is the powerful, low-level engine. Technically brilliant, but with a notoriously steep learning curve. The real explosion in adoption came when GitHub wrapped it in a user-friendly product with a clear workflow (pull requests, issues, etc.). GitHub didn't reinvent SCM; it reinvented the collaboration workflow on top of it. That's exactly how we see the problem we're tackling. The \"protocols\" of modern work already exist: real time chat, task lists, documents. But they exist as separate, low-level primitives, like Git commands. The \"collaboration tax\" comes from users having to manually act as the interface between them. Our goal is to be the \"GitHub for general collaboration.\" To take those existing primitives and build a seamless, opinionated workflow on top where the connections are automated. The user shouldn't have to think about the \"protocol\"; they should just be able to work. So, your point is well taken and helps clarify our position. We're not trying to build the \"Git\" (the core primitive). We're trying to build the \"GitHub\" (the intuitive workflow layer that makes the primitives powerful for everyone). And that philosophy is baked right into our name. The reason we're called Markhub is because we're building a central \"Hub\" where every \"Mark\" a team makes a message, a decision, a task, a document can live together in a single, seamless flow. reply",

The Economist seems to be read by people who want to seem smart, who want to hold an elite-certified opinion, but don't seem to want to to do the work to actually go deep on topics and would rather outsource their opinion formation to the Economist. I also once had a subscription to Foreign Affairs. Excellent long-form articles that I no longer have any patience for. You do get the occasional long form article that is so relevant and engaging that you're forced to read it to the end, but these are few and far between. I've gone back to reading books. reply",

          "text": "I'm terrible at selling stuff, in fact I quite hate it. But this request is so unexpected that I feel I can at least give it a try. A. The design for the print editions ( https://jacobin.com/issue/speculation ). It's distinctive, carefully laid-out content with smartly used negative space, uses fresh and modern colour palettes, bold typography, moving away from the “Courier New typeface”. (For font nerds, Courier was designed in the mid-50s as a typewriter face for IBM [0] and has been adopted by many publishers because it was considered cool and was in the public domain.) For visuals, Reimecke Forbes' fresh style and creative direction is clearly a winner: the editorial illustrations are beautiful and artistic, as are the rich and playful infographics and data visualisations, many created via freelance art commissions. In fact, the magazine owes much of its success to the design of its print editions; as this article states, \"It’s the single most gorgeous and visually clever magazine currently being published in print\" [1]. It's argued that creating a beautiful object is essential to the magazine's business model, which centrally relies on a small base of premium subscribers [2] and because the majority of its content is available for free [3]. I quite like website as well. It's making full use of the space, the choice of colours is to my taste (bar the intense red in the footer navigation menu), and the content is smartly structured on the page for the various site sections, such as the author [4] and taxonomy pages [5]. B. The magazine's social and political analyses Whilst US readers are their main audience, they do look at global events and often address political and social issues and challenges on a country basis. Depending on where you're based, there's a good chance that you'll find something of (political) interest. One may not necessarily share the left perspectives for whatever reasons, but the quality of the writing is rather good and they don't mess around with their analyses: for the most part they are rigorous, historically grounded critiques of neoliberalism [6] and current events, little to no populist fluff or shallow takes, and employing clarity of language. They write a lot about democracy and its processes, wealth inequality, the power of mass protest, environmentalism, healthcare, collective action/unions, economics, politics, the BS of philanthropy [7], and building societies that work for all, not just for the rich. The magazine is considered to be the most relevant and important publication of the American political left today – \"timely, globally oriented, and topically eclectic\" [1]. Described by the Nieman Journalism Lab as a journal of \"democratic socialist thought\" [2], the magazine is involved with projects beyond publishing analytical essays, for example coordinating a nonfiction series via Verso Books. The shared commitment of the founder and the co-editors to advancing a critique of liberalism that is free of obscurantist academic theory or “cheap hooks” also matters [8]. People like Chomsky recommend it (\"a bright light in dark times\") [9] and professor Corey Robin says [1] in Vox Mag that \"it’s completely in-your-face in its style and tone; it has this name, Jacobin, that just seems designed to push people’s buttons.” The article goes on to say that \"Jacobin isn’t a traditional journalistic outfit, and purposely so. Seth Ackerman, one of the magazine’s earliest contributors, says he and Sunkara (the founder) wanted to explicitly avoid what the latter called 'rosy reports from the front'.\" Sunkara's approach is \"put your ideas out there, write as clearly as possible, and let it be challenged,\" which I quite like. The editorial standards are commendable, in my opinion: there's no clickbait, no \"both sides\" nonsense when holding power to account. One can certainly disagree with many of the things written in it, but it would be hard to deny that its content is intellectually stimulating and informative, often providing a fresh view over the political situation in the US, Europe, and Latin America, as well as plenty of historical context that helps the general public understand how we got here and perhaps offer some lessons from the past.

          "text": "D. Readership Jacobin is genuinely independent, as all quality mags should be – primarily funded by readers and subscriptions. They understand the demand for journalism and long-form content for a left (and beyond) audience, and constantly deliver on that. According to their site [10], the magazine has around 75k subscribers (and 3M online visitors), which I think I read in one of the sources quoteed below that it outperforms nearly all explicitly left-wing print publications (think Dissent, The Nation, and The Baffler), and whilst not exactly mass-market, they qualify for top-tier among political journals. It should be said that it's uncommon for explicitly left media to reach this scale without corporate ads or institutional backing. I argue that it punches above its weight in terms of digital reach, syndication, and influence in academia and activist circles, but I don't yet have the data to back this conclusion up (mainly because it would take time to obtain it and I'm lazy). It may be small in absolute terms, but that in terms of influence per capita it's likely rather significant. If you spend a bit of time digging through its content (assuming your interests are aligned with theirs), it becomes obvious why. It's also surprisingly well-connected with policymakers around the world [1], and count among their clients the New Left Review and university presses like Duke and Stanford. E. Popularity and whatnot A few major media platforms have mentioned them in their shows, articles, news, and bulletins. MSNBC [12], NYT [8], the conservative National Review [14], Politico [15], Tablet Magazine [16], New Left Review [17], The Guardian [18], The New Yorker [19], CJR [3], and more. In addition to their staff, it's likely that some or most important left thinkers alive who can write in English and are active have contributed to the magazine. Notable contributors include Nathan J. Robinson (of Current Affairs), Cory Doctorow, Hilary Wainwright (of Red Pepper mag), Sohrab Ahmari (of Compact Magazine), Slavoj Žižek, normative political theorist Bernard Harcourt, basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bernie Sanders, the former vice president of Bolivia, Álvaro García Linera, the French author and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, Annie Ernaux, the West Papuan independence leader, Benny Wenda, the co-founder of the independent publisher OR Books, Colin Robinson, the former president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, and a host of authors, journalists, researchers, sociologists, historians, political scientists, economists, philosophers, lecturers, union leaders, organisers, workers, and more. It is really a pleasure to read many of these, everything considered [20]. To me, and many like me who want to see a more equitable and fair world - one that we should exert more democratic political control over - Jacobin is a much-needed source of information and investigation that holds power to account and translates boring but important social, economic, and political research into plain English. A just and sustainable reality of our own making should not just include the views of the left; it should encourage it to participate meaningfully in politics and help temper the right-wing extremism [21] that has been taking over the US, Europe, and much of the world over the last 40 years. In the end, what we need is a society that addresses the needs of individuals, communities, and the environment - not just market outcomes or abstract freedoms, which are merely instruments or limited goals within a larger context. Whether the magazine will maintain its ethos remains to be seen; I'm prepared for disappointment, but I also recognise that it's just a medium at the end of the day. What matters to me is what's being said there, and I try not to become too attached to the magazine itself. To those quick to demonise or reflexively dismiss the left's approach to politics, philosophy, social issues, and everything else, I would say there are strong arguments not to do that, especially if you value democracy. Most scholars, policymakers, organisers, economists, and researchers on the left advocate solutions that expand wellbeing across lines of class, geography, and identity. That should not just be acceptable, it should be taken seriously, pondered, and investigated. Otherwise, I'm afraid we're running out of options as a society. If the peaceful, honest, solution-focused approach is rejected, what the masses are left with is violence.

I’ll probably let WashPo lapse; not sure it’s providing anything more than WSJ is at the moment for me. Others I’ve subscribed to: FT — it was good, slightly slower news than WSJ but faster than The Economist. Spectator — right wing trash but exceptionally well-written — if you want to know what the mean-spirited right are feeling on any issue, this will tell you.

Each focuses from a different perspective, at the same dramatis personae. It's set up this way so viewers can follow, and be entertained. They know the plot threads, the characters, themes, the possible twists to watch for. This is similar to any TV series or cinematic universe. (e.g. Superheros, Tolkien-style fantasy etc) The themes change over time, but in a gradual, controlled manner. And (nearly) all perspectives point at the latest. Specialist news sources are sometimes high quality. For example: Quanta magazine, which articles we see frequently here. Ground news is an aggregator that tries to balance out the Left/Right bias of news outlets, but I think this misses the point. reply",

Reading a paper that aligns with what you believe anyway doesn't challenge you and merely reinforces your biases. I might roll my eyes on some stuff in the Guardian but that's better than just feeding myself whatever I think already. Plus, in the UK, the default conservative paper, The Telegraph, seems to be tabloidising and click-bait-ising itself at breakneck pace. Whenever I see a link to it, it's all about how foreign immigrants steal our jobs, overwhelm public services and give us cancer, while Communist Labour is introducing gulags, where salt of the earth Brits are forced to put pronouns in email signatures. FT has a clear finance/econ bias but is a damn good newspaper apart from that. I find it staying far from directional biases but delivering insightful information. reply",

(I think how most metals will react with acids to make hydrogen [1] but Al reacts with bases to produce hydrogen too) The demand is high so there is a lot of research on ways to make hydrogen,  especially tuning up hydrolysis but also finding it underground [2] so call it high impact but high competition.

And, Is hydrogen plasma through and within the water worth it from a just hydrogen yield perspective?

Melting the mud in an electric arc furnace using a plasma containing 10% hydrogen reduces it to liquid iron and liquid oxides, allowing the iron to be easily extracted. The plasma reduction technique takes 10 minutes and produces iron so pure, say the researchers, it can be processed directly into steel. And the no-longer-corrosive metal oxides solidify on cooling, so they can be transformed into glass-like material that could be used as a filling material in the construction industry. ... \"New stainless steel pulls green hydrogen directly out of seawater\" https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43991630 reply",

          "text": "I've been working to move away from Google. Kagi was the easiest and best move. Though Apple's lack of native 3rd party search engine support has been annoying, and it requires various hacks from Kagi to make it work. That's my only gripe, but that's on Apple. The hardest things for me have been email and maps. The switching cost for email, especially one I've had since the gmail beta, is astronomically high. I don't think I will ever be able to fully delete the account (though I did delete about 5 alt email accounts I had with Gmail). Maps has also been hard, as Google Maps is my go-to place for business information and reviews. I use Apple Maps for actual navigation, but their POI and business data is severely lacking, and the lean on Yelp doesn't cut it. Kagi maps is being developed, but has a long way to go, and to get to the point of Google Maps... I don't think they have keep enough pockets for that. And there is YouTube of course, which is Google owned. There is really no good alternative for that. reply",

Proton Pass is nice, but the ‘drive’ feature doesn’t have anything remotely close to what the Google Drive / Docs / Sheets / Slides ecosystem has. It also seems relatively new, so we’ll revisit it in a few months hopefully. We also tested out Microsoft teams, and no, just no. It’s just really convenient to onboard employees and the browser management with chrome is ultimately the deciding factor, as well as not having to worry about email deliverability. I feel like there is a somewhat big market for someone who wants to take on the Google workspace / MS teams products. For the most part, I feel like this wouldn’t be difficult to build besides the email deliverability part being most crucial. Along with forking chromium or Firefox and reimplementing the browser management system, which also can maybe be done with an extension. reply",

          "text": "I understand the motivation behind this advice, but now that I'm past 50, I'd say that everyone needs to decide for themselves whether they are still pushing to maintain youth, or whether they are deliberately embracing aging. At some point, you stop exercising \"hard\", and start exercising \"enough\". The point is the same - to stay healthy. But you are not going to hit your lifetime peak fitness. Instead, you want to build a solid base of strength so that you still are fully capable and mobile into your 70s and 80s. As far as staying up on tech, again that depends on how long you really want to be in tech. Some people may want to remain technical for a couple more decades... but some of us are happy to let others take the lead, while we settle back into secondary positions, or pivot our ambition to leadership instead of hands-on work. What I'd recommend is some deep introspection to decide for yourself whether you are young or old, and act accordingly. \"old\" !== \"bad\". It is more a decision of whether you are still climbing, or simply enjoying the ride at a comfortable cruising altitude. I might not get hired by startups or FAANG for being in cruising mode, but once you get to this point, you aren't interested in such jobs anyway. The point is to figure out what is right for yourself, and don't push youth too far. There are natural changes to the pace of life as you age, and acceptance of that helps life satisfaction. reply",

          "text": "Yeah.  Perhaps \"as hard as you can safely handle,\" would have been better advice.  No ego lifting past 30. I'd add that if one is intellectually curious -- as I imagine somebody asking for advice here must be -- one's 40s are also a great time to take up a small noncommercial project.  Like attempt to solve a minor theorem, or a historical puzzle. (There are a lot of historical puzzles concerning nomenclature or the use of tools.  For e.g., to this day nobody knows what was meant when the medieval French wrote of the form of armor called \"double maille.\" ( haubert doublier, haubert a maille double, and haubert clavey de double maille ) But it's well attested in historical sources.  If you travel to enough museums, manuscript collections, and chapels -- to inspect knightly effigies -- there's a very good chance you'll be able to figure it out.  And, if you don't, I'd bet you still enjoy the ride.) reply",

As you write \"50% gone\" you've revealed a counting, quantitative mindset, so ask yourself if that's how you directly find life, or have you unconsciously adopted this way of thinking.

All of it comes to bodily death. Is that good or bad news? Since you've awoken to the idea of a conservation of yourself, and given that your question provides that you don't know what this means-- which indicates a normal orientation in midlife-- maybe you're ready to earnestly explore history? I assert that science knows little about life and never will. But it can reveal opportunities and hazards. It is in the arts and philosophy that the seeker may further prosper.

          "text": "The book \"Halftime\" by Bob Buford helped me 'orgnanize' my thoughts/wishes/dreams/aspirations for the second half. I had a fair idea of what/why/where/when/how I wanted things to be in the 'second half', and it helped me ask the right questions in a useful order. I believe Peterson's \"Future Authoring\" does something similar, but I haven't tried it yet (perhaps this summer I can make the time to try it out). If you are journaling, go back and skim through your journals (older first --> recent last) and see the changes (and trajectory/future/outlook). (Depending on the language you read it) Hector Malot writes on En Famille: don't read newspapers, they are a waste of time. I try to stay away from the news, and listen to (few) podcasts much-much later to see if what they were saying \"1 day after the XYZ event\" actually played out or not\". That gives a better measure/perspective of how much trust to put in those people/discussions. reply",

The next ten years… - well I got remarried at 36 - had a house built exactly three years after my last foreclosure (FHA minimum) at 42. - got my first only and hopefully last job in BigTech (working remotely - no longer there) at 46 - we did the digital nomad thing for a year between late 2022 and late 2023 - sold my house for twice what I paid for it last year and moved to a smaller condo in (cheaper state tax free Florida) - my wife and I still travel a lot and planning on spending 3-4 months next year away from home - 1 month in Costa Rica in the winter and the summer domestically. I never won the startup lottery, spent my entire career until I was 46 in 2020 as a journeymen enterprise developer, 3.5 years in BigTech wasn’t get rich money.  It was a pay off debt and pivot strategy. My life until I was 40 was messy with a few bright spots - met my now wife at 36 and (step)kids, made a lot of great friends while teaching fitness classes part time, etc. As far as “ageism”, I have found it easier to get a job post 40.  Including in 2023 and last year. reply",

The rich and powerful are not exempt from psychological distress and struggle. A house is a house, a family is a family, a car is a car, it doesnt matter how much they cost or how valuable they are. It is the value that we as individuals put on those things that are important to us, that makes the difference. Im nearly 70. I am in the final years of my life. These days I reflect back on a life well lived. that is all we can do. There is nothing special about life, we live and then we die. it is what we do while we are here that is important. 40 for me was the beginning of a new adventure.

What that means is highly subjective and personal. After being in the field for a little while you come to realize that languages are just dialects on the same core, new tech and frameworks are mostly just different wrapping, and that the core tenets and fundamentals that you know will always be there in some form. What will help you with longevity are things that are not traditionally looked at as SWE skills. Things like empathy for users and other developers, communication skills, being able to iteratively create user value, understanding costs of delays and that perfect is rarely what we want, etc, etc, etc.. Solving logic issues with algorithms is such a minute part of what we do, and the part most likely to be automated at some point. reply",

To go to libraries, browse the stacks, take a few books to a table, and skim through them. Basically, to avoid middle grounds and go all the way back to how I used to read before the web took off.

          "text": "Try this: never read without a pencil in your hand. Make it a point to not only orally or mentally restate but also rewrite by hand everything you read (on-screen and in real life) in your own words, and to make multiple drafts of each restatement until it is as succinct, orderly, and logical as possible. This practice will probably help you: * recognize and stop reading low-value material; * read less on your phone; * deeply understand what you're reading; * identify errors in what you're reading; * identify errors in your own understanding; * improve your own writing (and possibly your handwriting!); * recall what you've read and what it says and means; and * build a record of your reading, reactions, and thinking. And, of course, I think it should improve your ability to focus. You can also make flashcards while you're at it (again, handwritten ones) and develop a spaced-repetition practice for the important information and skills. --- Later Edit --- You mention long-form text in particular. One of the most effective tactics to use while reading is to discern the writing's architecture/structure — at all levels, from the writing's genre, to its main components and their arrangement, to how each main part is composed, and so on. Doing so not only helps to understand and critique the author's ideas, but also becomes a fun game that keeps your attention directed. And also keep in mind that > 99% of all writing is not only not great but also probably not worth reading in the first place. It's ok to use boredom as a guide: your mind may be indicating through boredom and distraction that what you're reading isn't worth the time and effort and attention it takes to do so. But if you have decided that you must read something, or that you want to read it and understand it, then I've found that there's no substitute for the handwriting technique.

          "text": "Well, physicality is part of the point: it slows the writer down and provides more engagement with text (with the text being read; and the text representing the reader's ideas about the text being read; and the text representing the reader's ideas about text representing the reader's (prior) ideas about the text being read). Furthermore, handling, pushing around, and organizing actual paper on an actual desktop has (in my experience) effects on the mind that are both different in kind and superior in degree to those achieved by merely thinking, speaking, or typing about something. The availability and simplicity are part of the point too: pencils and paper are ubiquitous; and easily found and inexpensively purchased if not immediately available. Written jots and drafts of ideas, summaries, and reactions (of the kind we're talking about here) are easy and quick to make; they readily reveal their content; and they're easy and quick to view simultaneously, to rearrange, to stack, reorder, organize, store, and share. Compare voice recorders: the devices are not ubiquitous and are costly; they break and are costly to repair or replace; they have many dependencies (batteries/charging/charging plugs; switches prone to failure; firmware; drivers; USB plugs or adapters that can become missing, damaged, or obsolete themselves); etc. And compare the audio tapes or audio files: they don't really and fully reveal their content by glancing at them; they're hard to keep track of; and they're more difficult to change or reorganize. All that said, I think voice recorders have a place and I use a dictaphone myself on occasion — but primarily to spit out several ideas quickly when time is of the essence, I'm afraid I'll lose the thoughts, or I can't find the words to describe them in writing but somehow can blab about the gist of them to create a sort of bookmark for later processing. But then I have to remember to check to see if I have audio files of orally recorded thoughts to process and then either transfer the files to my computer for transcription and printing, or else listen to the audio files and write the thoughts down myself. <Inevitably: oops, I forgot I had these; oops, device isn't here or isn't charged when I need it; oops, Wi-Fi is on the fritz; oops, I want to reorder, reword, or cross out some of these thoughts but not others, and I can't remember or retain in working memory the whole of my spoken audio to restate it all from scratch; etc.> In a way, doing it by hand avoids the same type of virtualization problems I experience when budgeting and spending and tracking money: doing it physically instead of by computer keeps or makes it \"more real\" to my mind, and I seem to make better decisions and fewer errors. That benefit alone more than makes up for any time supposedly lost in doing it by hand: slow is smooth, and smooth is fast. -- Later Edit --- The slower pace of writing by hand is also a big help because it acts as a filter. I find it helps me to filter out low-value reading (because I easily perceive when analyzing, summarizing, and reacting to something in handwriting would not be a fun or beneficial use of my time). And I find that it helps me filter out my own thoughts (because writing out the less-important ones would similarly take too great a share of the time and energy I have to spend). reply",

          "text": "First of all, listen to your body and calm down. I've been to an otolaryngologist recently because of recurrent dizzy spells. The test results were all good, and the diagnosis was simple: I've been unconsciously flexing my muscles and clenching my teeth. The advice was to build consciousness to this and actively relax. I've then realized that with that flexed state a kind of mental flex follows. I got used to this kind of stressed-out context switching that put my brain in a racing thought state. Noticing when this happens and consciously stopping and then actively releasing the bodily pressure has been an important step in regaining control of my brain.\nI've realized that I kind of conditioned myself to this kind of dopamine seeking that persisted regardless of the medium I'd consume. I'm >30 and therefore skipped the TikTok phase, but even as I got rid of the Instagram habit (it helps that the algorithm is really poor at predicting content I'd want to watch) I would find myself doing the same kind of short bursts of short-term attention and immediate switch even with text-based media such as Reddit or Wikipedia. Try to capture your mental state when you are in this \"mindless consumption\" mode and learn to identify it. Develop a habit to notice when this happens and then stop and ask yourself what are you chasing, after all. Try to pause at the content you're currently reading and read it till the end once you calm down. It also helps to find books that keep your brain active while being engaging to you. I've had a lifelong passion for linguistics and I found myself digging into language philosophy, for example. This is the kind of literature that keeps me engaged, but forces me to slow down as well to think and properly process what I've read. Your mileage may vary; we are different people and definitely you have different interests than me. While I'm not a fantasy fan, I'd be a little wary of picking up fantasy books. My observations tell that the most successful ones read like action movies or first-person video games, and fast-paced action is something you want to steer away from for the purpose of this exercise. Pick up something that challenges you a bit, but is still comprehensible with the context you have right now. reply",

One very simple thing is to just scan your page really fast, jumping one word towards the beginning of the line -> one word towards the end, maybe skipping every other line. Try to vaguely notice these words, but really just move fast. Do that for like 20-30s. Then go back and read at normal speed, it generally feels much slower and you get more details. It's the analogous of coming out of the highway and having the feeling that you're now driving super slow. Note: I can't read fast, I'm not affiliated to speed reading philosophies, I know that speed reading is not just the trick above, but here and there I use it to (re)gain focus and for me it works. reply",

          "text": "Wear a high-quality mask like a KF94 or N95 in public and filter your air. I have been struggling with similar issues. Although writing this alone was a struggle for me, I hope I can offer some helpful advice and information, and I tried my best so bear with me! Reading this will be a nice workout for your brain at the least. --- The pandemic never ended- it just changed shape. The virus keeps changing, and acute symptoms may fade. But for many, the infection never truly ends. A major new review from Yale (Moen, Baker, Iwasaki) offers a comprehensive picture into the neuroimmune pathophysiology of long COVID. Common neurological symptoms in Long COVID include new onset cognitive difficulties, dysautonomia, fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy. Neurological difficulties resulting from COVID infection include reductions in attention span and difficulty maintaining focus for extended periods of time. The brain gets sick from COVID, even when standard scans appear \"normal\". PET imaging has shown reduced glucose metabolism in the brainstem, limbic inflammation, microglia digesting synapses. This is well documented at this point, but here's the link to the Yale study in mention: ttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40536011/ SO MASK UP! COVID is an airborne infectious disease that causes systemic organ damage, including in the brain. -- According to Dr. Michael Hoerger, Director of Pandemic Mitigation Collaborative of Tulane University, latest data shows the current average number of COVID infections per person is at 3.77 as of last week (6/16/25). Pair that with the fact that damage from COVID infections are cumulative and each infection increases your chance of noticeable long-term effects, there's a good chance your issues may stem from COVID-related damage. That's why I recommend to mask indoors to protect your brain from further cognitive damage. You want to reduce the amount of times you get infected as much as possible. Masking is an easy step. If you need access to free masks, check here to get connected with a local group: https://maskbloc.org/ Again, wear a mask! Check if you can get into a long-covid clinic (difficult in many places, I realize) for a neurological evaluation. There are brain exercises and a combination of medication treatments that may be able to help. From another article on a study (I'm so sorry, I'll summarize & put link at bottom), apparently the brain exercise app called BrainHQ (brainhq.com) has shown statically significant cognitive function improvement in long COVID patients. \"The UAB study ... showed significant benefits in many secondary measures, including large to very large benefits on depressive, fatigue, and brain fog symptoms, as well as a significant benefit in brain processing speed, and a trend toward large benefits on anxiety symptoms. No significant change was noted in a measure of global cognition.\" Essentially, \"intensive, repetitive, and progressively challenging activities can drive beneficial changes to the brain.\" However, you do want to be careful with triggering fatigue and post-exertional malaise if you suffer from that, so pacing can be important. Sorry again for making so much reading for you, but I hope this helps. Mask up, eat well, and exercise your brain over time, find a specialist if you can, and things hopefully will get better. I've gotten a lot better with help. Feel free to reply if you have any questions! www.news-medical.net/news/20250505/Breakthrough-brain-training-shows-promise-for-Long-COVID-recovery.aspx reply",

          "text": "You’re definitely not alone “AI code loot box” is a great description! I’ve been experimenting with Claude Code (and the other major models) since late last year, and my success rate seems to track yours unless I’m deliberate about “prompt engineering” and workflow. Here are a few things that have helped me get better, more reliable results: 1. Be uncomfortably explicit in prompts:\nClaude Code in particular is very sensitive to ambiguity. When I write a prompt, I’ll often: Specify coding style, performance constraints, and even “avoid X library” if needed. Give sample input/output (even hand-written). Explicitly state: “Prefer simplicity and readability over cleverness.” 2. Break down problems more than feels necessary:\nIf I give Claude a 5-step plan and ask for code for the whole thing, it often stumbles. But if I ask for one function at a time, or have it generate stub functions first, then fill in each one, the output is much more solid. 3. Always get it to generate unit tests (and run them immediately):\nI now habitually ask:\n\"Write code that does X. Then, write at least 3 edge-case unit tests.\"\nEven if the code needs cleanup, the tests usually expose the gaps. 4. Plan mode can work, but human-tighten the plan first:\nI’ve found Claude’s “plan” sometimes overestimates its own reasoning ability. After it makes a plan, I’ll review and adjust before asking for code generation. Shorter, concrete steps help. 5. Use “summarize” and “explain” after code generation:\nIf I get a weird/hard-to-read output, I’ll paste it back and ask “Explain this block, step by step.” That helps catch misunderstandings early. Re: Parallelization and rate limits:\nI suspect most rate-limit hitters are power-users running multiple agents/tools at once, or scripting API calls. I’m in the same boat as you — the limiting factor is usually review/rework time, not the API. Last tip:\nI keep a running doc of prompts that work well and bad habits to avoid. When I start to see spurious/overly complex output, it’s nearly always because I gave unclear requirements or tried to do too much in one message. reply",

Work, work, work, work, 7 days a week. Many years after my first divorce I asked my ex-partner why we split. she told me that I was never there, you cannot have a relationship with someone who is not there. she told me she would have been happier if we had 50% of the money I earned, and to have spent quality time with me. The lessons in life are tough. reply",

          "text": "Spanish guitar is hard, there is not much crossover between spanish styles and modern pop/metal etc. It probably has more in common with classical music, but then the picking is completely different. It's not that Brian couldn't have done that solo, he's an amazing player and can play in multiple styles, it sounded like from the interview they just wanted to add a different perspective to the track. If you want to listen to something I think very few people in the pop scene could replicate I would suggest listening to Paco De Lucia. Of course people like Al Di Meola who played with Paco were able to crossover into that world but he is a virtuoso in his own right. reply",

It could be voice so you get used to voice; one issue I have is I can type well but the brain circuits don't trigger the same way when talking. Possibly start with an interested date at lower difficulty - someone who asks you the questions and coaches you into interesting answers.

Honestly, it's a bit of a jerk move to date people to practice dating someone better. When people say they're unattractive, often it's not because they're ugly. Ugly is a disadvantage, but not the biggest one. For both men and women, it's usually because they lack confidence. Or they're boring. Or sleazy. If you're getting into a first date and not a second, you're likely attractive enough on the 'resume', just messing up on the actual date. You might be saying something wrong. You might be delivering a good joke the wrong way. Sometimes it's just saying things in the wrong order. The longer they go without some form of success, the less confident they become.

That you think LLMs are the cure to loneliness misses what a \"cure\" even looks like here. OP clearly writes well enough to get first dates - the issue isn't conversational content but likely body language, energy, presence, the thousand micro-signals that happen below conscious awareness. You can't chatbot your way into better posture or more relaxed eye contact. This is classic LLM wrapper syndrome. Someone has a hammer (conversational AI) so every problem looks like a nail (conversation optimization). But the actual failure mode here probably happens in the first thirty seconds of meeting, before anyone's even said anything substantive. Op would probably benefit more from something social like improv classes (physical presence, spontaneity), dance lessons (body awareness, comfort with proximity), or honestly just hanging out in social spaces doing things they actually enjoy rather than performing \"date behaviors.\" The energy of someone genuinely engaged in something they love is magnetic in ways that no amount of conversation optimization can replicate. I just don't believe that \"practice talking to a computer\" will ever be a sufficient platform to teach people how to be genuinely charming, let alone charmingly genuine. reply",

External apps → Bubble/FlutterFlow. All avoid CRM lock-in.\" Why this works for HN:\nActionable: Clear criteria (internal vs. external use). Concise: No fluff; direct comparison.

          "text": "Yes, the company I work for has started using Hololens 2. We have a program that can overlay the 3D models from our CAD program onto the physical steel assemblies for QC. When it works, it works well and enables our quality checkers to perform checks faster and more accurately than using tape measures while going back and forth looking at a 2D drawing printed on 11 x 17 paper. The biggest hurdles is that none of the large companies think there is enough profit to be made from AR. The Hololens 2 is the only headset on the market both capable of running the program required while also being safe to use in a active shop enviroment (VR with passthrough is not suitable). Unfortunately the Hololens 2 is almost 6 years old as is being stretched to the absolute limits of its hardware capabilities. The technology is good but feels like it is only 90% of the way to where it needs to be. Even a simple revision with double the RAM and faster more power efficient processor would alleviate many of the issues we've experienced. Ultimately from what I've seen, AR is about making the human user better at their job and there are tons of industries where it could have many applications, but tech companies don't actually want to make things that could be directly useful to people that work with their hands, so instead we will just continue to toss more money at AI hoping to make ourselves obsolete. reply",

          "text": "The biggest issue comes from area mapping. In order to keep the hologram steady and anchored you need to perform a mapping process so that the helmet recognizes both the physical steel assembly and a bit of the surrounding area to keep it steady when moving around. The 8GB of RAM puts a limit on the amount of mapping data that can be stored putting a limit of the size of assembly you can work with, and since the mapping process relies on using the helmets own software that has not been work on in years it is extremely sensitive to any sort of background movement, which means it works best in as controlled of a environment as possible. Right now we are just using it for special projects that are complex and have little margin for error. We'd like to be able to use it for everything but that isn't feasible with where the tech is currently stuck at. reply",

A heads up display is just looking at the blueprint on a piece of paper with an additional layer of complexity, it wouldn't remove the need to manually measure, nor would it provide any assistance in spotting missing attached pieces (or some extra pieces). Once the model is overlayed QC goes from having to measure the placement of every pieces and the location of every hole to just walking around the finished assembly and ensuring that every conforms to the civil engineer approved model. A half hour process can be done faster and more precisely in 5 minutes, you notices very quickly when there is solid steel where the hologram has a hole, or thin air where the hologram shows that a plate was suppose to be welded on. reply",

          "text": "We work with all of the large general contractors in the steel construction industry. Right now, it's turned into one contract, but we are the second company the client has employed since the first company they hired failed to produce a single assembly that met their requirements. The client was the one that originally was using this tech since they wanted a way to do their own QC after the first experience, and we decided it was worth while pursuing ourselves since successfully pulling this project off while be a HUGE boost to our reputation. The construction industry is all about your portfolio of past projects. QA is the big sales point of the software we are using, but there are many other  potential applications for the same product. It should be possible to overlay the model on the main assembly prefab then use that to quickly mark where holes should be drilled and additional pieces attached. The other potential application that is being explored is using the holographic overlays to construct things out of the usual order, instead of building part 1 then starting part 2 since it needs to be built to conform to the first part you can instead build around the hologram so that your not relying on the previously built parts to ensure your angles are correct. I agree about the chicken/egg problem. Its an emerging technology where the payoff might be a decade away, customers need software that will actually benefit them, developers need reliable hardware capable of running software that has practical uses, and hardware companies want to know there is a customer base. The issue is AR falls under the category of product that the customer does not know they actually want, so the only way it is going to be developed is if one of the hardware manufactures takes a leap of faith and makes the long term investment. Sadly, I feel like AR is a million dollar idea with practical uses that has to contend with a business climate where you can make billions making some doodad that collects private data then displays ads to the masses. reply",

          "text": "For me the Vision Pro is my main machine now (supported by a MacBook Pro). And I absolutely love it. Which is saying something. My second most ergonomic situation is a 120\" screen with two 55\" screens tilting in from both sides (both in portrait, so all 3 screen verticals line up). All wall mounted. I started wall mounting to get screens off my desk, at which point it was clear bigger was always better. But for the Vision it took many rounds of trying third party head gear, and customization, before I could wear it comfortably for unlimited time. I just kept trying things until I got there. I am an obsessive optimist when it comes to ergonomics. Once the Vision is ergonomic for one's head, then it becomes a super ergonomic solution over all. The screen can be wherever you need it for best neck, back and body posture, whether at a desk, couch, (non-driving) car seat, or in bed. And a very wide screen beats any screen patchwork. Although I would like the Vision even more if I could have more than one Mac driven screen when I wanted to. (Recommend expansion batteries that clip on the original, and round magnetic USB-C cable adapters, for more spontaneous mobility.) I like the standard Apple straps in a pinch. But my face needs a serious break from the weight they distribute on it, every 30-120 minutes. reply",

It's not actually the weight. I have a Quest 3 with a BoboVR head strap, external battery, etc that all add up to be heavier than the AVP, but I can easily go for multi-hour social sessions with that on without any physical discomfort. You can put a ton of weight on your head with perfect comfort as long as it's balanced properly. The AVP's real problem is that its ergonomics are just shit. As with a bunch of other things, they designed for the ads instead of actual usability, so it's significantly worse than headsets that are actually much heavier, and the earband design with the way-too-far-back connectors and no top connections makes it nigh impossible for third parties to improve on it. The closest thing I've seen to making it comfortable is the third-party ResMed Kontor headstrap, and that's being produced in such low numbers that it's functionally impossible to actually buy. reply",

The ROI has to overcome the business (or personal) friction of buying the hardware, the friction of the form factor plus any friction from changed workflows. Now put that in an operational workflow instead of training and the risks go up. Most are still skeptical of device reliability (not to say there aren’t suitable devices for operational roles but the perception is still a hurdle, and the applicability is often device-specific). Now add on to that limited experience with devices (many decision makers have never put one on), added security complications, specialized software development skills, limited content libraries and very real accessibility concerns and a lot of enterprises can never get past an “innovation center demo.” For many industries the value proposition just isn’t there yet. But that said, I’d recommend digging a little deeper as there’s a lot of existing use-cases and deployments, both failed and successful, outside of IVAS. reply",

          "text": "Hello! I spent a lot of time in graduate school researching AR/VR technology (specifically regarding its utility as an accessibility tool) and learning about barriers to adoption. In my opinion, there are three major hurdles preventing widespread adoption of this modality: 1. *Weight*: To achieve powerful computation like that of the HoloLens, you need powerful processing. The simplest solution to this is to put the processing in the device, which adds weight to it. The HoloLens 2 weighs approximately 566g (or 1.24lb), which is a LOT of weight compared to a pair of traditional glasses, which weigh approximately 20-50g. Speaking as someone who developed with the HL2 for a few years, all-day wear with the device is uncomfortable and untenable. The weight of the device HAS to be comfortable for all-day use, otherwise it hinders adoption. 2. *Battery*: Ironically, making the device smaller to accommodate all-day wear means that you're simultaneously reducing its battery life, which reduces its utility as an all-day wearable: any onboard battery must be smaller, and thus store less energy. This is a problematic trade-off: you don't want the device to weigh too much that people can't wear it, but you also don't want the device to weigh too little that it ceases to have function. 3. *Social Acceptability*: This is where I have some expertise, as it was the subject of my research. Simply put, if a wearer feels as though they stand out by wearing an XR device, they're hesitant to wear it at all when interacting with others. This means that an XR device must not be ostentatious, as the Apple Vision Pro, HoloLens, MagicLeap, and Google Glass all were. In recent years, there have been a lot of strides in this space, but there's a long way to go. Firstly, there is increasingly an understanding that the futuristic devices we see in sci-fi cannot be achieved with onboard computation (yet). That said, local, bidirectional, wireless streaming between a lightweight XR device (glasses) and a device with stronger processing power (a la smartphone) provides a potential weigh of offloading computation from the device itself, and simply displaying results onboard. Secondly, Li+ battery tech continues to improve, and there are now [simple head-worn displays capable of rendering text and bitmaps]( https://www.vuzix.com/products/z100-smart-glasses ) with a battery life of an entire day. There is also active development work by the folks at [Mentra (YC W25)]( https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/mentra ) on highlighting these devices' utility, even with their limited processing power. Lastly, with the first two developments combined, social acceptability is improving dramatically! There are lots of new head-worn displays emerging with varying levels of ability. There was the recent [Android XR keynote]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nv1snJRCEI ), which shows some impressive spatial awareness, as well as the [Mentra Live]( https://mentra.glass/pages/live ) (an open-source Meta Raybans clone). In terms of limited displays with social acceptability, there are the [Vuzix Z100]( https://www.vuzix.com/products/z100-smart-glasses ), and [Even Realities G1]( https://www.evenrealities.com/g1 ), which can display basic information (that still has a lot of utility!). As an owner of the Vuzix Z100 and a former developer in the XR space, the progress is slow, but steady. The rapid improvements in machine learning (specifically in STT, TTS, and image understanding) indirectly improve the AR space as well. reply",

Though Apple's lack of native 3rd party search engine support has been annoying, and it requires various hacks from Kagi to make it work. That's my only gripe, but that's on Apple. The hardest things for me have been email and maps. The switching cost for email, especially one I've had since the gmail beta, is astronomically high. I don't think I will ever be able to fully delete the account (though I did delete about 5 alt email accounts I had with Gmail). Maps has also been hard, as Google Maps is my go-to place for business information and reviews. I use Apple Maps for actual navigation, but their POI and business data is severely lacking, and the lean on Yelp doesn't cut it. Kagi maps is being developed, but has a long way to go, and to get to the point of Google Maps... I don't think they have keep enough pockets for that. And there is YouTube of course, which is Google owned. There is really no good alternative for that. reply",

          "text": "I joked to a colleague that I’d pay google workspace another $10 a month just to remove the Gemini features. We are actively looking for a workspace alternative. We tested out proton’s ‘business suite’, and it just doesn’t come close. Proton Pass is nice, but the ‘drive’ feature doesn’t have anything remotely close to what the Google Drive / Docs / Sheets / Slides ecosystem has. It also seems relatively new, so we’ll revisit it in a few months hopefully. We also tested out Microsoft teams, and no, just no. It’s just really convenient to onboard employees and the browser management with chrome is ultimately the deciding factor, as well as not having to worry about email deliverability. I feel like there is a somewhat big market for someone who wants to take on the Google workspace / MS teams products. For the most part, I feel like this wouldn’t be difficult to build besides the email deliverability part being most crucial. Along with forking chromium or Firefox and reimplementing the browser management system, which also can maybe be done with an extension. reply",

          "text": "It's hard to say if you don't speak the language, but I think it translates to the wrong level of formality. Often too formal when asked to translate and too intimate when talking to a user in that language. They also get the tone all wrong. If you tell them what the tone should be like, they nail it. Often better than official human translations. Especially say, religious text. Some parts are meant to be heavy and grim, some are humor/sarcasm. But religious text often has that monotone thee/thou tone, especially in English. Which I feel is based out of a culture that places it distant, as something to be quoted instead of a proper story. I think it often misses out poetic bits. The order of language in German, like \"here comes me\" has a stronger and more poetic feel than the English \"here I come\". Haikus are supposed to bring a wabi-sabi feel of imperfection and impermanence, but in English they rarely carry over. Always prefer token pricing. None of the other forms of pricing really make sense to me; I guess they're just easiest for the VCs. reply",

Which then meant that these things had to be standout hits to be considered successful, which puts more pressure on perfecting everything, which takes more time, ... Then many studios have stories of either deep direction changes or large projects being cancelled as the money wasn't as available anymore and trends shifted. E.g.

          "text": "(edit: reading again, this is sort of besides the point of the parent comment, but whatever) I've been wondering about this as well, here are some of my hypotheses... Business related * Covid did it: we are currently experiencing a delayed effect. AAA games take roughly 5 years to develop (I think?), Covid generated a lot of uncertainty and chaos and thus less games got started during this period. Supply chains and finance were in disarray and we didn't know how long the pandemic would last. To make matters worse, this coincided with the release of the new console generation, which is typically a big moment of reorganizing and new ip, so we had a double whammy in that regard. How much new consoles would get sold in this new environment of chip shortages? How long would the shortages last? Is crypto here to stay and will they keep buying up al GPUs? * Lending has gotten more expensive and this is driving up risk perception and lowering profitability. In the aggregate this leads to less games being released. * There's been a lot of mergers between industry behemoths, so internal strategies and reorgs might have something to do with it. There is more vertical integration. There is less competition between AAA publishers because there are simply less of them. * Outsourcing has changed due to internal and geopolitics. Chinese game market development and government restrictions, etc. * There's been a switch to mobile and PC gaming, the home console market has been shrinking in relative terms. * Online game libraries on consoles keep expanding, resulting in lower demand for new games that we saw in previous generations. Game trends related * All AAA devs were making their variation on open world games, but there has been an increasing fatigue with the formula. I see something similar happening roughly once every decade where the AAA industry grapples to find new mechanics and a corresponding production pipeline. Like in the 2000-2010 period games became highly linear because that way you could slice the units of work in time. Then in 2010-2020 people got sick of that and the new production pipeline became one of open world freedom alongside editors and workflows that allowed the entire team to populate a single giant world. Gameplay changed from highly scripted cinematic experiences into 'immersive' gameplay systems. Player now are getting tired of this trend but we haven't figured out a new one yet. Before the 2000s this was less of an issue because dev teams were more nimble, asset creation was less of a bottleneck and technical innovations were a bigger driver in popularity and length of development. * There's been a switch to \"forever\" games in AAA. Where a studio just builds one big game they keep supporting and funneling players into. These are typically multiplayer, but that leads to issues of network effects. There's been a lot of new multiplayer games over the past decade but the player pool hasn't kept the same pace, so only the popular ones and first movers survive. * Indie games glut + higher quality indie 'AA' games causing the AAA sector to having to differentiate themselves more, which they suck at because they're all about return on investment. reply",

          "text": "Genuinely curious – what do you think the solution is? Personally I think labels like \"nationalist\" are unhelpful, but regardless what you label it what I do believe is that there needs to be a genuine conversation about whether it's better to have more expensive goods and services if it means people have jobs and opportunities. I'd be fine with iPhones costing 2-3x more if I knew they were built domestically. Those who couldn't afford them could always buy second hand or hold on to them for longer. And historically of course this was often how things worked... People brought quality clothes or quality furniture and looked after them for years – decades even. Whereas today because we can exploit foreigners for super cheap goods we don't really care if we need to buy a new pair of shoes every 6 months – it's created a completely different economic model and one that a skilled worker cannot compete with, at least on price. Perhaps the economy on the whole wouldn't grow as fast if there were more protectionist policies, but at the same time I'd be amazed if it didn't significantly improve job prospects and inequality. That said, we almost everyone in the middle-class deserves to lose their jobs to foreign workers for how awful they've treated those below them for struggling to find good work in the era of globalisation. reply",

          "text": "I understand the motivation behind this advice, but now that I'm past 50, I'd say that everyone needs to decide for themselves whether they are still pushing to maintain youth, or whether they are deliberately embracing aging. At some point, you stop exercising \"hard\", and start exercising \"enough\". The point is the same - to stay healthy. But you are not going to hit your lifetime peak fitness. Instead, you want to build a solid base of strength so that you still are fully capable and mobile into your 70s and 80s. As far as staying up on tech, again that depends on how long you really want to be in tech. Some people may want to remain technical for a couple more decades... but some of us are happy to let others take the lead, while we settle back into secondary positions, or pivot our ambition to leadership instead of hands-on work. What I'd recommend is some deep introspection to decide for yourself whether you are young or old, and act accordingly. \"old\" !== \"bad\". It is more a decision of whether you are still climbing, or simply enjoying the ride at a comfortable cruising altitude. I might not get hired by startups or FAANG for being in cruising mode, but once you get to this point, you aren't interested in such jobs anyway. The point is to figure out what is right for yourself, and don't push youth too far. There are natural changes to the pace of life as you age, and acceptance of that helps life satisfaction. reply",

Don’t try to get in as a software engineer.  Amazon, Google and Microsoft all have cloud Professional Services department where they value a combination of technical knowledge, leadership, and communication skills and you don’t have to do the leetCode grind.  They are all full time positions working directly for the companies with the same (but usually about 20% lower) compensation packages with cash + RSUs. They are positions like Solution Architects, Account Managers, Engagement Managers, Sales, and billable consultants. That’s how I got into AWS at 46 (no longer there) and until last year at least, Google/GCP was hiring former and current AWS ProServe employees like crazy.  I ignored their outreaches because at 51 I would rather get an anal probe with a cactus than ever work at BigTech or any large company again and definitely won’t be going back into an office. Don’t get me wrong, I have no issues with business travel (been there done that). While I am still officially an IC these days, I spend most of my time either leading implementations, doing discovery sessions as a post sales architect and some hands on work when necessary. reply",

I'd add that if one is intellectually curious -- as I imagine somebody asking for advice here must be -- one's 40s are also a great time to take up a small noncommercial project.  Like attempt to solve a minor theorem, or a historical puzzle. (There are a lot of historical puzzles concerning nomenclature or the use of tools.  For e.g., to this day nobody knows what was meant when the medieval French wrote of the form of armor called \"double maille.\" ( haubert doublier, haubert a maille double, and haubert clavey de double maille ) But it's well attested in historical sources.  If you travel to enough museums, manuscript collections, and chapels -- to inspect knightly effigies -- there's a very good chance you'll be able to figure it out.  And, if you don't, I'd bet you still enjoy the ride.) reply",

          "text": "Uh, yeah, so keeping in mind that \"haubert doublier\" was supposed to be more protective than the baseline stuff, it's either chainmail (1) with heavier and larger rings, (2) with two rivets per link, (3) with two layers, e.g. one hauberk worn on top of another, possibly with a linen interlayer (4) with smaller and many thousands more rings, (5) with double the links in each pattern unit – effectively, two rings where normally there would be one. There's some scholarly support for each interpretation.  The Romans were known to wear a double layer of mail, as their shoulder yoke overlapped their torso armor, though this predates the French and English by ~1000 years.  There's also a good example of #2 here, though it's quite recent and not European: https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/35633 The most popular interpretation, among scholars, is #5.  But there's no conclusive evidence.  IIRC there was an effigy of a knight at the cathedral in York wearing double mail, but it was removed (and now thought lost) in the early 19th century. This is the sort of ubiquitous historical question that can be solved by an amateur. reply",

Whether you're going from single to married, IC to manager, you have to fully embrace the role you take. Sometimes it feels like a step downwards - divorces, lost family members, career changes. Some have kids and can't do the things they once did. And in time, you'll pick up injuries and health problems. If you plan to fight and resist change, do so, but if you can't, then accept the new roles. reply",

The next ten years… - well I got remarried at 36 - had a house built exactly three years after my last foreclosure (FHA minimum) at 42. - got my first only and hopefully last job in BigTech (working remotely - no longer there) at 46 - we did the digital nomad thing for a year between late 2022 and late 2023 - sold my house for twice what I paid for it last year and moved to a smaller condo in (cheaper state tax free Florida) - my wife and I still travel a lot and planning on spending 3-4 months next year away from home - 1 month in Costa Rica in the winter and the summer domestically. I never won the startup lottery, spent my entire career until I was 46 in 2020 as a journeymen enterprise developer, 3.5 years in BigTech wasn’t get rich money.

          "text": "What scares you the most in life? A fear that absolutely paralyses you. Do whatever that is. For me for whatever reason, that extreme fear is heights and flying. I had an extreme fear of flying to the point where I would refuse to fly and instead take any combination of ship + bus to get to destinations. Had it my whole life. I would consider myself a very intense person. I’m a nihilist now, I don’t think there is any point to life at all. Truly it’s not been something I’ve ever been able to shake, so lately (last month) I’ve embraced it. I’m only 30. I’ve seen and experienced things in life that have completely broken me. 7 months ago i got diagnosed with adhd. 6 months ago I lost my job. 5 months ago almost to the day, my fiancé left me over a 10 minute phone call, after 7 years together. Took our dog with her. Blamed me for everything failing. Everything was my fault. Now our place is being sold. Lost all my friends over those 7 years and had no social media. I was in the darkest pit I have ever been in my life. Complete despair. I hit the gym as hard as possible, ate healthy, started twice weekly therapy, started going to events to meet people, started cycling, started rock climbing. None of that did anything to shake the intense depression and despair and underlying nihilism. Truly I had come to terms with the fact that I’ve had thoughts that you can’t “un-think” and I truly think most people don’t ever break down that no matter what you do life is pointless, low to the point that you think most people are living in ignorance of the pointlessness of living. So I tried pushing myself harder and harder. My life, I’ve been in several relationships that have failed. Been madly in love a few times. I’ve built viral software (300,000 users). I’ve sold software. I’m self taught. Backend/frontend/low level/graphics. I’m an Electrical Engineer too. I’ve pitched at and won startup comps, made and raised money. Owned a home. Worked with sick animals, walked dogs for a living. Been hiking, done woodwork. Been engaged. Failed papers. Aced papers. Been in a jail cell. Been in an ambulance. Have arthritis. Been in fights. Been beaten up. Taken drugs. Dissociated. Been skinny. Been fat. Been ripped. Almost drowned. Been in a car accident. None of that did anything for me. But last weekend I booked a solo flight for myself to a destination I’ve never been to. This is something that I’ve told myself I’m not capable of my whole life. Because I realised I probably wouldn’t be around much longer unless there was drastic change in my life and perspective. On the tarmac, the moment those plane engines started up I got super excited for the first time in years, because I realised either i die on this flight and it doesn’t matter anyway, or I push through fear and scare myself. I pushed through the fear and felt a rush. That was only a few days ago. Now I’m booking a global flight to see the other side of the world in 4 months time to do some solo travel. Then more flights after that. I also just did the best rock climbing I’ve ever done, prior to that experience I’d be clinging onto the wall for dear life, but that last session I just flew up the wall without a care in the world. I’ve realised now that I’m just an intense person and I can’t live a mundane life. So I need to lean into it and seek fear. I can tell you for free that material possession and earning money is definitely not the answer. In fact, get rid of most of the shit you own because it just bogs you down. Pushing through fear has been the breakthrough I’ve needed in my life, and no one could do it for me. I feel like a different person. This may sound stupid, but maybe we all need to get punched in the face. We spend our modern lives constantly in the past, in the future, anxiety and existential dread about what is coming, what may come to pass, how will we deal with it, grief and loss, thinking about fucking money and relationships and housing. Go to a boxing gym, and spar with someone. Introduce some danger into your life. No one wants to get punched in the face. I guarantee you getting the shit beat out of you, and you doing the same to someone else, will have you in the moment. When you’re actively getting attacked, there is no time for anxiety or depression or grief. Just “do I duck left, or do I duck right”. Stop waiting for life to happen. Go out and do dangerous shit. I’m not advocating for being reckless. But my new philosophy is: if life is pointless, then the only rational response is to do whatever makes you feel most alive, regardless of social conventions or personal anxieties real or imagined reply",

          "text": "The book \"Halftime\" by Bob Buford helped me 'orgnanize' my thoughts/wishes/dreams/aspirations for the second half. I had a fair idea of what/why/where/when/how I wanted things to be in the 'second half', and it helped me ask the right questions in a useful order. I believe Peterson's \"Future Authoring\" does something similar, but I haven't tried it yet (perhaps this summer I can make the time to try it out). If you are journaling, go back and skim through your journals (older first --> recent last) and see the changes (and trajectory/future/outlook). (Depending on the language you read it) Hector Malot writes on En Famille: don't read newspapers, they are a waste of time. I try to stay away from the news, and listen to (few) podcasts much-much later to see if what they were saying \"1 day after the XYZ event\" actually played out or not\". That gives a better measure/perspective of how much trust to put in those people/discussions. reply",

          "text": "Try this: never read without a pencil in your hand. Make it a point to not only orally or mentally restate but also rewrite by hand everything you read (on-screen and in real life) in your own words, and to make multiple drafts of each restatement until it is as succinct, orderly, and logical as possible. This practice will probably help you: * recognize and stop reading low-value material; * read less on your phone; * deeply understand what you're reading; * identify errors in what you're reading; * identify errors in your own understanding; * improve your own writing (and possibly your handwriting!); * recall what you've read and what it says and means; and * build a record of your reading, reactions, and thinking. And, of course, I think it should improve your ability to focus. You can also make flashcards while you're at it (again, handwritten ones) and develop a spaced-repetition practice for the important information and skills. --- Later Edit --- You mention long-form text in particular. One of the most effective tactics to use while reading is to discern the writing's architecture/structure — at all levels, from the writing's genre, to its main components and their arrangement, to how each main part is composed, and so on. Doing so not only helps to understand and critique the author's ideas, but also becomes a fun game that keeps your attention directed. And also keep in mind that > 99% of all writing is not only not great but also probably not worth reading in the first place. It's ok to use boredom as a guide: your mind may be indicating through boredom and distraction that what you're reading isn't worth the time and effort and attention it takes to do so. But if you have decided that you must read something, or that you want to read it and understand it, then I've found that there's no substitute for the handwriting technique.

          "text": "Well, physicality is part of the point: it slows the writer down and provides more engagement with text (with the text being read; and the text representing the reader's ideas about the text being read; and the text representing the reader's ideas about text representing the reader's (prior) ideas about the text being read). Furthermore, handling, pushing around, and organizing actual paper on an actual desktop has (in my experience) effects on the mind that are both different in kind and superior in degree to those achieved by merely thinking, speaking, or typing about something. The availability and simplicity are part of the point too: pencils and paper are ubiquitous; and easily found and inexpensively purchased if not immediately available. Written jots and drafts of ideas, summaries, and reactions (of the kind we're talking about here) are easy and quick to make; they readily reveal their content; and they're easy and quick to view simultaneously, to rearrange, to stack, reorder, organize, store, and share. Compare voice recorders: the devices are not ubiquitous and are costly; they break and are costly to repair or replace; they have many dependencies (batteries/charging/charging plugs; switches prone to failure; firmware; drivers; USB plugs or adapters that can become missing, damaged, or obsolete themselves); etc. And compare the audio tapes or audio files: they don't really and fully reveal their content by glancing at them; they're hard to keep track of; and they're more difficult to change or reorganize. All that said, I think voice recorders have a place and I use a dictaphone myself on occasion — but primarily to spit out several ideas quickly when time is of the essence, I'm afraid I'll lose the thoughts, or I can't find the words to describe them in writing but somehow can blab about the gist of them to create a sort of bookmark for later processing. But then I have to remember to check to see if I have audio files of orally recorded thoughts to process and then either transfer the files to my computer for transcription and printing, or else listen to the audio files and write the thoughts down myself. <Inevitably: oops, I forgot I had these; oops, device isn't here or isn't charged when I need it; oops, Wi-Fi is on the fritz; oops, I want to reorder, reword, or cross out some of these thoughts but not others, and I can't remember or retain in working memory the whole of my spoken audio to restate it all from scratch; etc.> In a way, doing it by hand avoids the same type of virtualization problems I experience when budgeting and spending and tracking money: doing it physically instead of by computer keeps or makes it \"more real\" to my mind, and I seem to make better decisions and fewer errors. That benefit alone more than makes up for any time supposedly lost in doing it by hand: slow is smooth, and smooth is fast. -- Later Edit --- The slower pace of writing by hand is also a big help because it acts as a filter. I find it helps me to filter out low-value reading (because I easily perceive when analyzing, summarizing, and reacting to something in handwriting would not be a fun or beneficial use of my time). And I find that it helps me filter out my own thoughts (because writing out the less-important ones would similarly take too great a share of the time and energy I have to spend). reply",

          "text": "First of all, listen to your body and calm down. I've been to an otolaryngologist recently because of recurrent dizzy spells. The test results were all good, and the diagnosis was simple: I've been unconsciously flexing my muscles and clenching my teeth. The advice was to build consciousness to this and actively relax. I've then realized that with that flexed state a kind of mental flex follows. I got used to this kind of stressed-out context switching that put my brain in a racing thought state. Noticing when this happens and consciously stopping and then actively releasing the bodily pressure has been an important step in regaining control of my brain.\nI've realized that I kind of conditioned myself to this kind of dopamine seeking that persisted regardless of the medium I'd consume. I'm >30 and therefore skipped the TikTok phase, but even as I got rid of the Instagram habit (it helps that the algorithm is really poor at predicting content I'd want to watch) I would find myself doing the same kind of short bursts of short-term attention and immediate switch even with text-based media such as Reddit or Wikipedia. Try to capture your mental state when you are in this \"mindless consumption\" mode and learn to identify it. Develop a habit to notice when this happens and then stop and ask yourself what are you chasing, after all. Try to pause at the content you're currently reading and read it till the end once you calm down. It also helps to find books that keep your brain active while being engaging to you. I've had a lifelong passion for linguistics and I found myself digging into language philosophy, for example. This is the kind of literature that keeps me engaged, but forces me to slow down as well to think and properly process what I've read. Your mileage may vary; we are different people and definitely you have different interests than me. While I'm not a fantasy fan, I'd be a little wary of picking up fantasy books. My observations tell that the most successful ones read like action movies or first-person video games, and fast-paced action is something you want to steer away from for the purpose of this exercise. Pick up something that challenges you a bit, but is still comprehensible with the context you have right now. reply",

One very simple thing is to just scan your page really fast, jumping one word towards the beginning of the line -> one word towards the end, maybe skipping every other line. Try to vaguely notice these words, but really just move fast. Do that for like 20-30s. Then go back and read at normal speed, it generally feels much slower and you get more details. It's the analogous of coming out of the highway and having the feeling that you're now driving super slow. Note: I can't read fast, I'm not affiliated to speed reading philosophies, I know that speed reading is not just the trick above, but here and there I use it to (re)gain focus and for me it works. reply",

          "text": "Wear a high-quality mask like a KF94 or N95 in public and filter your air. I have been struggling with similar issues. Although writing this alone was a struggle for me, I hope I can offer some helpful advice and information, and I tried my best so bear with me! Reading this will be a nice workout for your brain at the least. --- The pandemic never ended- it just changed shape. The virus keeps changing, and acute symptoms may fade. But for many, the infection never truly ends. A major new review from Yale (Moen, Baker, Iwasaki) offers a comprehensive picture into the neuroimmune pathophysiology of long COVID. Common neurological symptoms in Long COVID include new onset cognitive difficulties, dysautonomia, fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy. Neurological difficulties resulting from COVID infection include reductions in attention span and difficulty maintaining focus for extended periods of time. The brain gets sick from COVID, even when standard scans appear \"normal\". PET imaging has shown reduced glucose metabolism in the brainstem, limbic inflammation, microglia digesting synapses. This is well documented at this point, but here's the link to the Yale study in mention: ttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40536011/ SO MASK UP! COVID is an airborne infectious disease that causes systemic organ damage, including in the brain. -- According to Dr. Michael Hoerger, Director of Pandemic Mitigation Collaborative of Tulane University, latest data shows the current average number of COVID infections per person is at 3.77 as of last week (6/16/25). Pair that with the fact that damage from COVID infections are cumulative and each infection increases your chance of noticeable long-term effects, there's a good chance your issues may stem from COVID-related damage. That's why I recommend to mask indoors to protect your brain from further cognitive damage. You want to reduce the amount of times you get infected as much as possible. Masking is an easy step. If you need access to free masks, check here to get connected with a local group: https://maskbloc.org/ Again, wear a mask! Check if you can get into a long-covid clinic (difficult in many places, I realize) for a neurological evaluation. There are brain exercises and a combination of medication treatments that may be able to help. From another article on a study (I'm so sorry, I'll summarize & put link at bottom), apparently the brain exercise app called BrainHQ (brainhq.com) has shown statically significant cognitive function improvement in long COVID patients. \"The UAB study ... showed significant benefits in many secondary measures, including large to very large benefits on depressive, fatigue, and brain fog symptoms, as well as a significant benefit in brain processing speed, and a trend toward large benefits on anxiety symptoms. No significant change was noted in a measure of global cognition.\" Essentially, \"intensive, repetitive, and progressively challenging activities can drive beneficial changes to the brain.\" However, you do want to be careful with triggering fatigue and post-exertional malaise if you suffer from that, so pacing can be important. Sorry again for making so much reading for you, but I hope this helps. Mask up, eat well, and exercise your brain over time, find a specialist if you can, and things hopefully will get better. I've gotten a lot better with help. Feel free to reply if you have any questions! www.news-medical.net/news/20250505/Breakthrough-brain-training-shows-promise-for-Long-COVID-recovery.aspx reply",

          "text": "You’re definitely not alone “AI code loot box” is a great description! I’ve been experimenting with Claude Code (and the other major models) since late last year, and my success rate seems to track yours unless I’m deliberate about “prompt engineering” and workflow. Here are a few things that have helped me get better, more reliable results: 1. Be uncomfortably explicit in prompts:\nClaude Code in particular is very sensitive to ambiguity. When I write a prompt, I’ll often: Specify coding style, performance constraints, and even “avoid X library” if needed. Give sample input/output (even hand-written). Explicitly state: “Prefer simplicity and readability over cleverness.” 2. Break down problems more than feels necessary:\nIf I give Claude a 5-step plan and ask for code for the whole thing, it often stumbles. But if I ask for one function at a time, or have it generate stub functions first, then fill in each one, the output is much more solid. 3. Always get it to generate unit tests (and run them immediately):\nI now habitually ask:\n\"Write code that does X. Then, write at least 3 edge-case unit tests.\"\nEven if the code needs cleanup, the tests usually expose the gaps. 4. Plan mode can work, but human-tighten the plan first:\nI’ve found Claude’s “plan” sometimes overestimates its own reasoning ability. After it makes a plan, I’ll review and adjust before asking for code generation. Shorter, concrete steps help. 5. Use “summarize” and “explain” after code generation:\nIf I get a weird/hard-to-read output, I’ll paste it back and ask “Explain this block, step by step.” That helps catch misunderstandings early. Re: Parallelization and rate limits:\nI suspect most rate-limit hitters are power-users running multiple agents/tools at once, or scripting API calls. I’m in the same boat as you — the limiting factor is usually review/rework time, not the API. Last tip:\nI keep a running doc of prompts that work well and bad habits to avoid. When I start to see spurious/overly complex output, it’s nearly always because I gave unclear requirements or tried to do too much in one message. reply",

          "text": "To learn a folk style you really need a mentor that can connect you to the oral tradition. Rather than scales and technical exercises, focus on learning rhythm and complete pieces. If there is a flamenco dance school in your area, see if they offer guitar lessons and the opportunity to accompany dancers. Always remember: The notes are not necessarily the most important thing. That said, there's a lot of overlap between flamenco and traditional classical guitar, so learning classical pieces (particularly by Spanish composers) will help build your fingerstyle technique. Solo Guitar Playing by Frederick Noad was the book I used for classical practice when I was younger. Also check out pseudo-flamenco pieces that have been recorded by rock and country guitarists, like \"Mood for a Day\" and \"Malagueña\", and smooth flamenco crossover artists like Ottmar Liebert and Jesse Cook. You might find these too diluted from \"real\" flamenco, but they can be another entry point for building up your playing. reply",

If you want to listen to something I think very few people in the pop scene could replicate I would suggest listening to Paco De Lucia. Of course people like Al Di Meola who played with Paco were able to crossover into that world but he is a virtuoso in his own right. reply",

Honestly, it's a bit of a jerk move to date people to practice dating someone better. When people say they're unattractive, often it's not because they're ugly. Ugly is a disadvantage, but not the biggest one. For both men and women, it's usually because they lack confidence. Or they're boring. Or sleazy. If you're getting into a first date and not a second, you're likely attractive enough on the 'resume', just messing up on the actual date. You might be saying something wrong. You might be delivering a good joke the wrong way. Sometimes it's just saying things in the wrong order. The longer they go without some form of success, the less confident they become. I thought the diagnosis was fairly clear; sorry for jumping straight to pitching a cure. This is a good example of saying things in the wrong order. reply",

That you think LLMs are the cure to loneliness misses what a \"cure\" even looks like here. OP clearly writes well enough to get first dates - the issue isn't conversational content but likely body language, energy, presence, the thousand micro-signals that happen below conscious awareness. You can't chatbot your way into better posture or more relaxed eye contact. This is classic LLM wrapper syndrome. Someone has a hammer (conversational AI) so every problem looks like a nail (conversation optimization). But the actual failure mode here probably happens in the first thirty seconds of meeting, before anyone's even said anything substantive. Op would probably benefit more from something social like improv classes (physical presence, spontaneity), dance lessons (body awareness, comfort with proximity), or honestly just hanging out in social spaces doing things they actually enjoy rather than performing \"date behaviors.\" The energy of someone genuinely engaged in something they love is magnetic in ways that no amount of conversation optimization can replicate. I just don't believe that \"practice talking to a computer\" will ever be a sufficient platform to teach people how to be genuinely charming, let alone charmingly genuine. reply",

Hence, why the construction took a halt during 1 year. They were selling at a discount to break even, the government was indeed talking about opening borders (we were already inside Thailand at that time, not buying from abroad). We visited the construction site and saw ~10 workers, everything seemed real, like a thing slowly getting back to normal. I have all the reasons to believe now, that these \"workers\" were just paid to be here.

          "text": "Yes, the company I work for has started using Hololens 2. We have a program that can overlay the 3D models from our CAD program onto the physical steel assemblies for QC. When it works, it works well and enables our quality checkers to perform checks faster and more accurately than using tape measures while going back and forth looking at a 2D drawing printed on 11 x 17 paper. The biggest hurdles is that none of the large companies think there is enough profit to be made from AR. The Hololens 2 is the only headset on the market both capable of running the program required while also being safe to use in a active shop enviroment (VR with passthrough is not suitable). Unfortunately the Hololens 2 is almost 6 years old as is being stretched to the absolute limits of its hardware capabilities. The technology is good but feels like it is only 90% of the way to where it needs to be. Even a simple revision with double the RAM and faster more power efficient processor would alleviate many of the issues we've experienced. Ultimately from what I've seen, AR is about making the human user better at their job and there are tons of industries where it could have many applications, but tech companies don't actually want to make things that could be directly useful to people that work with their hands, so instead we will just continue to toss more money at AI hoping to make ourselves obsolete. reply",

In order to keep the hologram steady and anchored you need to perform a mapping process so that the helmet recognizes both the physical steel assembly and a bit of the surrounding area to keep it steady when moving around. The 8GB of RAM puts a limit on the amount of mapping data that can be stored putting a limit of the size of assembly you can work with, and since the mapping process relies on using the helmets own software that has not been work on in years it is extremely sensitive to any sort of background movement, which means it works best in as controlled of a environment as possible. Right now we are just using it for special projects that are complex and have little margin for error.

A heads up display is just looking at the blueprint on a piece of paper with an additional layer of complexity, it wouldn't remove the need to manually measure, nor would it provide any assistance in spotting missing attached pieces (or some extra pieces). Once the model is overlayed QC goes from having to measure the placement of every pieces and the location of every hole to just walking around the finished assembly and ensuring that every conforms to the civil engineer approved model. A half hour process can be done faster and more precisely in 5 minutes, you notices very quickly when there is solid steel where the hologram has a hole, or thin air where the hologram shows that a plate was suppose to be welded on. reply",

          "text": "We work with all of the large general contractors in the steel construction industry. Right now, it's turned into one contract, but we are the second company the client has employed since the first company they hired failed to produce a single assembly that met their requirements. The client was the one that originally was using this tech since they wanted a way to do their own QC after the first experience, and we decided it was worth while pursuing ourselves since successfully pulling this project off while be a HUGE boost to our reputation. The construction industry is all about your portfolio of past projects. QA is the big sales point of the software we are using, but there are many other  potential applications for the same product. It should be possible to overlay the model on the main assembly prefab then use that to quickly mark where holes should be drilled and additional pieces attached. The other potential application that is being explored is using the holographic overlays to construct things out of the usual order, instead of building part 1 then starting part 2 since it needs to be built to conform to the first part you can instead build around the hologram so that your not relying on the previously built parts to ensure your angles are correct. I agree about the chicken/egg problem. Its an emerging technology where the payoff might be a decade away, customers need software that will actually benefit them, developers need reliable hardware capable of running software that has practical uses, and hardware companies want to know there is a customer base. The issue is AR falls under the category of product that the customer does not know they actually want, so the only way it is going to be developed is if one of the hardware manufactures takes a leap of faith and makes the long term investment. Sadly, I feel like AR is a million dollar idea with practical uses that has to contend with a business climate where you can make billions making some doodad that collects private data then displays ads to the masses. reply",

The past decade of devices (hololens, realwear, google glass, vuzix, etc) were some combination of way too heavy, expensive, fragile, short battery life, no wifi connectivity, too much UI long to get to point of value and/or simply not useful. That and most customers had a content problem. The AR/VR use in the field typically came down to looking something up in a manual or calling someone. Both easily and perhaps more effectively done on a smartphone. There was an instance where I asked techs why they weren't using the headset for showing what they were seeing in realtime and they said, it's easier to facetime (hard to argue that). The cool AR 3-D demos or overlays rarely worked in the field on real equip or didn't actually convey anything useful (everyone knows the basics of how the machine works). There are training VR use cases (like learning to operate a crane), but once again it's a nice to have supplement and not a replacement. Recent advances with LLMs (specifically voice) + Meta type \"glasses form factor\" have created intrigue again with innovation centers at large companies. The use case we're currently working on is inspections or filling out forms with audio/videos. reply",

That's pretty interesting, do you even need a screen, or just voice? I would think a pretty quick-and-dirty way to do it is to take pdf forms, enumerate (put small numbers) next to every editable field, and then use voice commands like, \"write the following in field 3: ....\" The purpose of having a screen would be to verify what the LLM + voice is inputting in the form.

My second most ergonomic situation is a 120\" screen with two 55\" screens tilting in from both sides (both in portrait, so all 3 screen verticals line up). All wall mounted. I started wall mounting to get screens off my desk, at which point it was clear bigger was always better. But for the Vision it took many rounds of trying third party head gear, and customization, before I could wear it comfortably for unlimited time. I just kept trying things until I got there. I am an obsessive optimist when it comes to ergonomics. Once the Vision is ergonomic for one's head, then it becomes a super ergonomic solution over all. The screen can be wherever you need it for best neck, back and body posture, whether at a desk, couch, (non-driving) car seat, or in bed. And a very wide screen beats any screen patchwork. Although I would like the Vision even more if I could have more than one Mac driven screen when I wanted to. (Recommend expansion batteries that clip on the original, and round magnetic USB-C cable adapters, for more spontaneous mobility.) I like the standard Apple straps in a pinch.

One thing I think is interesting about it is I don’t need my reading glasses, whereas I very much do when looking at a real monitor.  I find the virtual display setup somewhat intolerable for other reasons, though, like the inflexibility about how the displays are arranged, and there’s the physical bit about having a bulky HMD on. reply",

The increased focal distance seems to help, but the nose piece is weirdly designed and the pressure under the pads becomes a little painful after an hour or two. Also the field of view is too wide and so the edges are blurry (hard to see clock, corner buttons in fullscreen windows, health bar in video games, etc). Worked great to avoid eye fatigue/posture issues on airplanes though. I'm happy I have them, but in hindsight I'd have gotten a Viture or something with a better nose bridge and a narrower field of view. reply",

Tips: Get an upgraded headband, silicone face cover and carrying case. Use a physical USB connection for lower latency (& turn off the wifi/bluetooth as it's no longer needed). Bring a cloth for keeping the lenses clean. Bump the Retina quality up in the Immersed client (on Mac). Lower resolutions (1920x1080) are more comfortable to use over longer periods. Use a travel neck pillow for reclined usage. Bring replacement batteries and a charger for the controllers. reply",

          "text": "Not them, but I have one. I love it for movies or gaming where I can lay down and easily readjust it, but it's just no good for sitting/standing over long periods. It's not actually the weight. I have a Quest 3 with a BoboVR head strap, external battery, etc that all add up to be heavier than the AVP, but I can easily go for multi-hour social sessions with that on without any physical discomfort. You can put a ton of weight on your head with perfect comfort as long as it's balanced properly. The AVP's real problem is that its ergonomics are just shit. As with a bunch of other things, they designed for the ads instead of actual usability, so it's significantly worse than headsets that are actually much heavier, and the earband design with the way-too-far-back connectors and no top connections makes it nigh impossible for third parties to improve on it. The closest thing I've seen to making it comfortable is the third-party ResMed Kontor headstrap, and that's being produced in such low numbers that it's functionally impossible to actually buy. reply",

First responders and retailers have some of the largest internal deployments out there, but they aren’t massively publicized (most people would never guess who’s fielding the largest fleet of headsets right now). That said, it’s still not mass adoption. At the end of the day, you are asking someone to put something on their face that is still very different ergonomically than glasses (and I’m not sure even glasses would overcome enough friction). The ROI has to overcome the business (or personal) friction of buying the hardware, the friction of the form factor plus any friction from changed workflows. Now put that in an operational workflow instead of training and the risks go up. Most are still skeptical of device reliability (not to say there aren’t suitable devices for operational roles but the perception is still a hurdle, and the applicability is often device-specific). Now add on to that limited experience with devices (many decision makers have never put one on), added security complications, specialized software development skills, limited content libraries and very real accessibility concerns and a lot of enterprises can never get past an “innovation center demo.” For many industries the value proposition just isn’t there yet. But that said, I’d recommend digging a little deeper as there’s a lot of existing use-cases and deployments, both failed and successful, outside of IVAS. reply",

          "text": "Hello! I spent a lot of time in graduate school researching AR/VR technology (specifically regarding its utility as an accessibility tool) and learning about barriers to adoption. In my opinion, there are three major hurdles preventing widespread adoption of this modality: 1. *Weight*: To achieve powerful computation like that of the HoloLens, you need powerful processing. The simplest solution to this is to put the processing in the device, which adds weight to it. The HoloLens 2 weighs approximately 566g (or 1.24lb), which is a LOT of weight compared to a pair of traditional glasses, which weigh approximately 20-50g. Speaking as someone who developed with the HL2 for a few years, all-day wear with the device is uncomfortable and untenable. The weight of the device HAS to be comfortable for all-day use, otherwise it hinders adoption. 2. *Battery*: Ironically, making the device smaller to accommodate all-day wear means that you're simultaneously reducing its battery life, which reduces its utility as an all-day wearable: any onboard battery must be smaller, and thus store less energy. This is a problematic trade-off: you don't want the device to weigh too much that people can't wear it, but you also don't want the device to weigh too little that it ceases to have function. 3. *Social Acceptability*: This is where I have some expertise, as it was the subject of my research. Simply put, if a wearer feels as though they stand out by wearing an XR device, they're hesitant to wear it at all when interacting with others. This means that an XR device must not be ostentatious, as the Apple Vision Pro, HoloLens, MagicLeap, and Google Glass all were. In recent years, there have been a lot of strides in this space, but there's a long way to go. Firstly, there is increasingly an understanding that the futuristic devices we see in sci-fi cannot be achieved with onboard computation (yet). That said, local, bidirectional, wireless streaming between a lightweight XR device (glasses) and a device with stronger processing power (a la smartphone) provides a potential weigh of offloading computation from the device itself, and simply displaying results onboard. Secondly, Li+ battery tech continues to improve, and there are now [simple head-worn displays capable of rendering text and bitmaps]( https://www.vuzix.com/products/z100-smart-glasses ) with a battery life of an entire day. There is also active development work by the folks at [Mentra (YC W25)]( https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/mentra ) on highlighting these devices' utility, even with their limited processing power. Lastly, with the first two developments combined, social acceptability is improving dramatically! There are lots of new head-worn displays emerging with varying levels of ability. There was the recent [Android XR keynote]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nv1snJRCEI ), which shows some impressive spatial awareness, as well as the [Mentra Live]( https://mentra.glass/pages/live ) (an open-source Meta Raybans clone). In terms of limited displays with social acceptability, there are the [Vuzix Z100]( https://www.vuzix.com/products/z100-smart-glasses ), and [Even Realities G1]( https://www.evenrealities.com/g1 ), which can display basic information (that still has a lot of utility!). As an owner of the Vuzix Z100 and a former developer in the XR space, the progress is slow, but steady. The rapid improvements in machine learning (specifically in STT, TTS, and image understanding) indirectly improve the AR space as well. reply",

          "text": "We’ve developed VR based industrial safety training, as a self-contained, portable product for blue collar workers in India - launched about 24 months ago with regular updates. Multiple companies have bought it, and we have large companies as clients who’ve used it to train 1000s of their blue-collar workers, even in sectors such as construction in a relatively challenging (in terms of pricing and value) market. We have a significant (I think!) number of devices deployed, and most of my clients end up purchasing more after the initial purchase and pilot. I think that’s for a few reasons: 1) VR, when well designed, can offer 1st person experience of being an accident victim due to the viewer’s own oversight / someone else’s oversight. That makes it a far more effective way to draw the learner’s attention to the importance of the safety protocols, etc. 2) Our solution is multi-lingual: it’s currently available in 10 regional Indian languages - that matters, since a significant fraction of the workforce may not understand English. Our localisation extends beyond that, but language is a big thing in enabling access and usage. 3) if you have to invest 10-15 min per learner (often one-on-one as the instructor) to onboard each learner before they can use your solution, it becomes very difficult to scale and raises the bar for cost-effectiveness. So that’s something we focus on heavily. 4) Setup time- don’t create a solution that requires IT support, someone who understands how to setup / load SteamVR / Oculus Link / meta Horizon. If the solution adds 20-30 min workload to the staff on a site, then adopting it becomes that much more painful - so we’ve worked very hard to develop an integrated system where the instructor can quickly onboard 10-15 learners and get going with the session in 5 min. 5) workflow changes: often, introducing VR means changing some part of the organisation’s workflow - many VR solutions don’t consider this / acknowledge this in their design- clients get initially excited, but when it comes to actually using it on a daily basis, the deployment and workflow frictions can completely tank VR adoption. I’ve seen multiple solutions fail because of this, and we focus extensively on this when we design our solutions. India is a hard market for VR, honestly because it’s very price sensitive. But I think we’ve made some progress here, because we’ve focused extensively on system robustness, ease of deployment, localization, and a lot of user-centered design. We’ve also developed sophisticated VR - based training solutions for SOP training. VR can be / is, very effective for initial onboarding and SOP training. Again, the challenge here is usability - most of the learner’s don’t know how to use the controllers. Learning how to use the controllers is not easy and takes time. So that onboarding is critical and needs to be done well. In SOP training, our experience is that it can, if designed well, significantly reduce on-boarding time; however, you still need the last 20% of training on the actual thing for it to stick, and for the learner to actually _learn_.

          "text": "AR is much harder as a solution to deploy at scale, I think. First off, most solutions work poorly out in day light - especially the bright Indian sun. So that automatically adds friction in terms of deployment opportunities / field deployment. The second issue is the limited FoV: 40-45 degrees. That's a pretty small display area to play with in terms of pushing detailed information, etc. Third, again, the usability, ruggedness and user-onboarding challenges. So, the use case has to be important enough and significant enough that the user / organization needs to accept all these frictions and still derive enough value out of the solution - that leaves very few use cases. Add to that, HoloLens is expensive, hasn’t seen any significant development in the past few years, and real wear type devices too aren’t cheap for large scale adoption - a smartphone / tablet in hand is often a better / more maintainable / cost effective solution even compared to real wear - I’ve seen clients securely mount a smartphone on their helmet and setup a teams call for remote viewing - it works! reply",

We ended up added better metrics surrounding IO and the event loop which lead to us batch dequeuing our jobs in a more reasonable way that made the entire application much more effective.

          "text": "What are your processes waiting on? in Linux top, show the WCHAN field. In FreeBSD top, look at the STATE field. Ideally, your service processes are waiting on i/o (epoll, select, kqread, etc) or you're CPU limited. Is there any cross-room communication? Can you spawn a process per room? Scaling limited at 25% CPU on a 4 vcpu node strongly suggests a locked section limiting you to effectively single threaded performance. Multiple processes serving rooms should bypass that if you can't find it otherwise, but maybe there's something wrong in your load balancing etc. Personally, I'd rather run with fewer layers, because then you don't have to debug the layers when you have perf issues. Do matchmaking wherever with whatever layers, and let your room servers run in the host os, no containers. But nobody likes my ideas. :P Edit to add: your network load is tiny. This is almost certainly something with your software, or how you've setup your layers. Unless those vCPUs are ancient , you should be able to push a whole lot more packets. reply",

          "text": "So when running `top` WCHAN shows `ep_poll` most of the time and sometimes `-`. Even when the game starts lagging this pattern stays pretty consistent. There is no cross-room communication. I could spawn a process per room but I was trying to address this issue with my current Docker setup where I have multiple `game` containers that run a single node.js process and each process can host multiple rooms. Not having to use Docker sounds simpler but it's that's where I'm at atm haha. I agree that the network load feels very small. Maybe it's a socket.io related issue where when many broadcasts are being fired at once, then a shared I/O step gets bottlenecked? Here's my actual typing broadcast code, I was originally broadcasting from the socket event callback itself but I found performance improved slightly by batching broadcasts per player in a setInterval loop (also note that only 1 player in a given room can be typing at once, so batching broadcasts per room shouldn't address the bottleneck). /**\n   * Used to handle very frequent typing events more gracefully to avoid overloading CPU\n   */\n  const TypingUsersMap = new Map<\n    ConnectionId,\n    {\n      socketId: string | null; // doesn't exist for bots\n      roomId: PublicRoomId;\n      userId: UserId;\n      currentInput: string;\n    }\n  >();\n\n  type ConnectionId = `${UserId}:${PublicRoomId}`;\n\n  // ! this should be same as client throttle interval\n  const TYPING_BROADCAST_INTERVAL = 200;\n\n  export let typingBroadcastInterval: NodeJS.Timeout | undefined = undefined;\n  export const startTypingBroadcastJob = () => {\n    typingBroadcastInterval = setInterval(() => {\n      const freshTypingUsersMap = new Map(TypingUsersMap);\n      TypingUsersMap.clear();\n\n      if (freshTypingUsersMap.size === 0) return; // Nothing to do\n\n      // Go through each user that has a pending update\n      for (const [_connectionId, data] of freshTypingUsersMap.entries()) {\n        const socket = data.socketId\n          ? io.sockets.sockets.get(data.socketId)\n          : undefined;\n\n        // Use the data we stored to perform the broadcast\n        if (socket) {\n          // emit to other players\n          socket\n            .to(data.roomId)\n            .volatile.emit(\n              SOCKET_EVENT_NAMES.USER_TYPING_RES,\n              data.userId,\n              data.currentInput\n            );\n        } else {\n          // bots emit to everyone\n          io.to(data.roomId).volatile.emit(\n            SOCKET_EVENT_NAMES.USER_TYPING_RES,\n            data.userId,\n            data.currentInput\n          );\n        }\n      }\n    }, TYPING_BROADCAST_INTERVAL);\n  };\n\n  export const stopTypingBroadcastJob = () => {\n    if (typingBroadcastInterval) {\n      clearInterval(typingBroadcastInterval);\n      typingBroadcastInterval = undefined;\n    }\n  };\n\n  // this is called from the USER_TYPING socket event callback. so effectively every throttled keystroke by the user gets queued.\n  export const queueTypingEvent = ({\n    socketId,\n    roomId,\n    userId,\n    currentInput,\n  }: {\n    socketId: string | null;\n    roomId: PublicRoomId;\n    userId: UserId;\n    currentInput: string;\n  }) => {\n    const connectionId: ConnectionId = `${userId}:${roomId}`;\n    TypingUsersMap.set(connectionId, {\n      socketId,\n      roomId,\n      userId,\n      currentInput,\n    });\n  }; reply",

Though Apple's lack of native 3rd party search engine support has been annoying, and it requires various hacks from Kagi to make it work. That's my only gripe, but that's on Apple. The hardest things for me have been email and maps. The switching cost for email, especially one I've had since the gmail beta, is astronomically high. I don't think I will ever be able to fully delete the account (though I did delete about 5 alt email accounts I had with Gmail). Maps has also been hard, as Google Maps is my go-to place for business information and reviews. I use Apple Maps for actual navigation, but their POI and business data is severely lacking, and the lean on Yelp doesn't cut it. Kagi maps is being developed, but has a long way to go, and to get to the point of Google Maps... I don't think they have keep enough pockets for that. And there is YouTube of course, which is Google owned. There is really no good alternative for that. reply",

Proton Pass is nice, but the ‘drive’ feature doesn’t have anything remotely close to what the Google Drive / Docs / Sheets / Slides ecosystem has. It also seems relatively new, so we’ll revisit it in a few months hopefully. We also tested out Microsoft teams, and no, just no. It’s just really convenient to onboard employees and the browser management with chrome is ultimately the deciding factor, as well as not having to worry about email deliverability. I feel like there is a somewhat big market for someone who wants to take on the Google workspace / MS teams products. For the most part, I feel like this wouldn’t be difficult to build besides the email deliverability part being most crucial. Along with forking chromium or Firefox and reimplementing the browser management system, which also can maybe be done with an extension. reply",

Communications, medical, education, e-commerce for anything/everything. We get to play in a lot of different playgrounds and potentially have a huge impact. I don’t think I’ll ever get tired of that. I am tired of the interview process. Here’s a take home assignment that you’ll code in isolation without feedback or interaction from us. Completely opposite of how you’d do the job. You’ll have to justify any assumptions you make. And if we don’t like your justification, pass. Took 2 days on the assignment - this is kind of simplistic, not what we’d expect from a senior dev. Pass. Take 4 days on the assignment - what took so long? We’d expect a senior dev to knock this out in 2 or 3 days. Pass. Maybe we’ll tell you’re out. Or we’ll just ghost you. Depends on how our recruiting team is feeling that day. Behavioral is generally where I “blow” it. I won’t lie and answer the “so tell me a time about xyz”. Sometimes xyz was terrible, and I didn’t handle it well. I know how I’d handle it now and can articulate that. Sorry. We’re looking for someone that handled this exactly right already. Personally I screwed myself over the years by not chasing titles. I’ve done Staff and Principal level stuff. For years. But I didn’t fight for the title. So I generally get screened out of those pretty quickly because past titles don’t match what recruiting team has been told to look for. But this is the price that must be paid. So I can work/play in a lot of different playgrounds. Keep applying. Keep trying. Eventually I’ll find something. reply",

I realized that the depression I was experiencing was caused entirely by leadership, not my job. No matter which products I worked on, the same feelings of depression and ultimately loathing of the environment and process kept returning. Don't get me wrong. My employer is world-class, and the benefits were amazing, but the software development and engineering culture are destroying their employees. A sabbatical to rethink my career is in order. I've saved for the past 20 years and realized that unless I take time now, I might never have the real opportunity to enjoy life the way I’ve dreamed. I now have two years of savings set aside, so we will see where life takes me. I might work for myself or simply step down from technology development into a new role. Modern software engineering is killing its employees. Global teams across time zones working from 5:00am to 10:00pm., on projects that aren’t even mine—just because someone else left and needed someone competent to pick up the slack and carry the project to completion. Leaders overpromise and commit to deadlines without even asking if the solutions are feasible. Being reprimanded when you push back and say that the solution they just promised isn’t realistic or even possible. reply",

The main advantage is that under this arrangement the people who are your bosses, or otherwise rule over that you do, in a normal corporate job, such as sales people and accountants, become your employees and have to answer to you and your peers. Technical merit and knowledg becomes the driving force, not fantasy sales pitches and bean counting. The main downside, besides the business risk, is likely going to be lower pay.

The workload was low, so I made my own work and got into Facilities work, learned how to check the fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, and elevators. -And you know what? I opened up some of the smoke detectors and detected prior smoke in them; visual charring and melted plastic. The smoke detectors had been recalled for catching fire.

You're experiencing what people in every other industry have dealt with for generations: being treated as a disposable cost center when it's convenient for ownership. The solution isn't individual resilience or '''grinding harder''', it's collective action. Tech workers need to organize. We need unions. We need to stop pretending that stock options and ping pong tables make us anything other than workers whose interests are fundamentally opposed to those who fire us on a whim to boost quarterly numbers. The people who laid you off, who are outsourcing jobs, who are trying to replace workers with AI — they are not on your side! They never were!

Yes to the first part, it's just like code. Write once, then run it perpetually. Except that isn't really the case. There are still jobs for maintaining COBOL systems. Likewise, legacy hardware needs to be replaced, improved, or repaired. Old companies die, new ones swoop in and capture market share. My employer is the only manufacturer I know of for a legacy system component. They have a captive market because no one else wants to take the two weeks in CAD, and phone time with the contract manufacturers. This kind of thing is everywhere. > So it is a natural evolution that software is becoming automated. Again, yes, but no. We automate things as a matter of course. We are engineers. This doesn't mean fewer jobs, it means a shifting job market. IE loom operator vs hand weaver. reply",

They definitely can't pay inflated Silicon Valley salaries, but I'm also at much less risk of getting that pink slip when some far-off executive decides I'm extraneous.

          "text": "Hard not to feel this way sometimes given the quality of some job listings and the negativity bias here and broader media. In such moments of despair I recall two axioms: change is inevitable and ongoing, and talent rarely resides in the C-suite. I'm only 10 years in and currently at a science non-profit using a dead/toy framework, and honestly woefully unprepared for market at the moment. I'm constantly looking at job listings, though, and engaging with scads of recruiters to maintain a good feel for the market to inform my next steps. I see plenty of ads that are hyper-specific about the tooling du-jour, but a non-trivial percentage of the listings I see make it clear that higher-level prowess, like understanding a language and best practices, are more important than what ultimately boils down to the ability to RTFM for whatever widgets the CTO/CE is currently enamored with. These are the jobs I'm looking at. Sure, this could narrow your pool during what appears to be a tight market, but you're more likely to have worthwhile interviews. I'll apply to less intriguing jobs to avoid getting rusty at interviewing, though. This kind of funk also inevitably drives me harder to just _do what I want to do_. What language and tools _do I want to use_? _What kind of problems do I want to solve_ moving forward? If you've sorted these out, great. Sure, this could _also_ narrow your pool even more, but you're more likely to find a high-quality match. Finally, all of these companies foaming at the mouth to replace people with AI will regret it; it's already happening, in fact. It's happening in less/non-technical jobs (lol Klarna), so I'm not worried about coding jobs at all in the long run (not to diminish and current or short term turbulence, though). Smart execs/founders will see AI for what it is: a force multiplier, only as good as your existing staff. That said, I think it behooves devs to get right with AI/chat-assisted development. Of all the buzzy tools people fall in love with, I think this is the highest ROI I've seen yet. TL;DR: I'm just not going to apply to jobs that don't give me \"smart exec\" smells, and I'm only applying if it really looks like something I'll care about doing. I realize this exudes some degree of privilege, hubris, and/or naivete, but I work my ass off and you only live once. reply",

An accountant, proper CPA, needs like 5-10 hours of training per year to keep on top of their industry. IT? Are we on mainframes? no we moved to individual pcs? I mean we moved to the mainframe in the cloud? No we moved to individual ai on GPUs? No we moved to the ai in the cloud? IT is constantly changing and 10 hours per day of training isnt enough and if you're caught on Y framework when the industry moved on from that framework. Then you're SOL.

It's toxic in a very passive-aggressive way (rather than reddit toxic, which is just aggressive). I've been at this since 1988. (Made a few personal bad choices so not retired, lol [2]) I've changed jobs every 5-7 years since the post-2000 implosion. Don't bother with the FAANGs, its all style over substance tossing-off investors: they don't care about you at all and their top level management just want to be centibillionaires (or trillionaires). Find smaller companies, that's what I started doing 20 years ago. I started a new job as a senior director at a 5000 person company 3 years ago, most money I've ever made in my career, great people who enjoy their work, no pressure to move up the ladder unless you want to (not much ladder for me, but the younger devs are happy to stay put without the dumb pressure to give 150% every year). Our revenue is <10B, and it is a German company so there's minimal (unremarkable) equity, but the base salary is great. Find a company that makes boring products that sell. Mine is a stable boring company, making real-ware silicon products and associated cloud services for medical and automotive industry. Look for a company trying to grow profits at a normal rate, not a FAANG rate. Avoid the hype. Be boring. Slow and steady. [1] also, if you're only in tech because you think that's where you're supposed to be, and don't have a deep passion for it, you're gonna have a bad time.

Also, this startup image (which persisted to these being big companies) of them being employee-friendly, maverick and casual was really just a function of the boom times. That veneer is long gone. We are now in the era of permanent layoffs to suppress wages and every one of us that can be replaced by AI will be. I think for many tech workers, they're in for a rude awakening that they're just like any other worker and not special or somehow immune to the adversarial nature of the employer-employee relationship. Back in 2000 and 2008 it took sa few years but the jobs came back. One might assume that'll happen again but I'm honestly not so sure. 2008 saw the elimination of a whole class of entry-level professional jobs for millenials that never came back. Thing is, I don't think much of the economic activity in the tech sector is actually creating value anymore. Big tech are milking their respective golden geese until they inevitably die. Startups are largely just angling for a buyout in the AI gold rush that'll largely benefit the founders and the employees not so much. reply",

They need them in large teams (IT department of a larger university) down to solo devs (working for a single department at a small liberal arts college—this is where I've been for 15 years). It's true that you won't get the same level of pay—frankly, I've been woefully underpaid—but, by and large, they're not trying to replace everyone with AI, they adhere to basic standards of ethics, and they don't subscribe to crunch culture. If you're working in an academic department, chances are your bosses will basically think you're doing magic all the time and give you massive respect. Plus the job security is overall much higher.

I've worked with professional document translators for years, and compared their translation services with Google translate and Deep L. Translations are still quite bad with LLM's for niche or technical topics. There are borrowed words, words that only make sense to specific professions or used in the right context etc. Most translations suffer from overly literal translations between the English word and the target language word or phrase. Sentence structure, grammar, word choice, and industry research to find the common terms a 'topic-native' person would understand are all still very hard for LLM's to get consistently correct (and are the things that good professional translators do well). There's a chance for common topics that the general public would be familiar with, that LLM's can now translate well enough. For business or medical or technical writing it's still a bit varied in quality. reply",

          "text": "It's hard to say if you don't speak the language, but I think it translates to the wrong level of formality. Often too formal when asked to translate and too intimate when talking to a user in that language. They also get the tone all wrong. If you tell them what the tone should be like, they nail it. Often better than official human translations. Especially say, religious text. Some parts are meant to be heavy and grim, some are humor/sarcasm. But religious text often has that monotone thee/thou tone, especially in English. Which I feel is based out of a culture that places it distant, as something to be quoted instead of a proper story. I think it often misses out poetic bits. The order of language in German, like \"here comes me\" has a stronger and more poetic feel than the English \"here I come\". Haikus are supposed to bring a wabi-sabi feel of imperfection and impermanence, but in English they rarely carry over. Always prefer token pricing. None of the other forms of pricing really make sense to me; I guess they're just easiest for the VCs. reply",

They are better at responding but translation took a slight decline. You do need to give specific instructions on how to respond. Some of the cheaper ones seem to ignore instructions... GPT, Claude, Gemini, all three make this mistake. I also mean there's a lot of room for improved quality and nobody is tackling that either. \"And any idea why people still use GT/DeepL? Is it the speed and cost? Risk of hallucinations? Or some features LLMs miss?\" I guess for the reasons people use Wikipedia. GT is verified by humans, including some experts.

          "text": "Try this: never read without a pencil in your hand. Make it a point to not only orally or mentally restate but also rewrite by hand everything you read (on-screen and in real life) in your own words, and to make multiple drafts of each restatement until it is as succinct, orderly, and logical as possible. This practice will probably help you: * recognize and stop reading low-value material; * read less on your phone; * deeply understand what you're reading; * identify errors in what you're reading; * identify errors in your own understanding; * improve your own writing (and possibly your handwriting!); * recall what you've read and what it says and means; and * build a record of your reading, reactions, and thinking. And, of course, I think it should improve your ability to focus. You can also make flashcards while you're at it (again, handwritten ones) and develop a spaced-repetition practice for the important information and skills. --- Later Edit --- You mention long-form text in particular. One of the most effective tactics to use while reading is to discern the writing's architecture/structure — at all levels, from the writing's genre, to its main components and their arrangement, to how each main part is composed, and so on. Doing so not only helps to understand and critique the author's ideas, but also becomes a fun game that keeps your attention directed. And also keep in mind that > 99% of all writing is not only not great but also probably not worth reading in the first place. It's ok to use boredom as a guide: your mind may be indicating through boredom and distraction that what you're reading isn't worth the time and effort and attention it takes to do so. But if you have decided that you must read something, or that you want to read it and understand it, then I've found that there's no substitute for the handwriting technique.

          "text": "Well, physicality is part of the point: it slows the writer down and provides more engagement with text (with the text being read; and the text representing the reader's ideas about the text being read; and the text representing the reader's ideas about text representing the reader's (prior) ideas about the text being read). Furthermore, handling, pushing around, and organizing actual paper on an actual desktop has (in my experience) effects on the mind that are both different in kind and superior in degree to those achieved by merely thinking, speaking, or typing about something. The availability and simplicity are part of the point too: pencils and paper are ubiquitous; and easily found and inexpensively purchased if not immediately available. Written jots and drafts of ideas, summaries, and reactions (of the kind we're talking about here) are easy and quick to make; they readily reveal their content; and they're easy and quick to view simultaneously, to rearrange, to stack, reorder, organize, store, and share. Compare voice recorders: the devices are not ubiquitous and are costly; they break and are costly to repair or replace; they have many dependencies (batteries/charging/charging plugs; switches prone to failure; firmware; drivers; USB plugs or adapters that can become missing, damaged, or obsolete themselves); etc. And compare the audio tapes or audio files: they don't really and fully reveal their content by glancing at them; they're hard to keep track of; and they're more difficult to change or reorganize. All that said, I think voice recorders have a place and I use a dictaphone myself on occasion — but primarily to spit out several ideas quickly when time is of the essence, I'm afraid I'll lose the thoughts, or I can't find the words to describe them in writing but somehow can blab about the gist of them to create a sort of bookmark for later processing. But then I have to remember to check to see if I have audio files of orally recorded thoughts to process and then either transfer the files to my computer for transcription and printing, or else listen to the audio files and write the thoughts down myself. <Inevitably: oops, I forgot I had these; oops, device isn't here or isn't charged when I need it; oops, Wi-Fi is on the fritz; oops, I want to reorder, reword, or cross out some of these thoughts but not others, and I can't remember or retain in working memory the whole of my spoken audio to restate it all from scratch; etc.> In a way, doing it by hand avoids the same type of virtualization problems I experience when budgeting and spending and tracking money: doing it physically instead of by computer keeps or makes it \"more real\" to my mind, and I seem to make better decisions and fewer errors. That benefit alone more than makes up for any time supposedly lost in doing it by hand: slow is smooth, and smooth is fast. -- Later Edit --- The slower pace of writing by hand is also a big help because it acts as a filter. I find it helps me to filter out low-value reading (because I easily perceive when analyzing, summarizing, and reacting to something in handwriting would not be a fun or beneficial use of my time). And I find that it helps me filter out my own thoughts (because writing out the less-important ones would similarly take too great a share of the time and energy I have to spend). reply",

          "text": "First of all, listen to your body and calm down. I've been to an otolaryngologist recently because of recurrent dizzy spells. The test results were all good, and the diagnosis was simple: I've been unconsciously flexing my muscles and clenching my teeth. The advice was to build consciousness to this and actively relax. I've then realized that with that flexed state a kind of mental flex follows. I got used to this kind of stressed-out context switching that put my brain in a racing thought state. Noticing when this happens and consciously stopping and then actively releasing the bodily pressure has been an important step in regaining control of my brain.\nI've realized that I kind of conditioned myself to this kind of dopamine seeking that persisted regardless of the medium I'd consume. I'm >30 and therefore skipped the TikTok phase, but even as I got rid of the Instagram habit (it helps that the algorithm is really poor at predicting content I'd want to watch) I would find myself doing the same kind of short bursts of short-term attention and immediate switch even with text-based media such as Reddit or Wikipedia. Try to capture your mental state when you are in this \"mindless consumption\" mode and learn to identify it. Develop a habit to notice when this happens and then stop and ask yourself what are you chasing, after all. Try to pause at the content you're currently reading and read it till the end once you calm down. It also helps to find books that keep your brain active while being engaging to you. I've had a lifelong passion for linguistics and I found myself digging into language philosophy, for example. This is the kind of literature that keeps me engaged, but forces me to slow down as well to think and properly process what I've read. Your mileage may vary; we are different people and definitely you have different interests than me. While I'm not a fantasy fan, I'd be a little wary of picking up fantasy books. My observations tell that the most successful ones read like action movies or first-person video games, and fast-paced action is something you want to steer away from for the purpose of this exercise. Pick up something that challenges you a bit, but is still comprehensible with the context you have right now. reply",

          "text": "Wear a high-quality mask like a KF94 or N95 in public and filter your air. I have been struggling with similar issues. Although writing this alone was a struggle for me, I hope I can offer some helpful advice and information, and I tried my best so bear with me! Reading this will be a nice workout for your brain at the least. --- The pandemic never ended- it just changed shape. The virus keeps changing, and acute symptoms may fade. But for many, the infection never truly ends. A major new review from Yale (Moen, Baker, Iwasaki) offers a comprehensive picture into the neuroimmune pathophysiology of long COVID. Common neurological symptoms in Long COVID include new onset cognitive difficulties, dysautonomia, fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy. Neurological difficulties resulting from COVID infection include reductions in attention span and difficulty maintaining focus for extended periods of time. The brain gets sick from COVID, even when standard scans appear \"normal\". PET imaging has shown reduced glucose metabolism in the brainstem, limbic inflammation, microglia digesting synapses. This is well documented at this point, but here's the link to the Yale study in mention: ttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40536011/ SO MASK UP! COVID is an airborne infectious disease that causes systemic organ damage, including in the brain. -- According to Dr. Michael Hoerger, Director of Pandemic Mitigation Collaborative of Tulane University, latest data shows the current average number of COVID infections per person is at 3.77 as of last week (6/16/25). Pair that with the fact that damage from COVID infections are cumulative and each infection increases your chance of noticeable long-term effects, there's a good chance your issues may stem from COVID-related damage. That's why I recommend to mask indoors to protect your brain from further cognitive damage. You want to reduce the amount of times you get infected as much as possible. Masking is an easy step. If you need access to free masks, check here to get connected with a local group: https://maskbloc.org/ Again, wear a mask! Check if you can get into a long-covid clinic (difficult in many places, I realize) for a neurological evaluation. There are brain exercises and a combination of medication treatments that may be able to help. From another article on a study (I'm so sorry, I'll summarize & put link at bottom), apparently the brain exercise app called BrainHQ (brainhq.com) has shown statically significant cognitive function improvement in long COVID patients. \"The UAB study ... showed significant benefits in many secondary measures, including large to very large benefits on depressive, fatigue, and brain fog symptoms, as well as a significant benefit in brain processing speed, and a trend toward large benefits on anxiety symptoms. No significant change was noted in a measure of global cognition.\" Essentially, \"intensive, repetitive, and progressively challenging activities can drive beneficial changes to the brain.\" However, you do want to be careful with triggering fatigue and post-exertional malaise if you suffer from that, so pacing can be important. Sorry again for making so much reading for you, but I hope this helps. Mask up, eat well, and exercise your brain over time, find a specialist if you can, and things hopefully will get better. I've gotten a lot better with help. Feel free to reply if you have any questions! www.news-medical.net/news/20250505/Breakthrough-brain-training-shows-promise-for-Long-COVID-recovery.aspx reply",

          "text": "You’re definitely not alone “AI code loot box” is a great description! I’ve been experimenting with Claude Code (and the other major models) since late last year, and my success rate seems to track yours unless I’m deliberate about “prompt engineering” and workflow. Here are a few things that have helped me get better, more reliable results: 1. Be uncomfortably explicit in prompts:\nClaude Code in particular is very sensitive to ambiguity. When I write a prompt, I’ll often: Specify coding style, performance constraints, and even “avoid X library” if needed. Give sample input/output (even hand-written). Explicitly state: “Prefer simplicity and readability over cleverness.” 2. Break down problems more than feels necessary:\nIf I give Claude a 5-step plan and ask for code for the whole thing, it often stumbles. But if I ask for one function at a time, or have it generate stub functions first, then fill in each one, the output is much more solid. 3. Always get it to generate unit tests (and run them immediately):\nI now habitually ask:\n\"Write code that does X. Then, write at least 3 edge-case unit tests.\"\nEven if the code needs cleanup, the tests usually expose the gaps. 4. Plan mode can work, but human-tighten the plan first:\nI’ve found Claude’s “plan” sometimes overestimates its own reasoning ability. After it makes a plan, I’ll review and adjust before asking for code generation. Shorter, concrete steps help. 5. Use “summarize” and “explain” after code generation:\nIf I get a weird/hard-to-read output, I’ll paste it back and ask “Explain this block, step by step.” That helps catch misunderstandings early. Re: Parallelization and rate limits:\nI suspect most rate-limit hitters are power-users running multiple agents/tools at once, or scripting API calls. I’m in the same boat as you — the limiting factor is usually review/rework time, not the API. Last tip:\nI keep a running doc of prompts that work well and bad habits to avoid. When I start to see spurious/overly complex output, it’s nearly always because I gave unclear requirements or tried to do too much in one message. reply",

          "text": "I've been without an IT gig for the last year, though it had nothing to do with the overall tech market tightening. Prior to my gig ending, I'd already made the decision to change careers (at least for a while), so I haven't really looked for anything new, I've been focusing on the career change.  At 46, I just wasn't really looking forward to starting to experience the tech ageism; and, the AI craziness is really grating to me.  It's feels like the seagulls from Finding Nemo except instead of \"Mine Mine Mine\" it's \"AI AI AI\".  :-D I'm about two weeks away from leaving for pilot training at a regional airline, so hopefully in a few months I'll be just another cog in a machine for a while, flying people around on jet powered busses.  If the airline life turns out to be my speed for the long haul, then the goal would be to get over to a mainline carrier ASAP; if not, I can always fall back to tech later, and for now I'll enjoy the office view from 34k ft. I'm aware that I've traded upcoming implicit ageism for explicitly regulated ageism, but if I am lucky enough to stay healthy I don't have to worry about that kicking in until I'm 65. reply",

          "text": "I did a chunk of my primary training back when I was 21, but as often happens, I got to around the cross country solo portion and ran out of money and life priorities changed.. unfortunately, I then set it down for a really long time; sort of forgot that I actually really loved it, I guess. Came back to flying in 2019 and finished up my private certificate, with no particular intention other than I wanted to fly because I enjoyed it, and perhaps instruct because I do enjoy teaching.  Went on to get my instrument and commercial, and around the time I got my commercial certificate, I started toying with the idea of pursuing it as a possible career change.  Went on to get my multi-engine add on, which kind of cemented the idea of trying it for a living.  CFI and CFII after that, and between doing some instructing and flying a lot just because I liked flying, I started applying at airlines around December of last year and I crossed the 1500hr mark in March of this year.  Interviewed at my first choice regional in May, they gave me a CJO, and training class date in mid July. Pilot hiring right now is pretty tight, so I've been pretty fortunate to get the regional I wanted right out of the gate, and to not have a long delay for a class date.  As with anything involving timing in life, I definitely timed it wrong -- my earning potential and qualify of life outlook would've been vastly improved if I'd been ready to make this jump 2 to 3 years ago, but what can you do :-D reply",

Reason I say is that as soon as Covid hit, it seems like the triple As just stopped - which makes no sense because all they did was hire.

Which then meant that these things had to be standout hits to be considered successful, which puts more pressure on perfecting everything, which takes more time, ... Then many studios have stories of either deep direction changes or large projects being cancelled as the money wasn't as available anymore and trends shifted. E.g.

Will Wright said that you go from 4 hours of work per hour of meetings to 1 hour of work per 4 hours of meetings. This can be scaled down with wikis and tools. Chinese companies tend to have \"living documentation\" aka system analysts - a person whose job is to understand everything and be asked questions whenever someone gets stuck. Western companies are very resistant to this model for some reason. Bethesda is another way to build things at scale. Lots of isolated sections that don't link into the main thing. But it's hard to build something like Fallout 2 that way when the whole story isn't in one person's head. Part of the reason for so many layoffs recently is because it works.

          "text": "(edit: reading again, this is sort of besides the point of the parent comment, but whatever) I've been wondering about this as well, here are some of my hypotheses... Business related * Covid did it: we are currently experiencing a delayed effect. AAA games take roughly 5 years to develop (I think?), Covid generated a lot of uncertainty and chaos and thus less games got started during this period. Supply chains and finance were in disarray and we didn't know how long the pandemic would last. To make matters worse, this coincided with the release of the new console generation, which is typically a big moment of reorganizing and new ip, so we had a double whammy in that regard. How much new consoles would get sold in this new environment of chip shortages? How long would the shortages last? Is crypto here to stay and will they keep buying up al GPUs? * Lending has gotten more expensive and this is driving up risk perception and lowering profitability. In the aggregate this leads to less games being released. * There's been a lot of mergers between industry behemoths, so internal strategies and reorgs might have something to do with it. There is more vertical integration. There is less competition between AAA publishers because there are simply less of them. * Outsourcing has changed due to internal and geopolitics. Chinese game market development and government restrictions, etc. * There's been a switch to mobile and PC gaming, the home console market has been shrinking in relative terms. * Online game libraries on consoles keep expanding, resulting in lower demand for new games that we saw in previous generations. Game trends related * All AAA devs were making their variation on open world games, but there has been an increasing fatigue with the formula. I see something similar happening roughly once every decade where the AAA industry grapples to find new mechanics and a corresponding production pipeline. Like in the 2000-2010 period games became highly linear because that way you could slice the units of work in time. Then in 2010-2020 people got sick of that and the new production pipeline became one of open world freedom alongside editors and workflows that allowed the entire team to populate a single giant world. Gameplay changed from highly scripted cinematic experiences into 'immersive' gameplay systems. Player now are getting tired of this trend but we haven't figured out a new one yet. Before the 2000s this was less of an issue because dev teams were more nimble, asset creation was less of a bottleneck and technical innovations were a bigger driver in popularity and length of development. * There's been a switch to \"forever\" games in AAA. Where a studio just builds one big game they keep supporting and funneling players into. These are typically multiplayer, but that leads to issues of network effects. There's been a lot of new multiplayer games over the past decade but the player pool hasn't kept the same pace, so only the popular ones and first movers survive. * Indie games glut + higher quality indie 'AA' games causing the AAA sector to having to differentiate themselves more, which they suck at because they're all about return on investment. reply",

I guess the US tech market has been drugged on free cash for too long, to even have an idea of what the real world is. reply",

          "text": "Genuinely curious – what do you think the solution is? Personally I think labels like \"nationalist\" are unhelpful, but regardless what you label it what I do believe is that there needs to be a genuine conversation about whether it's better to have more expensive goods and services if it means people have jobs and opportunities. I'd be fine with iPhones costing 2-3x more if I knew they were built domestically. Those who couldn't afford them could always buy second hand or hold on to them for longer. And historically of course this was often how things worked... People brought quality clothes or quality furniture and looked after them for years – decades even. Whereas today because we can exploit foreigners for super cheap goods we don't really care if we need to buy a new pair of shoes every 6 months – it's created a completely different economic model and one that a skilled worker cannot compete with, at least on price. Perhaps the economy on the whole wouldn't grow as fast if there were more protectionist policies, but at the same time I'd be amazed if it didn't significantly improve job prospects and inequality. That said, we almost everyone in the middle-class deserves to lose their jobs to foreign workers for how awful they've treated those below them for struggling to find good work in the era of globalisation. reply",

We can even have some tariffs if they're well thought out, such as anti-dumping or on certain sectors (Trump 1 and Biden). Protectionism might not be the biggest factor in economic growth. It feels like the tariffs haven't changed much from a personal perspective. Im more concerned about unemployment due to rates and the section 174(?) changes. The tariffs have nothing to do with all the layoffs. It also feels like AI and automation have a lot of companies just waiting to see if they're really need to hire more people if if they can just use AI. Seems like lots of people are filling multiple roles right now. I get that the economy is measured by GDP and we did see it shrink in Q1. However, it doesn't feel like a good measure due to all the inequality. It feels like stuff like credit card balances, mortgage defaults, and unemployment are better numbers. Those don't look good but haven't skyrocketed either... yet. Yeah, the middle class has been shrinking for years. I do think some of the absolutist free trade stances we had played a role. I'm probably going to lose my job soon and if feel like I'll just end up working at Walmart. I've never understood how the candidates that say they're pro labor are also the ones pushing for absolutist free trade and environmental restrictions. Some of these are at odds. If you're free trade, you're just shifting those jobs to the cheaper markets. That's also where the environmental and worker protection seem to be weakest. reply",

          "text": "To learn a folk style you really need a mentor that can connect you to the oral tradition. Rather than scales and technical exercises, focus on learning rhythm and complete pieces. If there is a flamenco dance school in your area, see if they offer guitar lessons and the opportunity to accompany dancers. Always remember: The notes are not necessarily the most important thing. That said, there's a lot of overlap between flamenco and traditional classical guitar, so learning classical pieces (particularly by Spanish composers) will help build your fingerstyle technique. Solo Guitar Playing by Frederick Noad was the book I used for classical practice when I was younger. Also check out pseudo-flamenco pieces that have been recorded by rock and country guitarists, like \"Mood for a Day\" and \"Malagueña\", and smooth flamenco crossover artists like Ottmar Liebert and Jesse Cook. You might find these too diluted from \"real\" flamenco, but they can be another entry point for building up your playing. reply",

It's not that Brian couldn't have done that solo, he's an amazing player and can play in multiple styles, it sounded like from the interview they just wanted to add a different perspective to the track. If you want to listen to something I think very few people in the pop scene could replicate I would suggest listening to Paco De Lucia. Of course people like Al Di Meola who played with Paco were able to crossover into that world but he is a virtuoso in his own right. reply",

I've known the stakes since before AI existed, and the prominence of LLMs doesn't scare me away from open source. It's up to you. Stallman argued that the greatest value code has is it's utility to others. The \"holy grail endgame\" of open source is zero-margin software production that completely displaces the need to generate value with software. If AI pushes us closer to that world, then I can sleep well feeding it code. reply",

          "text": "Yes, the company I work for has started using Hololens 2. We have a program that can overlay the 3D models from our CAD program onto the physical steel assemblies for QC. When it works, it works well and enables our quality checkers to perform checks faster and more accurately than using tape measures while going back and forth looking at a 2D drawing printed on 11 x 17 paper. The biggest hurdles is that none of the large companies think there is enough profit to be made from AR. The Hololens 2 is the only headset on the market both capable of running the program required while also being safe to use in a active shop enviroment (VR with passthrough is not suitable). Unfortunately the Hololens 2 is almost 6 years old as is being stretched to the absolute limits of its hardware capabilities. The technology is good but feels like it is only 90% of the way to where it needs to be. Even a simple revision with double the RAM and faster more power efficient processor would alleviate many of the issues we've experienced. Ultimately from what I've seen, AR is about making the human user better at their job and there are tons of industries where it could have many applications, but tech companies don't actually want to make things that could be directly useful to people that work with their hands, so instead we will just continue to toss more money at AI hoping to make ourselves obsolete. reply",

          "text": "The biggest issue comes from area mapping. In order to keep the hologram steady and anchored you need to perform a mapping process so that the helmet recognizes both the physical steel assembly and a bit of the surrounding area to keep it steady when moving around. The 8GB of RAM puts a limit on the amount of mapping data that can be stored putting a limit of the size of assembly you can work with, and since the mapping process relies on using the helmets own software that has not been work on in years it is extremely sensitive to any sort of background movement, which means it works best in as controlled of a environment as possible. Right now we are just using it for special projects that are complex and have little margin for error. We'd like to be able to use it for everything but that isn't feasible with where the tech is currently stuck at. reply",

A heads up display is just looking at the blueprint on a piece of paper with an additional layer of complexity, it wouldn't remove the need to manually measure, nor would it provide any assistance in spotting missing attached pieces (or some extra pieces). Once the model is overlayed QC goes from having to measure the placement of every pieces and the location of every hole to just walking around the finished assembly and ensuring that every conforms to the civil engineer approved model. A half hour process can be done faster and more precisely in 5 minutes, you notices very quickly when there is solid steel where the hologram has a hole, or thin air where the hologram shows that a plate was suppose to be welded on. reply",

          "text": "We work with all of the large general contractors in the steel construction industry. Right now, it's turned into one contract, but we are the second company the client has employed since the first company they hired failed to produce a single assembly that met their requirements. The client was the one that originally was using this tech since they wanted a way to do their own QC after the first experience, and we decided it was worth while pursuing ourselves since successfully pulling this project off while be a HUGE boost to our reputation. The construction industry is all about your portfolio of past projects. QA is the big sales point of the software we are using, but there are many other  potential applications for the same product. It should be possible to overlay the model on the main assembly prefab then use that to quickly mark where holes should be drilled and additional pieces attached. The other potential application that is being explored is using the holographic overlays to construct things out of the usual order, instead of building part 1 then starting part 2 since it needs to be built to conform to the first part you can instead build around the hologram so that your not relying on the previously built parts to ensure your angles are correct. I agree about the chicken/egg problem. Its an emerging technology where the payoff might be a decade away, customers need software that will actually benefit them, developers need reliable hardware capable of running software that has practical uses, and hardware companies want to know there is a customer base. The issue is AR falls under the category of product that the customer does not know they actually want, so the only way it is going to be developed is if one of the hardware manufactures takes a leap of faith and makes the long term investment. Sadly, I feel like AR is a million dollar idea with practical uses that has to contend with a business climate where you can make billions making some doodad that collects private data then displays ads to the masses. reply",

          "text": "I've gone down this rabbit hole with customers as a PM still working in the space. Here is what I've learned. The past decade of devices (hololens, realwear, google glass, vuzix, etc) were some combination of way too heavy, expensive, fragile, short battery life, no wifi connectivity, too much UI long to get to point of value and/or simply not useful. That and most customers had a content problem. The AR/VR use in the field typically came down to looking something up in a manual or calling someone. Both easily and perhaps more effectively done on a smartphone. There was an instance where I asked techs why they weren't using the headset for showing what they were seeing in realtime and they said, it's easier to facetime (hard to argue that). The cool AR 3-D demos or overlays rarely worked in the field on real equip or didn't actually convey anything useful (everyone knows the basics of how the machine works). There are training VR use cases (like learning to operate a crane), but once again it's a nice to have supplement and not a replacement. Recent advances with LLMs (specifically voice) + Meta type \"glasses form factor\" have created intrigue again with innovation centers at large companies. The use case we're currently working on is inspections or filling out forms with audio/videos. reply",

I've also been watching the field for a while, have done some contracting for others trying to make their own AR devices, and tipped my toes in the water making some basic prototypes myself. >some combination of way too heavy, expensive, fragile, short battery life, no wifi connectivity, too much UI long to get to point of value and/or simply not useful Was the screen quality, resolution, visibility in brightness, etc also one of these limiting factors? Or would you say screen quality has gotten reasonable by now? >The AR/VR use in the field typically came down to looking something up in a manual or calling someone. That's good to hear as someone interested in the field, I've been skeptical of the fidelity and utility of the fancy augmented 3D overlays. Ah I see you realized something similar:\n>The cool AR 3-D demos or overlays rarely worked in the field on real equip or didn't actually convey anything useful (everyone knows the basics of how the machine works). >Both easily and perhaps more effectively done on a smartphone. Surely there are some use cases where hands-free operation would be a game changer, but I don't know enough about potential industries where this would be the case. >The use case we're currently working on is inspections or filling out forms with audio/videos. That's pretty interesting, do you even need a screen, or just voice? I would think a pretty quick-and-dirty way to do it is to take pdf forms, enumerate (put small numbers) next to every editable field, and then use voice commands like, \"write the following in field 3: ....\" The purpose of having a screen would be to verify what the LLM + voice is inputting in the form.

          "text": "For me the Vision Pro is my main machine now (supported by a MacBook Pro). And I absolutely love it. Which is saying something. My second most ergonomic situation is a 120\" screen with two 55\" screens tilting in from both sides (both in portrait, so all 3 screen verticals line up). All wall mounted. I started wall mounting to get screens off my desk, at which point it was clear bigger was always better. But for the Vision it took many rounds of trying third party head gear, and customization, before I could wear it comfortably for unlimited time. I just kept trying things until I got there. I am an obsessive optimist when it comes to ergonomics. Once the Vision is ergonomic for one's head, then it becomes a super ergonomic solution over all. The screen can be wherever you need it for best neck, back and body posture, whether at a desk, couch, (non-driving) car seat, or in bed. And a very wide screen beats any screen patchwork. Although I would like the Vision even more if I could have more than one Mac driven screen when I wanted to. (Recommend expansion batteries that clip on the original, and round magnetic USB-C cable adapters, for more spontaneous mobility.) I like the standard Apple straps in a pinch. But my face needs a serious break from the weight they distribute on it, every 30-120 minutes. reply",

We post case studies regularly on our blog, so you can read about real world deployments there: blog.resolvebim.com From my experience the hardware is still a hurdle simply because it doesn’t completely replace all pc based workflows right now and therefore has to be used selectively at the right moments alongside 2D monitors. reply",

From your company's landing page, I saw the video and it looks like you're working with in-office project managers and similar white-collar types. Do you work with any products in the field, like on the job sites? Is that something that would be interesting or valuable? Some examples: letting workers be able to quickly share first-person recorded videos of issues, first-person video chat with supervisors, ability to pull up blueprints and instructions in their heads-up displays, etc? Assuming perhaps a different platform than the Meta, as I don't think fully covered VR would be appropriate for a worksite. reply",

You can see in that video that you can markup the site virtually and yes you can record video, leave issue markers, pull up 2D plans from other tools we integrate with like Procore, ACC, etc. However, it still is primarily a stationary tool on site because of the field of view limitations.

The increased focal distance seems to help, but the nose piece is weirdly designed and the pressure under the pads becomes a little painful after an hour or two. Also the field of view is too wide and so the edges are blurry (hard to see clock, corner buttons in fullscreen windows, health bar in video games, etc). Worked great to avoid eye fatigue/posture issues on airplanes though. I'm happy I have them, but in hindsight I'd have gotten a Viture or something with a better nose bridge and a narrower field of view. reply",

Pleasantly surprised how usable it is for 3-6 hour stretches, more productive than just a laptop screen alone. At home I'll likely return to physical monitors though. Tips: Get an upgraded headband, silicone face cover and carrying case. Use a physical USB connection for lower latency (& turn off the wifi/bluetooth as it's no longer needed). Bring a cloth for keeping the lenses clean. Bump the Retina quality up in the Immersed client (on Mac). Lower resolutions (1920x1080) are more comfortable to use over longer periods. Use a travel neck pillow for reclined usage. Bring replacement batteries and a charger for the controllers. reply",

You can put a ton of weight on your head with perfect comfort as long as it's balanced properly. The AVP's real problem is that its ergonomics are just shit. As with a bunch of other things, they designed for the ads instead of actual usability, so it's significantly worse than headsets that are actually much heavier, and the earband design with the way-too-far-back connectors and no top connections makes it nigh impossible for third parties to improve on it.

I think the key issue is whether or not it adds enough value to justify buying everybody a headset, and for our use case I don't know if it does, though I'm just a lowly programmer, I don't know what the customers think about it. We have another product that's geared towards collaborating and sharing data between teams and vendors, and it seems better suited there, but that one is a web application, and I don't know how well VR glasses are supported there.

First responders and retailers have some of the largest internal deployments out there, but they aren’t massively publicized (most people would never guess who’s fielding the largest fleet of headsets right now). That said, it’s still not mass adoption. At the end of the day, you are asking someone to put something on their face that is still very different ergonomically than glasses (and I’m not sure even glasses would overcome enough friction). The ROI has to overcome the business (or personal) friction of buying the hardware, the friction of the form factor plus any friction from changed workflows. Now put that in an operational workflow instead of training and the risks go up. Most are still skeptical of device reliability (not to say there aren’t suitable devices for operational roles but the perception is still a hurdle, and the applicability is often device-specific). Now add on to that limited experience with devices (many decision makers have never put one on), added security complications, specialized software development skills, limited content libraries and very real accessibility concerns and a lot of enterprises can never get past an “innovation center demo.” For many industries the value proposition just isn’t there yet. But that said, I’d recommend digging a little deeper as there’s a lot of existing use-cases and deployments, both failed and successful, outside of IVAS. reply",

          "text": "Hello! I spent a lot of time in graduate school researching AR/VR technology (specifically regarding its utility as an accessibility tool) and learning about barriers to adoption. In my opinion, there are three major hurdles preventing widespread adoption of this modality: 1. *Weight*: To achieve powerful computation like that of the HoloLens, you need powerful processing. The simplest solution to this is to put the processing in the device, which adds weight to it. The HoloLens 2 weighs approximately 566g (or 1.24lb), which is a LOT of weight compared to a pair of traditional glasses, which weigh approximately 20-50g. Speaking as someone who developed with the HL2 for a few years, all-day wear with the device is uncomfortable and untenable. The weight of the device HAS to be comfortable for all-day use, otherwise it hinders adoption. 2. *Battery*: Ironically, making the device smaller to accommodate all-day wear means that you're simultaneously reducing its battery life, which reduces its utility as an all-day wearable: any onboard battery must be smaller, and thus store less energy. This is a problematic trade-off: you don't want the device to weigh too much that people can't wear it, but you also don't want the device to weigh too little that it ceases to have function. 3. *Social Acceptability*: This is where I have some expertise, as it was the subject of my research. Simply put, if a wearer feels as though they stand out by wearing an XR device, they're hesitant to wear it at all when interacting with others. This means that an XR device must not be ostentatious, as the Apple Vision Pro, HoloLens, MagicLeap, and Google Glass all were. In recent years, there have been a lot of strides in this space, but there's a long way to go. Firstly, there is increasingly an understanding that the futuristic devices we see in sci-fi cannot be achieved with onboard computation (yet). That said, local, bidirectional, wireless streaming between a lightweight XR device (glasses) and a device with stronger processing power (a la smartphone) provides a potential weigh of offloading computation from the device itself, and simply displaying results onboard. Secondly, Li+ battery tech continues to improve, and there are now [simple head-worn displays capable of rendering text and bitmaps]( https://www.vuzix.com/products/z100-smart-glasses ) with a battery life of an entire day. There is also active development work by the folks at [Mentra (YC W25)]( https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/mentra ) on highlighting these devices' utility, even with their limited processing power. Lastly, with the first two developments combined, social acceptability is improving dramatically! There are lots of new head-worn displays emerging with varying levels of ability. There was the recent [Android XR keynote]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nv1snJRCEI ), which shows some impressive spatial awareness, as well as the [Mentra Live]( https://mentra.glass/pages/live ) (an open-source Meta Raybans clone). In terms of limited displays with social acceptability, there are the [Vuzix Z100]( https://www.vuzix.com/products/z100-smart-glasses ), and [Even Realities G1]( https://www.evenrealities.com/g1 ), which can display basic information (that still has a lot of utility!). As an owner of the Vuzix Z100 and a former developer in the XR space, the progress is slow, but steady. The rapid improvements in machine learning (specifically in STT, TTS, and image understanding) indirectly improve the AR space as well. reply",

          "text": "We’ve developed VR based industrial safety training, as a self-contained, portable product for blue collar workers in India - launched about 24 months ago with regular updates. Multiple companies have bought it, and we have large companies as clients who’ve used it to train 1000s of their blue-collar workers, even in sectors such as construction in a relatively challenging (in terms of pricing and value) market. We have a significant (I think!) number of devices deployed, and most of my clients end up purchasing more after the initial purchase and pilot. I think that’s for a few reasons: 1) VR, when well designed, can offer 1st person experience of being an accident victim due to the viewer’s own oversight / someone else’s oversight. That makes it a far more effective way to draw the learner’s attention to the importance of the safety protocols, etc. 2) Our solution is multi-lingual: it’s currently available in 10 regional Indian languages - that matters, since a significant fraction of the workforce may not understand English. Our localisation extends beyond that, but language is a big thing in enabling access and usage. 3) if you have to invest 10-15 min per learner (often one-on-one as the instructor) to onboard each learner before they can use your solution, it becomes very difficult to scale and raises the bar for cost-effectiveness. So that’s something we focus on heavily. 4) Setup time- don’t create a solution that requires IT support, someone who understands how to setup / load SteamVR / Oculus Link / meta Horizon. If the solution adds 20-30 min workload to the staff on a site, then adopting it becomes that much more painful - so we’ve worked very hard to develop an integrated system where the instructor can quickly onboard 10-15 learners and get going with the session in 5 min. 5) workflow changes: often, introducing VR means changing some part of the organisation’s workflow - many VR solutions don’t consider this / acknowledge this in their design- clients get initially excited, but when it comes to actually using it on a daily basis, the deployment and workflow frictions can completely tank VR adoption. I’ve seen multiple solutions fail because of this, and we focus extensively on this when we design our solutions. India is a hard market for VR, honestly because it’s very price sensitive. But I think we’ve made some progress here, because we’ve focused extensively on system robustness, ease of deployment, localization, and a lot of user-centered design. We’ve also developed sophisticated VR - based training solutions for SOP training. VR can be / is, very effective for initial onboarding and SOP training. Again, the challenge here is usability - most of the learner’s don’t know how to use the controllers. Learning how to use the controllers is not easy and takes time. So that onboarding is critical and needs to be done well. In SOP training, our experience is that it can, if designed well, significantly reduce on-boarding time; however, you still need the last 20% of training on the actual thing for it to stick, and for the learner to actually _learn_.

          "text": "AR is much harder as a solution to deploy at scale, I think. First off, most solutions work poorly out in day light - especially the bright Indian sun. So that automatically adds friction in terms of deployment opportunities / field deployment. The second issue is the limited FoV: 40-45 degrees. That's a pretty small display area to play with in terms of pushing detailed information, etc. Third, again, the usability, ruggedness and user-onboarding challenges. So, the use case has to be important enough and significant enough that the user / organization needs to accept all these frictions and still derive enough value out of the solution - that leaves very few use cases. Add to that, HoloLens is expensive, hasn’t seen any significant development in the past few years, and real wear type devices too aren’t cheap for large scale adoption - a smartphone / tablet in hand is often a better / more maintainable / cost effective solution even compared to real wear - I’ve seen clients securely mount a smartphone on their helmet and setup a teams call for remote viewing - it works! reply",

Or being especially good at math, or science, or computers, seemingly without much effort. Music is (for most people) not like that.  For getting proficient at instrumental music, the skill floor is high, progress is slow, and only comes through hard boring work which rewires your brain.  Teachers tell you to do boring things, and say things that don't make sense, and you will be frustrated.  Eventually you realize that you can do things you couldn't do before. There are whiz kids who don't appear to experience this, but I think they do; they are just wired to not hate it as much as the rest of us, and are doing it when their brains are nicely plastic. When I say \"getting proficient at instrumental music\" I mean to differentiate from learning how to play Wonderwall or Louie Louie and having a great time singing along.  That's absolutely valid, it's a great place to be, and that love of the instrument forms the basis of further progress. reply",

          "text": "Flamenco can be a very challenging and technical style, but it doesn't have to be. I don't know your background, but if you just want to have fun and sound good quickly, try this. Get a nylon string guitar. It doesn't have to be a flamenco guitar per-se, any classical will do. But steel string acoustic guitars will absolutely not work for this style. The sound is wrong and the strings are too close together. Learn the Andalusian cadence. It's the chords A minor, G, F, and E, in that order. This is the characteristic \"Spanish\" sound recognisable by everyone, and is in fact a fundamental building block of Flamenco style (por arriba). The chords can be played barred or open, your choice. You can instead start in D minor (por medio) if you like. Practice a basic rumba strumming pattern until it is drilled into your muscle memory. The easiest is to just strum, counting from 1 to 8, and on beat 5 slap the strings instead of strumming. Do not use a pick. There are several right-hand techniques you'll want to learn. The most important is probably rasgueado (\"gypsy strumming\"). You essentially flick your fingers so that each one strums the strings in rapid succession. It's challenging at first, but try to make the timing in between fingers roughly even. Next is tremolo: rapidly plucking the same string with alternating fingers, while playing bass notes with your thumb. This is a common classical guitar technique too, but Flamenco takes it further, often using 4 plucks instead of 3. Actually flamenco technique breaks many classical guitar \"rules\". Once you want to start mastering more specific styles (\"palos\"), just get some tabs and work through them. You'll probably want to start with soleares, alegrias, farruca, fandango. Unlike classical guitar, nobody will look down at you for using tabs (or learning by ear) instead of notation. Paco de Lucia famously does not read notation. Hope this helps. Have fun! reply",

          "text": "To learn a folk style you really need a mentor that can connect you to the oral tradition. Rather than scales and technical exercises, focus on learning rhythm and complete pieces. If there is a flamenco dance school in your area, see if they offer guitar lessons and the opportunity to accompany dancers. Always remember: The notes are not necessarily the most important thing. That said, there's a lot of overlap between flamenco and traditional classical guitar, so learning classical pieces (particularly by Spanish composers) will help build your fingerstyle technique. Solo Guitar Playing by Frederick Noad was the book I used for classical practice when I was younger. Also check out pseudo-flamenco pieces that have been recorded by rock and country guitarists, like \"Mood for a Day\" and \"Malagueña\", and smooth flamenco crossover artists like Ottmar Liebert and Jesse Cook. You might find these too diluted from \"real\" flamenco, but they can be another entry point for building up your playing. reply",

          "text": "As someone who plays flamenco, it starts with finger style. Playing with your hand NOT resting on the strings or body, using TPIMRp (little p is pinky), master playing patterns. Travis picking is popular. Boogie woogie is too where you play three notes together with PIM and playing the bass line with T. A pinching pattern or claw hammer is another method. Once you’ve mastered (I mean, can play Eric Clapton and Co) it then take it into the minor keys and learn the directional flamenco picking. Where you flick RMI downwards striking your fingernails, following it with your T in a downward pluck, then pulling IMR upwards. Some people reverse this but it’s always the same when it’s repeated. Eventually you’ll be able to picado like a pro. Malagueña watch out. Your finger nails are now important. Learn about shaping them with a filer or getting gel tips. Your girlfriend can help in this department. As others have said, there’s no short cut, only practice and patience. Eventually it will click. *EDIT* https://youtube.com/shorts/IfOFLtf0h8c Paco De Lucia is a great one to study. reply",

          "text": "I'll give my 2 cents as someone that picked up guitar playing about 10 years ago. I don't play flamenco but I'm familiar with some of the techniques. I would suggest: - Get a guitar that you think you will like picking up and playing. Whether it's electric, steel string acoustic, classical, or flamenco. Whatever rocks your boat and you like the sound. Have it somewhere where you can just grab it and play a little when you feel like it. - Learn the basic open chord shapes and some simple songs. Don't worry about flamenco technique for starters. - Once you have some very basic control of the instrument and you know a few shapes and forms (e.g. 3-6 months) you can pick up some easy tutorials of basic flamenco chord progressions and try those out. You don't need a ton of fancy chords or technique to get some flamenco like sounds out of your instrument. - You will need to build what people call \"facility\". This is your ability to move your fingers quickly, put them in the right places, etc. this needs to happen with a combination of drilling and playing progressively harder pieces. I would still say you don't have to aim for super complicated flamenco techniques yet but you can learn something about spanish scales and chord progressions and start experimenting. - Learning some simple fingerstyle songs/patterns will likely help if you do decide to specialize more in flamenco. - A teacher will certainly help and may be necessary at some point. Probably a good idea to take some lessons early on just to get corrected on basic mistakes. Then you can go back to playing/practicing on your own and come back again when you feel you need more help. - A book is really hard to learn from when you don't know anything. Videos are better. But you will need feedback from a person at some point. - Record yourself playing. Challenge yourself to learn progressively harder pieces (in whatever style). - Practice with a metronome to improve your sense of time. - You will need to learn some theory, scales etc. - You also need to develop your ear. Listen to music and try to figure out notes/chords etc. Sing a tune and try to play it by ear. It's a journey but it's easy to get to a point where you can play some simple songs and have fun and build from there. reply",

          "text": "Back when I learned guitar,  guitar players came in only two flavors -- Spanish and Hawaiian.  One was a Spanish guitarist if one played the guitar with the face of the guitar vertical (strings forming roughly a vertical plane),  and a Hawaiian guitarist if the guitar was oriented horizontally,  typically in the lap of the guitarist, with each forearm also approximately parallel to the face of the guitar pointing forward from the guitarist.  Nowadays genres are all mostly obscurely defined, fragmented, swirling around, and trying to become world music, which is wonderful,  and almost everyone is trying to be one of a kind,  so good luck figuring that all out and finding a happy place in it. Don't be like me; if you are not in the water you are not learning to swim -- just play! reply",

          "text": "> Yeah, no one wants some abandoned open source project for a defunct business. That's not true. The OP mentions there are current users. Some of the current customers might be able to use ANY distribution to patch problems for a while. Eventually, someone mightneed to decide on serious maintenance or not. But initially it quite possibly would not require much. When there are current users, the future may not be a thriving project but may be simply a patched up current solution. Nothing wrong with that. I suspect this is the case pretty often: a current solution is not great but it's in place. The code itself is nothing to write home about, but it's in place. Patching problems in the code might be the easier path for the user. reply",

We've seen from \"AI plays games\" efforts that there have been some pretty spectacular failures.   It seems like \"use app\" is a different problem. reply",

Though Apple's lack of native 3rd party search engine support has been annoying, and it requires various hacks from Kagi to make it work. That's my only gripe, but that's on Apple. The hardest things for me have been email and maps. The switching cost for email, especially one I've had since the gmail beta, is astronomically high. I don't think I will ever be able to fully delete the account (though I did delete about 5 alt email accounts I had with Gmail). Maps has also been hard, as Google Maps is my go-to place for business information and reviews. I use Apple Maps for actual navigation, but their POI and business data is severely lacking, and the lean on Yelp doesn't cut it. Kagi maps is being developed, but has a long way to go, and to get to the point of Google Maps... I don't think they have keep enough pockets for that. And there is YouTube of course, which is Google owned. There is really no good alternative for that. reply",

We tested out proton’s ‘business suite’, and it just doesn’t come close. Proton Pass is nice, but the ‘drive’ feature doesn’t have anything remotely close to what the Google Drive / Docs / Sheets / Slides ecosystem has. It also seems relatively new, so we’ll revisit it in a few months hopefully. We also tested out Microsoft teams, and no, just no. It’s just really convenient to onboard employees and the browser management with chrome is ultimately the deciding factor, as well as not having to worry about email deliverability. I feel like there is a somewhat big market for someone who wants to take on the Google workspace / MS teams products. For the most part, I feel like this wouldn’t be difficult to build besides the email deliverability part being most crucial. Along with forking chromium or Firefox and reimplementing the browser management system, which also can maybe be done with an extension. reply",

Instead consider: * the number of total sockets as I suspect there could be multiple sockets per user. * investigate what socket.io does to serialize messages both on and off the wire. I wrote my own WebSocket library for Node and noticed the cost to process messages on the receiving end is about 11x greater than on the sending end. Normally that doesn’t matter until you push it past a critical point. At the critical point everything begins to super crawl because the message quantity per interval exceeds the garbage collection cycle and everything backs up. In my case this scenario didn’t realize until 180000 or 480000 messages per second depending upon the hardware. The critical difference from the hardware side was only about memory speed and cpu availability was largely irrelevant. * also look at what socket.io does, if at all, to queue messages at each side of the socket. Message queued both on and off the wire will be a factor if not properly managed or if absent reply",

Ideally, your service processes are waiting on i/o (epoll, select, kqread, etc) or you're CPU limited. Is there any cross-room communication? Can you spawn a process per room? Scaling limited at 25% CPU on a 4 vcpu node strongly suggests a locked section limiting you to effectively single threaded performance. Multiple processes serving rooms should bypass that if you can't find it otherwise, but maybe there's something wrong in your load balancing etc. Personally, I'd rather run with fewer layers, because then you don't have to debug the layers when you have perf issues. Do matchmaking wherever with whatever layers, and let your room servers run in the host os, no containers. But nobody likes my ideas. :P Edit to add: your network load is tiny. This is almost certainly something with your software, or how you've setup your layers. Unless those vCPUs are ancient , you should be able to push a whole lot more packets. reply",

          "text": "So when running `top` WCHAN shows `ep_poll` most of the time and sometimes `-`. Even when the game starts lagging this pattern stays pretty consistent. There is no cross-room communication. I could spawn a process per room but I was trying to address this issue with my current Docker setup where I have multiple `game` containers that run a single node.js process and each process can host multiple rooms. Not having to use Docker sounds simpler but it's that's where I'm at atm haha. I agree that the network load feels very small. Maybe it's a socket.io related issue where when many broadcasts are being fired at once, then a shared I/O step gets bottlenecked? Here's my actual typing broadcast code, I was originally broadcasting from the socket event callback itself but I found performance improved slightly by batching broadcasts per player in a setInterval loop (also note that only 1 player in a given room can be typing at once, so batching broadcasts per room shouldn't address the bottleneck). /**\n   * Used to handle very frequent typing events more gracefully to avoid overloading CPU\n   */\n  const TypingUsersMap = new Map<\n    ConnectionId,\n    {\n      socketId: string | null; // doesn't exist for bots\n      roomId: PublicRoomId;\n      userId: UserId;\n      currentInput: string;\n    }\n  >();\n\n  type ConnectionId = `${UserId}:${PublicRoomId}`;\n\n  // ! this should be same as client throttle interval\n  const TYPING_BROADCAST_INTERVAL = 200;\n\n  export let typingBroadcastInterval: NodeJS.Timeout | undefined = undefined;\n  export const startTypingBroadcastJob = () => {\n    typingBroadcastInterval = setInterval(() => {\n      const freshTypingUsersMap = new Map(TypingUsersMap);\n      TypingUsersMap.clear();\n\n      if (freshTypingUsersMap.size === 0) return; // Nothing to do\n\n      // Go through each user that has a pending update\n      for (const [_connectionId, data] of freshTypingUsersMap.entries()) {\n        const socket = data.socketId\n          ? io.sockets.sockets.get(data.socketId)\n          : undefined;\n\n        // Use the data we stored to perform the broadcast\n        if (socket) {\n          // emit to other players\n          socket\n            .to(data.roomId)\n            .volatile.emit(\n              SOCKET_EVENT_NAMES.USER_TYPING_RES,\n              data.userId,\n              data.currentInput\n            );\n        } else {\n          // bots emit to everyone\n          io.to(data.roomId).volatile.emit(\n            SOCKET_EVENT_NAMES.USER_TYPING_RES,\n            data.userId,\n            data.currentInput\n          );\n        }\n      }\n    }, TYPING_BROADCAST_INTERVAL);\n  };\n\n  export const stopTypingBroadcastJob = () => {\n    if (typingBroadcastInterval) {\n      clearInterval(typingBroadcastInterval);\n      typingBroadcastInterval = undefined;\n    }\n  };\n\n  // this is called from the USER_TYPING socket event callback. so effectively every throttled keystroke by the user gets queued.\n  export const queueTypingEvent = ({\n    socketId,\n    roomId,\n    userId,\n    currentInput,\n  }: {\n    socketId: string | null;\n    roomId: PublicRoomId;\n    userId: UserId;\n    currentInput: string;\n  }) => {\n    const connectionId: ConnectionId = `${userId}:${roomId}`;\n    TypingUsersMap.set(connectionId, {\n      socketId,\n      roomId,\n      userId,\n      currentInput,\n    });\n  }; reply",

They were selling at a discount to break even, the government was indeed talking about opening borders (we were already inside Thailand at that time, not buying from abroad). We visited the construction site and saw ~10 workers, everything seemed real, like a thing slowly getting back to normal. I have all the reasons to believe now, that these \"workers\" were just paid to be here. The company was advertising, getting batches of potential investors, and making a \"Potemkin\" construction site. They never had any intention of ever finishing the project. reply",

I’d also write one or more long-form articles on a dedicated website—PDFs, images, all the evidence laid out clearly so there’s no doubt it’s real. I’d include a contact phone number and email too. Then I’d buy some backlinks and make it SEO-friendly so it ranks well on Google. I’d set up a Facebook page, post updates regularly, and drive people to both the site and the YouTube channel. I’d run Facebook ads for months—whatever I could afford, ideally at least $2k, but the more, the better. I’d reply to every comment and encourage people to share and speak up. Once that’s all set up, I’d reach out to media outlets—ask them directly how much it costs to feature my site in their digital editions, and from there, figure out what it takes to get something printed in physical form. Depending on how things go after the first month, I’d even consider renting 1 or 2 billboards. reply",

          "text": "Exposing a scam involving a powerful figure is a serious and potentially risky task that must be approached with caution, integrity, and strong evidence. Here’s how one might responsibly and safely proceed: 1. Gather Verifiable Evidence\nCollect documented proof: emails, financial records, contracts, messages, or recordings. Ensure the evidence is authentic, legal to possess, and can withstand scrutiny. 2. Protect Yourself First\nUse secure communication tools (like Signal, ProtonMail, or Tails OS). Anonymize your identity if necessary using VPNs or the Tor network. Consult a lawyer, digital security expert, or whistleblower organization to assess risks. 3. Approach Reputable Investigative Journalists\nTrusted outlets (like The Guardian, ProPublica, or The Intercept) often have secure channels for tips. Choose those with a track record of handling sensitive leaks. 4. Consider Legal Avenues\nFile a report with relevant authorities or anti-corruption bodies (if they are independent and trustworthy). Whistleblower protection laws may apply in some jurisdictions—understand your rights. 5. Avoid Public Accusations Without Proof\nPublicly accusing someone powerful without solid evidence can backfire legally and personally. Focus on exposing facts, not opinions or personal attacks.

          "text": "I'm truly sorry to hear what happened to your mother — she deserved peace, not deception. The scope and international nature of this scam is staggering, and it's commendable that you're trying to fight back. You're not just seeking justice for your mother but potentially protecting future victims. Here are some ideas to help you move forward, both tactically and ethically: 1. Taking the Battle Online – Strategies for Exposure\nHere are a few creative yet responsible ways you could expose the scam: Documentation Website (OSINT + Testimonies)\nCreate a well-structured website (e.g., thailandpropertyscam.org) that: Publishes redacted documents, contracts, and communications. Shares stories from multiple victims (anonymized if necessary). Maps out relationships (via OSINT) between shell companies and individuals. Is translated into several languages to target global victims/investors. Make sure it's SEO-optimized with the scammer’s real name, aliases, company names, and keywords like “Thailand property scam,” “[Company Name] reviews,” etc. Coordinate with Other Victims\nTry to organize victims using a private group (Telegram, Signal, or ProtonMail-based email list). With their consent, a class-action type of presence (even informal) gives more weight. Strategic Disruption\nYour idea of having fake investors back out after referencing your exposé can work as “reputational attrition.” But be cautious: don't fabricate anything — just share documented truth. Plant seeds of doubt with facts. Leverage Reddit, YouTube, and TikTok\nPlatforms like: r/scams, r/Thailand, r/ExpatFIRE, r/RealEstate — have active communities. A well-produced YouTube video titled “My Mom Got Scammed by a Politician’s Daughter in Thailand” could go viral. TikTok/Instagram Reels — emotional 30-60 second clips reach wide audiences. Also post on forums like Expat.com and local-language equivalents in countries of other victims. 2. Finding Journalists / Influencers / Whistleblower Networks\nA few avenues to explore: Journalist Networks\nForbidden Stories OCCRP ICIJ — reach out with your evidence. Bellingcat — they may be interested in OSINT-related scams. Freelance Investigative Journalists\nPost on: JournoRequests (via Twitter/X) Help a Reporter Out (HARO) Indie outlets like Rest of World, Vice World News, and even Asia Sentinel. Local Influencers and Advocates\nThai anti-corruption activists (check Twitter and Facebook). YouTubers or bloggers in the expat/real estate space. Retired expats in Thailand often blog about scams — look for bloggers on TeakDoor.com or ThaiVisaForum.com. A Note on Safety & Censorship\nThailand has extremely strict defamation and lèse-majesté laws. Be extremely careful if you host or write anything from within Thailand or use your name. Use offshore hosting, anonymous WHOIS, VPNs, and consider using services like GlobaLeaks to share information safely. You may even consider getting legal advice from digital rights orgs like: Electronic Frontier Foundation Privacy International Final Thought\nYou’re doing something brave and important. While you may not win legally in Thailand, the internet can be a powerful equalizer. Done ethically and transparently, your efforts can protect others and bring some justice to light. If you do create a site or content, I’m sure many here (myself included) would be willing to help share or amplify it. Stay safe and good luck. reply",

          "text": "Try this: never read without a pencil in your hand. Make it a point to not only orally or mentally restate but also rewrite by hand everything you read (on-screen and in real life) in your own words, and to make multiple drafts of each restatement until it is as succinct, orderly, and logical as possible. This practice will probably help you: * recognize and stop reading low-value material; * read less on your phone; * deeply understand what you're reading; * identify errors in what you're reading; * identify errors in your own understanding; * improve your own writing (and possibly your handwriting!); * recall what you've read and what it says and means; and * build a record of your reading, reactions, and thinking. And, of course, I think it should improve your ability to focus. You can also make flashcards while you're at it (again, handwritten ones) and develop a spaced-repetition practice for the important information and skills. --- Later Edit --- You mention long-form text in particular. One of the most effective tactics to use while reading is to discern the writing's architecture/structure — at all levels, from the writing's genre, to its main components and their arrangement, to how each main part is composed, and so on. Doing so not only helps to understand and critique the author's ideas, but also becomes a fun game that keeps your attention directed. And also keep in mind that > 99% of all writing is not only not great but also probably not worth reading in the first place. It's ok to use boredom as a guide: your mind may be indicating through boredom and distraction that what you're reading isn't worth the time and effort and attention it takes to do so. But if you have decided that you must read something, or that you want to read it and understand it, then I've found that there's no substitute for the handwriting technique.

          "text": "Well, physicality is part of the point: it slows the writer down and provides more engagement with text (with the text being read; and the text representing the reader's ideas about the text being read; and the text representing the reader's ideas about text representing the reader's (prior) ideas about the text being read). Furthermore, handling, pushing around, and organizing actual paper on an actual desktop has (in my experience) effects on the mind that are both different in kind and superior in degree to those achieved by merely thinking, speaking, or typing about something. The availability and simplicity are part of the point too: pencils and paper are ubiquitous; and easily found and inexpensively purchased if not immediately available. Written jots and drafts of ideas, summaries, and reactions (of the kind we're talking about here) are easy and quick to make; they readily reveal their content; and they're easy and quick to view simultaneously, to rearrange, to stack, reorder, organize, store, and share. Compare voice recorders: the devices are not ubiquitous and are costly; they break and are costly to repair or replace; they have many dependencies (batteries/charging/charging plugs; switches prone to failure; firmware; drivers; USB plugs or adapters that can become missing, damaged, or obsolete themselves); etc. And compare the audio tapes or audio files: they don't really and fully reveal their content by glancing at them; they're hard to keep track of; and they're more difficult to change or reorganize. All that said, I think voice recorders have a place and I use a dictaphone myself on occasion — but primarily to spit out several ideas quickly when time is of the essence, I'm afraid I'll lose the thoughts, or I can't find the words to describe them in writing but somehow can blab about the gist of them to create a sort of bookmark for later processing. But then I have to remember to check to see if I have audio files of orally recorded thoughts to process and then either transfer the files to my computer for transcription and printing, or else listen to the audio files and write the thoughts down myself. <Inevitably: oops, I forgot I had these; oops, device isn't here or isn't charged when I need it; oops, Wi-Fi is on the fritz; oops, I want to reorder, reword, or cross out some of these thoughts but not others, and I can't remember or retain in working memory the whole of my spoken audio to restate it all from scratch; etc.> In a way, doing it by hand avoids the same type of virtualization problems I experience when budgeting and spending and tracking money: doing it physically instead of by computer keeps or makes it \"more real\" to my mind, and I seem to make better decisions and fewer errors. That benefit alone more than makes up for any time supposedly lost in doing it by hand: slow is smooth, and smooth is fast. -- Later Edit --- The slower pace of writing by hand is also a big help because it acts as a filter. I find it helps me to filter out low-value reading (because I easily perceive when analyzing, summarizing, and reacting to something in handwriting would not be a fun or beneficial use of my time). And I find that it helps me filter out my own thoughts (because writing out the less-important ones would similarly take too great a share of the time and energy I have to spend). reply",

          "text": "First of all, listen to your body and calm down. I've been to an otolaryngologist recently because of recurrent dizzy spells. The test results were all good, and the diagnosis was simple: I've been unconsciously flexing my muscles and clenching my teeth. The advice was to build consciousness to this and actively relax. I've then realized that with that flexed state a kind of mental flex follows. I got used to this kind of stressed-out context switching that put my brain in a racing thought state. Noticing when this happens and consciously stopping and then actively releasing the bodily pressure has been an important step in regaining control of my brain.\nI've realized that I kind of conditioned myself to this kind of dopamine seeking that persisted regardless of the medium I'd consume. I'm >30 and therefore skipped the TikTok phase, but even as I got rid of the Instagram habit (it helps that the algorithm is really poor at predicting content I'd want to watch) I would find myself doing the same kind of short bursts of short-term attention and immediate switch even with text-based media such as Reddit or Wikipedia. Try to capture your mental state when you are in this \"mindless consumption\" mode and learn to identify it. Develop a habit to notice when this happens and then stop and ask yourself what are you chasing, after all. Try to pause at the content you're currently reading and read it till the end once you calm down. It also helps to find books that keep your brain active while being engaging to you. I've had a lifelong passion for linguistics and I found myself digging into language philosophy, for example. This is the kind of literature that keeps me engaged, but forces me to slow down as well to think and properly process what I've read. Your mileage may vary; we are different people and definitely you have different interests than me. While I'm not a fantasy fan, I'd be a little wary of picking up fantasy books. My observations tell that the most successful ones read like action movies or first-person video games, and fast-paced action is something you want to steer away from for the purpose of this exercise. Pick up something that challenges you a bit, but is still comprehensible with the context you have right now. reply",

          "text": "Wear a high-quality mask like a KF94 or N95 in public and filter your air. I have been struggling with similar issues. Although writing this alone was a struggle for me, I hope I can offer some helpful advice and information, and I tried my best so bear with me! Reading this will be a nice workout for your brain at the least. --- The pandemic never ended- it just changed shape. The virus keeps changing, and acute symptoms may fade. But for many, the infection never truly ends. A major new review from Yale (Moen, Baker, Iwasaki) offers a comprehensive picture into the neuroimmune pathophysiology of long COVID. Common neurological symptoms in Long COVID include new onset cognitive difficulties, dysautonomia, fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy. Neurological difficulties resulting from COVID infection include reductions in attention span and difficulty maintaining focus for extended periods of time. The brain gets sick from COVID, even when standard scans appear \"normal\". PET imaging has shown reduced glucose metabolism in the brainstem, limbic inflammation, microglia digesting synapses. This is well documented at this point, but here's the link to the Yale study in mention: ttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40536011/ SO MASK UP! COVID is an airborne infectious disease that causes systemic organ damage, including in the brain. -- According to Dr. Michael Hoerger, Director of Pandemic Mitigation Collaborative of Tulane University, latest data shows the current average number of COVID infections per person is at 3.77 as of last week (6/16/25). Pair that with the fact that damage from COVID infections are cumulative and each infection increases your chance of noticeable long-term effects, there's a good chance your issues may stem from COVID-related damage. That's why I recommend to mask indoors to protect your brain from further cognitive damage. You want to reduce the amount of times you get infected as much as possible. Masking is an easy step. If you need access to free masks, check here to get connected with a local group: https://maskbloc.org/ Again, wear a mask! Check if you can get into a long-covid clinic (difficult in many places, I realize) for a neurological evaluation. There are brain exercises and a combination of medication treatments that may be able to help. From another article on a study (I'm so sorry, I'll summarize & put link at bottom), apparently the brain exercise app called BrainHQ (brainhq.com) has shown statically significant cognitive function improvement in long COVID patients. \"The UAB study ... showed significant benefits in many secondary measures, including large to very large benefits on depressive, fatigue, and brain fog symptoms, as well as a significant benefit in brain processing speed, and a trend toward large benefits on anxiety symptoms. No significant change was noted in a measure of global cognition.\" Essentially, \"intensive, repetitive, and progressively challenging activities can drive beneficial changes to the brain.\" However, you do want to be careful with triggering fatigue and post-exertional malaise if you suffer from that, so pacing can be important. Sorry again for making so much reading for you, but I hope this helps. Mask up, eat well, and exercise your brain over time, find a specialist if you can, and things hopefully will get better. I've gotten a lot better with help. Feel free to reply if you have any questions! www.news-medical.net/news/20250505/Breakthrough-brain-training-shows-promise-for-Long-COVID-recovery.aspx reply",

Pretty much nobody ever did, in any society, with few exceptions.  \"Going to America\" was one exception, and then \"going west\".  But for most people, for most of civilization, that has never been an option. And, in fact, the whole system is stacked against us less than it has been for most of the history of civilization.  You aren't a serf.  You aren't a slave.  You aren't an indentured servant, or bound to a ruler or leader in any way. But I think what many people are feeling is the first derivative.  There was a time when the system worked better for people (at least for white males) - say the 1950s or 1960s.  People can feel the first derivative being negative.  They feel the loss of something.  I think that's behind the surge of this sentiment. reply",

Communications, medical, education, e-commerce for anything/everything. We get to play in a lot of different playgrounds and potentially have a huge impact. I don’t think I’ll ever get tired of that. I am tired of the interview process. Here’s a take home assignment that you’ll code in isolation without feedback or interaction from us. Completely opposite of how you’d do the job. You’ll have to justify any assumptions you make. And if we don’t like your justification, pass. Took 2 days on the assignment - this is kind of simplistic, not what we’d expect from a senior dev. Pass. Take 4 days on the assignment - what took so long? We’d expect a senior dev to knock this out in 2 or 3 days. Pass. Maybe we’ll tell you’re out. Or we’ll just ghost you. Depends on how our recruiting team is feeling that day. Behavioral is generally where I “blow” it. I won’t lie and answer the “so tell me a time about xyz”. Sometimes xyz was terrible, and I didn’t handle it well. I know how I’d handle it now and can articulate that. Sorry. We’re looking for someone that handled this exactly right already. Personally I screwed myself over the years by not chasing titles. I’ve done Staff and Principal level stuff. For years. But I didn’t fight for the title. So I generally get screened out of those pretty quickly because past titles don’t match what recruiting team has been told to look for. But this is the price that must be paid.

I can leave the company, try to change it from the inside and accept the consequences, or adapt to the situation until I can find or create something better.

The temporary dopamine hit from getting sympathy venting and believing that the rest of the world is crazy makes me feel like something has changed when nothing has or perhaps will. And that just causes me to feel worse over time. It's also interesting to see how opinions of what is fair, right, reasonsable, etc start to change as the contributor becomes a manager of a team and then an owner. The individual's context can have a lot to do with shaping the opinion. reply",

I was frustrated with work-life balance, interview processes, etc. Here people are comparing software development with minimum wage jobs and saying you should be thankful. Ok try comparing with equivalent jobs. Many non-tech corporate jobs have similar or better work life balance. I have friends who were recently hired with one or two interviews. Pay may not be as high but their stress levels also seem a lot lower. So I came close to switching career, took classes, talked to potential employers, they seemed eager to hire me. But I got cold feet. I thought about my dreams and decided to pursue one of my hobbies as a side business with ultimate goal of doing it full-time. At this point, job is simply a means to end Yeah, I have heard that one way to ruin a hobby is to monetize it. Maybe it will happen to me eventually but I don’t feel burned out anymore. I’m energetic every morning, I work hard at my current job because it is providing seed money for my dream business. This is to say go ahead try switching industry, take classes, make new friends, figure out something. Talking to various people actually helped me figure out my dreams. reply",

          "text": "The core issue here isn't just market conditions or bad hiring practices. It's that tech _workers_ have spent decades thinking they were somehow different from other _workers_, that they were 'partners' with capital rather than the labor behind it. You're experiencing what people in every other industry have dealt with for generations: being treated as a disposable cost center when it's convenient for ownership. The solution isn't individual resilience or '''grinding harder''', it's collective action. Tech workers need to organize. We need unions. We need to stop pretending that stock options and ping pong tables make us anything other than workers whose interests are fundamentally opposed to those who fire us on a whim to boost quarterly numbers. The people who laid you off, who are outsourcing jobs, who are trying to replace workers with AI — they are not on your side! They never were! This is class warfare, and we tech workers have been deluding ourselves supporting the wrong side. reply",

No matter which products I worked on, the same feelings of depression and ultimately loathing of the environment and process kept returning. Don't get me wrong. My employer is world-class, and the benefits were amazing, but the software development and engineering culture are destroying their employees. A sabbatical to rethink my career is in order. I've saved for the past 20 years and realized that unless I take time now, I might never have the real opportunity to enjoy life the way I’ve dreamed. I now have two years of savings set aside, so we will see where life takes me. I might work for myself or simply step down from technology development into a new role. Modern software engineering is killing its employees. Global teams across time zones working from 5:00am to 10:00pm., on projects that aren’t even mine—just because someone else left and needed someone competent to pick up the slack and carry the project to completion.

Yes to the first part, it's just like code. Write once, then run it perpetually. Except that isn't really the case. There are still jobs for maintaining COBOL systems. Likewise, legacy hardware needs to be replaced, improved, or repaired. Old companies die, new ones swoop in and capture market share. My employer is the only manufacturer I know of for a legacy system component. They have a captive market because no one else wants to take the two weeks in CAD, and phone time with the contract manufacturers.

Got laid of in 2003, 2021, and recently 2025 a few months ago.  Software development is now just a hobby for me now. From what I have seen the job market is very specific. The recruiters are only looking for rare skill sets, but also folks who have the update skill sets for cloud migration projects. What has made the field bad is fragmentation of development. C/C++ was the meal ticket years ago. I remember in 2003 I had to get a java programmers cert just to get a job, back then 1000 people would apply for 1 job, then in 2004 the job market opened back up. After a few months I finally got a job interview this week. Someone called back from a previous job I worked on. I have noticed that a lot of places development is offshore in India or eastern europe. It's not just ai that is taken jobs, but also cutbacks in government contracting.  The tech layoff wave that started in 2022 was partially fueled by a change in the US tax code, specifically Section 174 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This change significantly altered how companies could deduct research and development (R&D) expenses. Previously, companies could fully deduct R&D costs in the year they were incurred, but the TCJA mandated that these expenses be amortized over several years (5 years for domestic and 15 years for foreign). This resulted in higher tax burdens for tech companies, especially those heavily invested in R&D. reply",

          "text": "I didn't intend to say \"do your own thing\" to mean \"make no effort to generate any earned income.\" You could instead slow down and take on a la carte freelance/contract work. -Or you could take a risk for a couple years, and maybe your project launches into the abyss of space, never to be seen by a single soul; at least you'll have something to show for your work gap years. -But I would caution against treating life too much like an Excel spreadsheet, too. It's never going to turn out anything like you plan, and I'd advise to critically examine wealth advisor boilerplate. At least for federal US tax code filing HoH (which is what I'm familiar with), we get >$60k tax-free to realize in long-term capital gains each year. If you can generate what you need now to live on with investment growth at least matching inflation -- and I'll point out you can get a serviceable house on an acre in a safe neighborhood for <$150k in most US states if you're willing to live away from a major metro -- you can likely generate enough to live on in retirement, especially if social security and medicare still exist. I take ~$20k/year in contract work and keep my unearned income under $11,950 for EITC purposes, with remainder/majority of my annual deduction eaten at least partially by my daughter's capital gains (she gets SSI survivorship which I dump directly into an individual/unsheltered brokerage account), and without mortgage payments, things are peachy -- I don't even spend that much per year. reply",

Coding, it turns out, is the easy part, which can be done by AIs as of 2025 :) Identifying important business problems to solve, and translating those into engineering systems is still beyond the reach of AIs (luckily). That said, human's job is getting harder everyday. Expectations go up every f'in year. The demands often look impossible (it turns out this is how you get the most out of people). So best of luck!

          "text": "Since MCP is itself an API protocol, we have to say no . I think what you're after is, \"Will MCP interactions under the hood replace or supplant traditional GUI interactions where the human is expected to click several things on a website?\" To that, I would say it's possible. The problem is not with MCP existing or not existing. The underlying APIs that make every app possible on the backend are already there whether you wire them up to the front with a GUI or MCP. The problem is that API calls almost never map directly to UI appearance. Typically, the app has to examine quite a bit of state to decide what API call should be sent, what parameters it should contain, and what should be done to the UI with its result. Those connections are built by humans with a deep understanding of the underlying API. Often the UI and \"user intent\" side of the house is entirely separate from the API or \"data provider\" side and it takes some finesse to marry the two. MCP offers no help here and asking an LLM to guess which API should be called is likely to make things worse unless it's carefully corralled. To me, this creates a serious moat for vertical applications that are tightly focused on one kind of RAG use case, whether they use MCP or not. If the app exhibits an \"intuitive\" understanding of the working data and adjusts the UI in a way that makes sense to the user, it adds value that's difficult for a competitor to copy -- and impossible for anyone outside the subject domain. This explains the Cursor moat, which seems misunderstood. Cursor is the mostly tightly integrated and best example of a RAG application in any domain. It's no surprise that software development is the first industry to see a benefit from this concept. We write everything for ourselves first. But apps that implement this kind of \"closed loop\" RAG over a specific subject domain and data will replace the traditional kind that only have a GUI or CLI. reply",

          "text": "Yes, the company I work for has started using Hololens 2. We have a program that can overlay the 3D models from our CAD program onto the physical steel assemblies for QC. When it works, it works well and enables our quality checkers to perform checks faster and more accurately than using tape measures while going back and forth looking at a 2D drawing printed on 11 x 17 paper. The biggest hurdles is that none of the large companies think there is enough profit to be made from AR. The Hololens 2 is the only headset on the market both capable of running the program required while also being safe to use in a active shop enviroment (VR with passthrough is not suitable). Unfortunately the Hololens 2 is almost 6 years old as is being stretched to the absolute limits of its hardware capabilities. The technology is good but feels like it is only 90% of the way to where it needs to be. Even a simple revision with double the RAM and faster more power efficient processor would alleviate many of the issues we've experienced. Ultimately from what I've seen, AR is about making the human user better at their job and there are tons of industries where it could have many applications, but tech companies don't actually want to make things that could be directly useful to people that work with their hands, so instead we will just continue to toss more money at AI hoping to make ourselves obsolete. reply",

I am curious, what size of clients are you working with and how many contracts has it realistically turned into?

What I am noticing is a chicken/egg problem where companies want proof it works, while also reluctant to put their money where their mouth is and invest in the R&D.

          "text": "We work with all of the large general contractors in the steel construction industry. Right now, it's turned into one contract, but we are the second company the client has employed since the first company they hired failed to produce a single assembly that met their requirements. The client was the one that originally was using this tech since they wanted a way to do their own QC after the first experience, and we decided it was worth while pursuing ourselves since successfully pulling this project off while be a HUGE boost to our reputation. The construction industry is all about your portfolio of past projects. QA is the big sales point of the software we are using, but there are many other  potential applications for the same product. It should be possible to overlay the model on the main assembly prefab then use that to quickly mark where holes should be drilled and additional pieces attached. The other potential application that is being explored is using the holographic overlays to construct things out of the usual order, instead of building part 1 then starting part 2 since it needs to be built to conform to the first part you can instead build around the hologram so that your not relying on the previously built parts to ensure your angles are correct. I agree about the chicken/egg problem. Its an emerging technology where the payoff might be a decade away, customers need software that will actually benefit them, developers need reliable hardware capable of running software that has practical uses, and hardware companies want to know there is a customer base. The issue is AR falls under the category of product that the customer does not know they actually want, so the only way it is going to be developed is if one of the hardware manufactures takes a leap of faith and makes the long term investment. Sadly, I feel like AR is a million dollar idea with practical uses that has to contend with a business climate where you can make billions making some doodad that collects private data then displays ads to the masses. reply",

The past decade of devices (hololens, realwear, google glass, vuzix, etc) were some combination of way too heavy, expensive, fragile, short battery life, no wifi connectivity, too much UI long to get to point of value and/or simply not useful. That and most customers had a content problem. The AR/VR use in the field typically came down to looking something up in a manual or calling someone. Both easily and perhaps more effectively done on a smartphone. There was an instance where I asked techs why they weren't using the headset for showing what they were seeing in realtime and they said, it's easier to facetime (hard to argue that). The cool AR 3-D demos or overlays rarely worked in the field on real equip or didn't actually convey anything useful (everyone knows the basics of how the machine works). There are training VR use cases (like learning to operate a crane), but once again it's a nice to have supplement and not a replacement.

That's pretty interesting, do you even need a screen, or just voice? I would think a pretty quick-and-dirty way to do it is to take pdf forms, enumerate (put small numbers) next to every editable field, and then use voice commands like, \"write the following in field 3: ....\" The purpose of having a screen would be to verify what the LLM + voice is inputting in the form.

My second most ergonomic situation is a 120\" screen with two 55\" screens tilting in from both sides (both in portrait, so all 3 screen verticals line up). All wall mounted. I started wall mounting to get screens off my desk, at which point it was clear bigger was always better. But for the Vision it took many rounds of trying third party head gear, and customization, before I could wear it comfortably for unlimited time. I just kept trying things until I got there. I am an obsessive optimist when it comes to ergonomics. Once the Vision is ergonomic for one's head, then it becomes a super ergonomic solution over all. The screen can be wherever you need it for best neck, back and body posture, whether at a desk, couch, (non-driving) car seat, or in bed. And a very wide screen beats any screen patchwork. Although I would like the Vision even more if I could have more than one Mac driven screen when I wanted to.

Pleasantly surprised how usable it is for 3-6 hour stretches, more productive than just a laptop screen alone. At home I'll likely return to physical monitors though. Tips: Get an upgraded headband, silicone face cover and carrying case. Use a physical USB connection for lower latency (& turn off the wifi/bluetooth as it's no longer needed). Bring a cloth for keeping the lenses clean. Bump the Retina quality up in the Immersed client (on Mac). Lower resolutions (1920x1080) are more comfortable to use over longer periods. Use a travel neck pillow for reclined usage. Bring replacement batteries and a charger for the controllers. reply",

It's not actually the weight. I have a Quest 3 with a BoboVR head strap, external battery, etc that all add up to be heavier than the AVP, but I can easily go for multi-hour social sessions with that on without any physical discomfort. You can put a ton of weight on your head with perfect comfort as long as it's balanced properly. The AVP's real problem is that its ergonomics are just shit. As with a bunch of other things, they designed for the ads instead of actual usability, so it's significantly worse than headsets that are actually much heavier, and the earband design with the way-too-far-back connectors and no top connections makes it nigh impossible for third parties to improve on it. The closest thing I've seen to making it comfortable is the third-party ResMed Kontor headstrap, and that's being produced in such low numbers that it's functionally impossible to actually buy. reply",

I think the key issue is whether or not it adds enough value to justify buying everybody a headset, and for our use case I don't know if it does, though I'm just a lowly programmer, I don't know what the customers think about it. We have another product that's geared towards collaborating and sharing data between teams and vendors, and it seems better suited there, but that one is a web application, and I don't know how well VR glasses are supported there. I think it'd be awesome in the CAD applications themselves but I don't know if any of them support it out of the box. reply",

First responders and retailers have some of the largest internal deployments out there, but they aren’t massively publicized (most people would never guess who’s fielding the largest fleet of headsets right now). That said, it’s still not mass adoption. At the end of the day, you are asking someone to put something on their face that is still very different ergonomically than glasses (and I’m not sure even glasses would overcome enough friction). The ROI has to overcome the business (or personal) friction of buying the hardware, the friction of the form factor plus any friction from changed workflows. Now put that in an operational workflow instead of training and the risks go up. Most are still skeptical of device reliability (not to say there aren’t suitable devices for operational roles but the perception is still a hurdle, and the applicability is often device-specific). Now add on to that limited experience with devices (many decision makers have never put one on), added security complications, specialized software development skills, limited content libraries and very real accessibility concerns and a lot of enterprises can never get past an “innovation center demo.” For many industries the value proposition just isn’t there yet. But that said, I’d recommend digging a little deeper as there’s a lot of existing use-cases and deployments, both failed and successful, outside of IVAS. reply",

          "text": "Hello! I spent a lot of time in graduate school researching AR/VR technology (specifically regarding its utility as an accessibility tool) and learning about barriers to adoption. In my opinion, there are three major hurdles preventing widespread adoption of this modality: 1. *Weight*: To achieve powerful computation like that of the HoloLens, you need powerful processing. The simplest solution to this is to put the processing in the device, which adds weight to it. The HoloLens 2 weighs approximately 566g (or 1.24lb), which is a LOT of weight compared to a pair of traditional glasses, which weigh approximately 20-50g. Speaking as someone who developed with the HL2 for a few years, all-day wear with the device is uncomfortable and untenable. The weight of the device HAS to be comfortable for all-day use, otherwise it hinders adoption. 2. *Battery*: Ironically, making the device smaller to accommodate all-day wear means that you're simultaneously reducing its battery life, which reduces its utility as an all-day wearable: any onboard battery must be smaller, and thus store less energy. This is a problematic trade-off: you don't want the device to weigh too much that people can't wear it, but you also don't want the device to weigh too little that it ceases to have function. 3. *Social Acceptability*: This is where I have some expertise, as it was the subject of my research. Simply put, if a wearer feels as though they stand out by wearing an XR device, they're hesitant to wear it at all when interacting with others. This means that an XR device must not be ostentatious, as the Apple Vision Pro, HoloLens, MagicLeap, and Google Glass all were. In recent years, there have been a lot of strides in this space, but there's a long way to go. Firstly, there is increasingly an understanding that the futuristic devices we see in sci-fi cannot be achieved with onboard computation (yet). That said, local, bidirectional, wireless streaming between a lightweight XR device (glasses) and a device with stronger processing power (a la smartphone) provides a potential weigh of offloading computation from the device itself, and simply displaying results onboard. Secondly, Li+ battery tech continues to improve, and there are now [simple head-worn displays capable of rendering text and bitmaps]( https://www.vuzix.com/products/z100-smart-glasses ) with a battery life of an entire day. There is also active development work by the folks at [Mentra (YC W25)]( https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/mentra ) on highlighting these devices' utility, even with their limited processing power. Lastly, with the first two developments combined, social acceptability is improving dramatically! There are lots of new head-worn displays emerging with varying levels of ability. There was the recent [Android XR keynote]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nv1snJRCEI ), which shows some impressive spatial awareness, as well as the [Mentra Live]( https://mentra.glass/pages/live ) (an open-source Meta Raybans clone). In terms of limited displays with social acceptability, there are the [Vuzix Z100]( https://www.vuzix.com/products/z100-smart-glasses ), and [Even Realities G1]( https://www.evenrealities.com/g1 ), which can display basic information (that still has a lot of utility!). As an owner of the Vuzix Z100 and a former developer in the XR space, the progress is slow, but steady. The rapid improvements in machine learning (specifically in STT, TTS, and image understanding) indirectly improve the AR space as well. reply",

          "text": "We’ve developed VR based industrial safety training, as a self-contained, portable product for blue collar workers in India - launched about 24 months ago with regular updates. Multiple companies have bought it, and we have large companies as clients who’ve used it to train 1000s of their blue-collar workers, even in sectors such as construction in a relatively challenging (in terms of pricing and value) market. We have a significant (I think!) number of devices deployed, and most of my clients end up purchasing more after the initial purchase and pilot. I think that’s for a few reasons: 1) VR, when well designed, can offer 1st person experience of being an accident victim due to the viewer’s own oversight / someone else’s oversight. That makes it a far more effective way to draw the learner’s attention to the importance of the safety protocols, etc. 2) Our solution is multi-lingual: it’s currently available in 10 regional Indian languages - that matters, since a significant fraction of the workforce may not understand English. Our localisation extends beyond that, but language is a big thing in enabling access and usage. 3) if you have to invest 10-15 min per learner (often one-on-one as the instructor) to onboard each learner before they can use your solution, it becomes very difficult to scale and raises the bar for cost-effectiveness. So that’s something we focus on heavily. 4) Setup time- don’t create a solution that requires IT support, someone who understands how to setup / load SteamVR / Oculus Link / meta Horizon. If the solution adds 20-30 min workload to the staff on a site, then adopting it becomes that much more painful - so we’ve worked very hard to develop an integrated system where the instructor can quickly onboard 10-15 learners and get going with the session in 5 min. 5) workflow changes: often, introducing VR means changing some part of the organisation’s workflow - many VR solutions don’t consider this / acknowledge this in their design- clients get initially excited, but when it comes to actually using it on a daily basis, the deployment and workflow frictions can completely tank VR adoption. I’ve seen multiple solutions fail because of this, and we focus extensively on this when we design our solutions. India is a hard market for VR, honestly because it’s very price sensitive. But I think we’ve made some progress here, because we’ve focused extensively on system robustness, ease of deployment, localization, and a lot of user-centered design. We’ve also developed sophisticated VR - based training solutions for SOP training. VR can be / is, very effective for initial onboarding and SOP training. Again, the challenge here is usability - most of the learner’s don’t know how to use the controllers. Learning how to use the controllers is not easy and takes time. So that onboarding is critical and needs to be done well. In SOP training, our experience is that it can, if designed well, significantly reduce on-boarding time; however, you still need the last 20% of training on the actual thing for it to stick, and for the learner to actually _learn_.

          "text": "AR is much harder as a solution to deploy at scale, I think. First off, most solutions work poorly out in day light - especially the bright Indian sun. So that automatically adds friction in terms of deployment opportunities / field deployment. The second issue is the limited FoV: 40-45 degrees. That's a pretty small display area to play with in terms of pushing detailed information, etc. Third, again, the usability, ruggedness and user-onboarding challenges. So, the use case has to be important enough and significant enough that the user / organization needs to accept all these frictions and still derive enough value out of the solution - that leaves very few use cases. Add to that, HoloLens is expensive, hasn’t seen any significant development in the past few years, and real wear type devices too aren’t cheap for large scale adoption - a smartphone / tablet in hand is often a better / more maintainable / cost effective solution even compared to real wear - I’ve seen clients securely mount a smartphone on their helmet and setup a teams call for remote viewing - it works! reply",

Some of the current customers might be able to use ANY distribution to patch problems for a while. Eventually, someone mightneed to decide on serious maintenance or not. But initially it quite possibly would not require much. When there are current users, the future may not be a thriving project but may be simply a patched up current solution. Nothing wrong with that. I suspect this is the case pretty often: a current solution is not great but it's in place. The code itself is nothing to write home about, but it's in place. Patching problems in the code might be the easier path for the user. reply",

Despite not planning carefully, and even in pre-industrial societies where a lot more problems were rapidly fatal and the best you could hope for in such cases regarding childcare allowance was a shotgun marriage, vibing it generally works. With more certainty: I'm not sure what the distribution is of women hearing about painful births and saying \"nope!\", but I do know it's more than none. I know a few deliberately childfree couples who like the higher income and lack of responsibility, and have zero interest in proposals such as this. reply",

The data is robust that some don’t want children out of economic reasons, and others don’t want them out of lifestyle choices (prioritizing self over a thankless job). Across several national pro natalist policy programs, the evidence shows that even when enormous amounts of benefits are provided, it barely moves the realized fertility outcome. (40% of pregnancies in the US and internationally, annually, are unintentional, and we have enough humans we don’t take care of already [1], we should be radically empowering as many as people who don’t want to have kids to not have them) [1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44407283 reply",

Consider: the government pays a salary to each married family while they raise children; the salary would be equivalent to a blue-collar job, and it would scale with the number of children up to a point (e.g. 4 kids). I strongly believe that'd lead to many more marriages and childbirths. Many people not interested in raising kids would prefer it over a \"regular\" job. Families with adoptive children would also be paid, so it could decrease adoption difficulty and stigma as a side-effect.

One way the state also pays for children is by having them have basically free healthcare in your name. No extra costs for that in the first 18(?) years. The weird thing about Kindergeld ist that everyone gets that, no matter if you earn good or not. There are ways to get more of you are poor, but the base is basically basic income for your child.

Though Apple's lack of native 3rd party search engine support has been annoying, and it requires various hacks from Kagi to make it work. That's my only gripe, but that's on Apple. The hardest things for me have been email and maps. The switching cost for email, especially one I've had since the gmail beta, is astronomically high. I don't think I will ever be able to fully delete the account (though I did delete about 5 alt email accounts I had with Gmail). Maps has also been hard, as Google Maps is my go-to place for business information and reviews. I use Apple Maps for actual navigation, but their POI and business data is severely lacking, and the lean on Yelp doesn't cut it. Kagi maps is being developed, but has a long way to go, and to get to the point of Google Maps... I don't think they have keep enough pockets for that. And there is YouTube of course, which is Google owned. There is really no good alternative for that. reply",

          "text": "I joked to a colleague that I’d pay google workspace another $10 a month just to remove the Gemini features. We are actively looking for a workspace alternative. We tested out proton’s ‘business suite’, and it just doesn’t come close. Proton Pass is nice, but the ‘drive’ feature doesn’t have anything remotely close to what the Google Drive / Docs / Sheets / Slides ecosystem has. It also seems relatively new, so we’ll revisit it in a few months hopefully. We also tested out Microsoft teams, and no, just no. It’s just really convenient to onboard employees and the browser management with chrome is ultimately the deciding factor, as well as not having to worry about email deliverability. I feel like there is a somewhat big market for someone who wants to take on the Google workspace / MS teams products. For the most part, I feel like this wouldn’t be difficult to build besides the email deliverability part being most crucial. Along with forking chromium or Firefox and reimplementing the browser management system, which also can maybe be done with an extension. reply",

Ideally, your service processes are waiting on i/o (epoll, select, kqread, etc) or you're CPU limited. Is there any cross-room communication? Can you spawn a process per room? Scaling limited at 25% CPU on a 4 vcpu node strongly suggests a locked section limiting you to effectively single threaded performance. Multiple processes serving rooms should bypass that if you can't find it otherwise, but maybe there's something wrong in your load balancing etc. Personally, I'd rather run with fewer layers, because then you don't have to debug the layers when you have perf issues. Do matchmaking wherever with whatever layers, and let your room servers run in the host os, no containers. But nobody likes my ideas. :P Edit to add: your network load is tiny. This is almost certainly something with your software, or how you've setup your layers. Unless those vCPUs are ancient , you should be able to push a whole lot more packets. reply",

There is no cross-room communication. I could spawn a process per room but I was trying to address this issue with my current Docker setup where I have multiple `game` containers that run a single node.js process and each process can host multiple rooms. Not having to use Docker sounds simpler but it's that's where I'm at atm haha. I agree that the network load feels very small. Maybe it's a socket.io related issue where when many broadcasts are being fired at once, then a shared I/O step gets bottlenecked? Here's my actual typing broadcast code, I was originally broadcasting from the socket event callback itself but I found performance improved slightly by batching broadcasts per player in a setInterval loop (also note that only 1 player in a given room can be typing at once, so batching broadcasts per room shouldn't address the bottleneck). /**\n   * Used to handle very frequent typing events more gracefully to avoid overloading CPU\n   */\n  const TypingUsersMap = new Map<\n    ConnectionId,\n    {\n      socketId: string | null; // doesn't exist for bots\n      roomId: PublicRoomId;\n      userId: UserId;\n      currentInput: string;\n    }\n  >();\n\n  type ConnectionId = `${UserId}:${PublicRoomId}`;\n\n  // ! this should be same as client throttle interval\n  const TYPING_BROADCAST_INTERVAL = 200;\n\n  export let typingBroadcastInterval: NodeJS.Timeout | undefined = undefined;\n  export const startTypingBroadcastJob = () => {\n    typingBroadcastInterval = setInterval(() => {\n      const freshTypingUsersMap = new Map(TypingUsersMap);\n      TypingUsersMap.clear();\n\n      if (freshTypingUsersMap.size === 0) return; // Nothing to do\n\n      // Go through each user that has a pending update\n      for (const [_connectionId, data] of freshTypingUsersMap.entries()) {\n        const socket = data.socketId\n          ? io.sockets.sockets.get(data.socketId)\n          : undefined;\n\n        // Use the data we stored to perform the broadcast\n        if (socket) {\n          // emit to other players\n          socket\n            .to(data.roomId)\n            .volatile.emit(\n              SOCKET_EVENT_NAMES.USER_TYPING_RES,\n              data.userId,\n              data.currentInput\n            );\n        } else {\n          // bots emit to everyone\n          io.to(data.roomId).volatile.emit(\n            SOCKET_EVENT_NAMES.USER_TYPING_RES,\n            data.userId,\n            data.currentInput\n          );\n        }\n      }\n    }, TYPING_BROADCAST_INTERVAL);\n  };\n\n  export const stopTypingBroadcastJob = () => {\n    if (typingBroadcastInterval) {\n      clearInterval(typingBroadcastInterval);\n      typingBroadcastInterval = undefined;\n    }\n  };\n\n  // this is called from the USER_TYPING socket event callback. so effectively every throttled keystroke by the user gets queued.\n  export const queueTypingEvent = ({\n    socketId,\n    roomId,\n    userId,\n    currentInput,\n  }: {\n    socketId: string | null;\n    roomId: PublicRoomId;\n    userId: UserId;\n    currentInput: string;\n  }) => {\n    const connectionId: ConnectionId = `${userId}:${roomId}`;\n    TypingUsersMap.set(connectionId, {\n      socketId,\n      roomId,\n      userId,\n      currentInput,\n    });\n  }; reply",

Instead consider: * the number of total sockets as I suspect there could be multiple sockets per user. * investigate what socket.io does to serialize messages both on and off the wire. I wrote my own WebSocket library for Node and noticed the cost to process messages on the receiving end is about 11x greater than on the sending end. Normally that doesn’t matter until you push it past a critical point. At the critical point everything begins to super crawl because the message quantity per interval exceeds the garbage collection cycle and everything backs up. In my case this scenario didn’t realize until 180000 or 480000 messages per second depending upon the hardware. The critical difference from the hardware side was only about memory speed and cpu availability was largely irrelevant. * also look at what socket.io does, if at all, to queue messages at each side of the socket. Message queued both on and off the wire will be a factor if not properly managed or if absent reply",

This makes me think Thailand may not be a wise place to buy property. The site would help reduce future scams like this by steering people to less corrupt places. And in any country I think off the plan development is highly risky. You are trusting building companies famous for going bankrupt substantial amounts of money.

Hence, why the construction took a halt during 1 year. They were selling at a discount to break even, the government was indeed talking about opening borders (we were already inside Thailand at that time, not buying from abroad). We visited the construction site and saw ~10 workers, everything seemed real, like a thing slowly getting back to normal. I have all the reasons to believe now, that these \"workers\" were just paid to be here. The company was advertising, getting batches of potential investors, and making a \"Potemkin\" construction site. They never had any intention of ever finishing the project. reply",

Then I’d buy some backlinks and make it SEO-friendly so it ranks well on Google. I’d set up a Facebook page, post updates regularly, and drive people to both the site and the YouTube channel. I’d run Facebook ads for months—whatever I could afford, ideally at least $2k, but the more, the better. I’d reply to every comment and encourage people to share and speak up. Once that’s all set up, I’d reach out to media outlets—ask them directly how much it costs to feature my site in their digital editions, and from there, figure out what it takes to get something printed in physical form. Depending on how things go after the first month, I’d even consider renting 1 or 2 billboards. reply",

          "text": "Exposing a scam involving a powerful figure is a serious and potentially risky task that must be approached with caution, integrity, and strong evidence. Here’s how one might responsibly and safely proceed: 1. Gather Verifiable Evidence\nCollect documented proof: emails, financial records, contracts, messages, or recordings. Ensure the evidence is authentic, legal to possess, and can withstand scrutiny. 2. Protect Yourself First\nUse secure communication tools (like Signal, ProtonMail, or Tails OS). Anonymize your identity if necessary using VPNs or the Tor network. Consult a lawyer, digital security expert, or whistleblower organization to assess risks. 3. Approach Reputable Investigative Journalists\nTrusted outlets (like The Guardian, ProPublica, or The Intercept) often have secure channels for tips. Choose those with a track record of handling sensitive leaks. 4. Consider Legal Avenues\nFile a report with relevant authorities or anti-corruption bodies (if they are independent and trustworthy). Whistleblower protection laws may apply in some jurisdictions—understand your rights. 5. Avoid Public Accusations Without Proof\nPublicly accusing someone powerful without solid evidence can backfire legally and personally. Focus on exposing facts, not opinions or personal attacks.

          "text": "I'm truly sorry to hear what happened to your mother — she deserved peace, not deception. The scope and international nature of this scam is staggering, and it's commendable that you're trying to fight back. You're not just seeking justice for your mother but potentially protecting future victims. Here are some ideas to help you move forward, both tactically and ethically: 1. Taking the Battle Online – Strategies for Exposure\nHere are a few creative yet responsible ways you could expose the scam: Documentation Website (OSINT + Testimonies)\nCreate a well-structured website (e.g., thailandpropertyscam.org) that: Publishes redacted documents, contracts, and communications. Shares stories from multiple victims (anonymized if necessary). Maps out relationships (via OSINT) between shell companies and individuals. Is translated into several languages to target global victims/investors. Make sure it's SEO-optimized with the scammer’s real name, aliases, company names, and keywords like “Thailand property scam,” “[Company Name] reviews,” etc. Coordinate with Other Victims\nTry to organize victims using a private group (Telegram, Signal, or ProtonMail-based email list). With their consent, a class-action type of presence (even informal) gives more weight. Strategic Disruption\nYour idea of having fake investors back out after referencing your exposé can work as “reputational attrition.” But be cautious: don't fabricate anything — just share documented truth. Plant seeds of doubt with facts. Leverage Reddit, YouTube, and TikTok\nPlatforms like: r/scams, r/Thailand, r/ExpatFIRE, r/RealEstate — have active communities. A well-produced YouTube video titled “My Mom Got Scammed by a Politician’s Daughter in Thailand” could go viral. TikTok/Instagram Reels — emotional 30-60 second clips reach wide audiences. Also post on forums like Expat.com and local-language equivalents in countries of other victims. 2. Finding Journalists / Influencers / Whistleblower Networks\nA few avenues to explore: Journalist Networks\nForbidden Stories OCCRP ICIJ — reach out with your evidence. Bellingcat — they may be interested in OSINT-related scams. Freelance Investigative Journalists\nPost on: JournoRequests (via Twitter/X) Help a Reporter Out (HARO) Indie outlets like Rest of World, Vice World News, and even Asia Sentinel. Local Influencers and Advocates\nThai anti-corruption activists (check Twitter and Facebook). YouTubers or bloggers in the expat/real estate space. Retired expats in Thailand often blog about scams — look for bloggers on TeakDoor.com or ThaiVisaForum.com. A Note on Safety & Censorship\nThailand has extremely strict defamation and lèse-majesté laws. Be extremely careful if you host or write anything from within Thailand or use your name. Use offshore hosting, anonymous WHOIS, VPNs, and consider using services like GlobaLeaks to share information safely. You may even consider getting legal advice from digital rights orgs like: Electronic Frontier Foundation Privacy International Final Thought\nYou’re doing something brave and important. While you may not win legally in Thailand, the internet can be a powerful equalizer. Done ethically and transparently, your efforts can protect others and bring some justice to light. If you do create a site or content, I’m sure many here (myself included) would be willing to help share or amplify it. Stay safe and good luck. reply",
