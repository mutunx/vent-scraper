          "text": "Try this: never read without a pencil in your hand. Make it a point to not only orally or mentally restate but also rewrite by hand everything you read (on-screen and in real life) in your own words, and to make multiple drafts of each restatement until it is as succinct, orderly, and logical as possible. This practice will probably help you: * recognize and stop reading low-value material; * read less on your phone; * deeply understand what you're reading; * identify errors in what you're reading; * identify errors in your own understanding; * improve your own writing (and possibly your handwriting!); * recall what you've read and what it says and means; and * build a record of your reading, reactions, and thinking. And, of course, I think it should improve your ability to focus. You can also make flashcards while you're at it (again, handwritten ones) and develop a spaced-repetition practice for the important information and skills. --- Later Edit --- You mention long-form text in particular. One of the most effective tactics to use while reading is to discern the writing's architecture/structure — at all levels, from the writing's genre, to its main components and their arrangement, to how each main part is composed, and so on. Doing so not only helps to understand and critique the author's ideas, but also becomes a fun game that keeps your attention directed. And also keep in mind that > 99% of all writing is not only not great but also probably not worth reading in the first place. It's ok to use boredom as a guide: your mind may be indicating through boredom and distraction that what you're reading isn't worth the time and effort and attention it takes to do so. But if you have decided that you must read something, or that you want to read it and understand it, then I've found that there's no substitute for the handwriting technique.

          "text": "Well, physicality is part of the point: it slows the writer down and provides more engagement with text (with the text being read; and the text representing the reader's ideas about the text being read; and the text representing the reader's ideas about text representing the reader's (prior) ideas about the text being read). Furthermore, handling, pushing around, and organizing actual paper on an actual desktop has (in my experience) effects on the mind that are both different in kind and superior in degree to those achieved by merely thinking, speaking, or typing about something. The availability and simplicity are part of the point too: pencils and paper are ubiquitous; and easily found and inexpensively purchased if not immediately available. Written jots and drafts of ideas, summaries, and reactions (of the kind we're talking about here) are easy and quick to make; they readily reveal their content; and they're easy and quick to view simultaneously, to rearrange, to stack, reorder, organize, store, and share. Compare voice recorders: the devices are not ubiquitous and are costly; they break and are costly to repair or replace; they have many dependencies (batteries/charging/charging plugs; switches prone to failure; firmware; drivers; USB plugs or adapters that can become missing, damaged, or obsolete themselves); etc. And compare the audio tapes or audio files: they don't really and fully reveal their content by glancing at them; they're hard to keep track of; and they're more difficult to change or reorganize. All that said, I think voice recorders have a place and I use a dictaphone myself on occasion — but primarily to spit out several ideas quickly when time is of the essence, I'm afraid I'll lose the thoughts, or I can't find the words to describe them in writing but somehow can blab about the gist of them to create a sort of bookmark for later processing. But then I have to remember to check to see if I have audio files of orally recorded thoughts to process and then either transfer the files to my computer for transcription and printing, or else listen to the audio files and write the thoughts down myself. <Inevitably: oops, I forgot I had these; oops, device isn't here or isn't charged when I need it; oops, Wi-Fi is on the fritz; oops, I want to reorder, reword, or cross out some of these thoughts but not others, and I can't remember or retain in working memory the whole of my spoken audio to restate it all from scratch; etc.> In a way, doing it by hand avoids the same type of virtualization problems I experience when budgeting and spending and tracking money: doing it physically instead of by computer keeps or makes it \"more real\" to my mind, and I seem to make better decisions and fewer errors. That benefit alone more than makes up for any time supposedly lost in doing it by hand: slow is smooth, and smooth is fast. -- Later Edit --- The slower pace of writing by hand is also a big help because it acts as a filter. I find it helps me to filter out low-value reading (because I easily perceive when analyzing, summarizing, and reacting to something in handwriting would not be a fun or beneficial use of my time). And I find that it helps me filter out my own thoughts (because writing out the less-important ones would similarly take too great a share of the time and energy I have to spend). reply",

          "text": "First of all, listen to your body and calm down. I've been to an otolaryngologist recently because of recurrent dizzy spells. The test results were all good, and the diagnosis was simple: I've been unconsciously flexing my muscles and clenching my teeth. The advice was to build consciousness to this and actively relax. I've then realized that with that flexed state a kind of mental flex follows. I got used to this kind of stressed-out context switching that put my brain in a racing thought state. Noticing when this happens and consciously stopping and then actively releasing the bodily pressure has been an important step in regaining control of my brain.\nI've realized that I kind of conditioned myself to this kind of dopamine seeking that persisted regardless of the medium I'd consume. I'm >30 and therefore skipped the TikTok phase, but even as I got rid of the Instagram habit (it helps that the algorithm is really poor at predicting content I'd want to watch) I would find myself doing the same kind of short bursts of short-term attention and immediate switch even with text-based media such as Reddit or Wikipedia. Try to capture your mental state when you are in this \"mindless consumption\" mode and learn to identify it. Develop a habit to notice when this happens and then stop and ask yourself what are you chasing, after all. Try to pause at the content you're currently reading and read it till the end once you calm down. It also helps to find books that keep your brain active while being engaging to you. I've had a lifelong passion for linguistics and I found myself digging into language philosophy, for example. This is the kind of literature that keeps me engaged, but forces me to slow down as well to think and properly process what I've read. Your mileage may vary; we are different people and definitely you have different interests than me. While I'm not a fantasy fan, I'd be a little wary of picking up fantasy books. My observations tell that the most successful ones read like action movies or first-person video games, and fast-paced action is something you want to steer away from for the purpose of this exercise. Pick up something that challenges you a bit, but is still comprehensible with the context you have right now. reply",

Essentially, if the agent gets even slightly off the path I want it on, I need to just do it myself. I give up on trying to prompt my out of a mistake it made. You get stuck thinking “one more prompt/round and it will fix the problem and everything will be perfect”, then you find yourself 4+ rounds in with the agent flip-flopping between 2 things it’s already tried. reply",

Curious how does your team make sure a Slack decision doesn’t die before it reaches Jira? Any workflow tricks that actually stick? P.S.

          "text": "Thanks for the links—Brooks and Zawinski are exactly the guard-rails we keep taped to the monitor. No Silver Bullet: We’re not chasing a “one tool to rule them all.” The essential complexity—humans aligning on what to do can’t be deleted; we’re only trying to strip away the accidental part (manual copy-pasting). Zawinski’s Law: Instead of cramming every feature into one bloated app, we’re limiting scope to a single object model: A message, a task, and a doc are the same object, just rendered in different views. Chat ≠ Task Manager ≠ Wiki, but they sit on the same data layer, so hand-offs happen automatically rather than by re-typing. Anything beyond that (CRM, billing, email) stays as integrations no temptation to rebuild an Outlook clone. So the direction is “context cohesion without feature creep.” If we can kill the copy-paste tax and still keep each tool honest to its purpose, we think that’s the sweet spot.

Think of it like version control: Git doesn’t write code for you, but it removes enough coordination pain that good engineers ship more often. We’re aiming for the same effect between conversation and execution—same motivation, less drag. From our side, the north-star is a radically simple answer: let a single chat thread end all that visible complexity. One place, one flow, nothing to copy or sync. That’s the product we’re building toward. Curious have you seen lightweight workflows that actually cut this friction without adding new layers? reply",

Melting the mud in an electric arc furnace using a plasma containing 10% hydrogen reduces it to liquid iron and liquid oxides, allowing the iron to be easily extracted. The plasma reduction technique takes 10 minutes and produces iron so pure, say the researchers, it can be processed directly into steel. And the no-longer-corrosive metal oxides solidify on cooling, so they can be transformed into glass-like material that could be used as a filling material in the construction industry. ... \"New stainless steel pulls green hydrogen directly out of seawater\" https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43991630 reply",

But mostly I find out interesting stuff from https://marginalrevolution.com/ (which usually have links to FT, Bloomberg, WP, WSJ, etc.) I was once a New Yorker subscriber, but I no longer have patience for long form writing. I also once had subscriptions to the Montreal Gazette and Globe and Mail, which were pretty good for local and domestic news respectively (but only if you're Canadian). I also once subscribed to the Walrus when Jonathan Kay was editor, but it was too boring (it's Canadian, I'm Canadian, but I don't relate to anything they write about -- but I think they've gotten more interesting since). The Economist -- I'm torn. A lot of the writing sounds smart, but many of the articles are written by young Oxbridge PPE grads who can turn a phrase but don't have a lot of real world experience. The Economist seems to be read by people who want to seem smart, who want to hold an elite-certified opinion, but don't seem to want to to do the work to actually go deep on topics and would rather outsource their opinion formation to the Economist. I also once had a subscription to Foreign Affairs. Excellent long-form articles that I no longer have any patience for. You do get the occasional long form article that is so relevant and engaging that you're forced to read it to the end, but these are few and far between. I've gone back to reading books. reply",

          "text": "I'm terrible at selling stuff, in fact I quite hate it. But this request is so unexpected that I feel I can at least give it a try. A. The design for the print editions ( https://jacobin.com/issue/speculation ). It's distinctive, carefully laid-out content with smartly used negative space, uses fresh and modern colour palettes, bold typography, moving away from the “Courier New typeface”. (For font nerds, Courier was designed in the mid-50s as a typewriter face for IBM [0] and has been adopted by many publishers because it was considered cool and was in the public domain.) For visuals, Reimecke Forbes' fresh style and creative direction is clearly a winner: the editorial illustrations are beautiful and artistic, as are the rich and playful infographics and data visualisations, many created via freelance art commissions. In fact, the magazine owes much of its success to the design of its print editions; as this article states, \"It’s the single most gorgeous and visually clever magazine currently being published in print\" [1]. It's argued that creating a beautiful object is essential to the magazine's business model, which centrally relies on a small base of premium subscribers [2] and because the majority of its content is available for free [3]. I quite like website as well. It's making full use of the space, the choice of colours is to my taste (bar the intense red in the footer navigation menu), and the content is smartly structured on the page for the various site sections, such as the author [4] and taxonomy pages [5]. B. The magazine's social and political analyses Whilst US readers are their main audience, they do look at global events and often address political and social issues and challenges on a country basis. Depending on where you're based, there's a good chance that you'll find something of (political) interest. One may not necessarily share the left perspectives for whatever reasons, but the quality of the writing is rather good and they don't mess around with their analyses: for the most part they are rigorous, historically grounded critiques of neoliberalism [6] and current events, little to no populist fluff or shallow takes, and employing clarity of language. They write a lot about democracy and its processes, wealth inequality, the power of mass protest, environmentalism, healthcare, collective action/unions, economics, politics, the BS of philanthropy [7], and building societies that work for all, not just for the rich. The magazine is considered to be the most relevant and important publication of the American political left today – \"timely, globally oriented, and topically eclectic\" [1]. Described by the Nieman Journalism Lab as a journal of \"democratic socialist thought\" [2], the magazine is involved with projects beyond publishing analytical essays, for example coordinating a nonfiction series via Verso Books. The shared commitment of the founder and the co-editors to advancing a critique of liberalism that is free of obscurantist academic theory or “cheap hooks” also matters [8]. People like Chomsky recommend it (\"a bright light in dark times\") [9] and professor Corey Robin says [1] in Vox Mag that \"it’s completely in-your-face in its style and tone; it has this name, Jacobin, that just seems designed to push people’s buttons.” The article goes on to say that \"Jacobin isn’t a traditional journalistic outfit, and purposely so. Seth Ackerman, one of the magazine’s earliest contributors, says he and Sunkara (the founder) wanted to explicitly avoid what the latter called 'rosy reports from the front'.\" Sunkara's approach is \"put your ideas out there, write as clearly as possible, and let it be challenged,\" which I quite like. The editorial standards are commendable, in my opinion: there's no clickbait, no \"both sides\" nonsense when holding power to account. One can certainly disagree with many of the things written in it, but it would be hard to deny that its content is intellectually stimulating and informative, often providing a fresh view over the political situation in the US, Europe, and Latin America, as well as plenty of historical context that helps the general public understand how we got here and perhaps offer some lessons from the past.

          "text": "D. Readership Jacobin is genuinely independent, as all quality mags should be – primarily funded by readers and subscriptions. They understand the demand for journalism and long-form content for a left (and beyond) audience, and constantly deliver on that. According to their site [10], the magazine has around 75k subscribers (and 3M online visitors), which I think I read in one of the sources quoteed below that it outperforms nearly all explicitly left-wing print publications (think Dissent, The Nation, and The Baffler), and whilst not exactly mass-market, they qualify for top-tier among political journals. It should be said that it's uncommon for explicitly left media to reach this scale without corporate ads or institutional backing. I argue that it punches above its weight in terms of digital reach, syndication, and influence in academia and activist circles, but I don't yet have the data to back this conclusion up (mainly because it would take time to obtain it and I'm lazy). It may be small in absolute terms, but that in terms of influence per capita it's likely rather significant. If you spend a bit of time digging through its content (assuming your interests are aligned with theirs), it becomes obvious why. It's also surprisingly well-connected with policymakers around the world [1], and count among their clients the New Left Review and university presses like Duke and Stanford. E. Popularity and whatnot A few major media platforms have mentioned them in their shows, articles, news, and bulletins. MSNBC [12], NYT [8], the conservative National Review [14], Politico [15], Tablet Magazine [16], New Left Review [17], The Guardian [18], The New Yorker [19], CJR [3], and more. In addition to their staff, it's likely that some or most important left thinkers alive who can write in English and are active have contributed to the magazine. Notable contributors include Nathan J. Robinson (of Current Affairs), Cory Doctorow, Hilary Wainwright (of Red Pepper mag), Sohrab Ahmari (of Compact Magazine), Slavoj Žižek, normative political theorist Bernard Harcourt, basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bernie Sanders, the former vice president of Bolivia, Álvaro García Linera, the French author and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, Annie Ernaux, the West Papuan independence leader, Benny Wenda, the co-founder of the independent publisher OR Books, Colin Robinson, the former president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, and a host of authors, journalists, researchers, sociologists, historians, political scientists, economists, philosophers, lecturers, union leaders, organisers, workers, and more. It is really a pleasure to read many of these, everything considered [20]. To me, and many like me who want to see a more equitable and fair world - one that we should exert more democratic political control over - Jacobin is a much-needed source of information and investigation that holds power to account and translates boring but important social, economic, and political research into plain English. A just and sustainable reality of our own making should not just include the views of the left; it should encourage it to participate meaningfully in politics and help temper the right-wing extremism [21] that has been taking over the US, Europe, and much of the world over the last 40 years. In the end, what we need is a society that addresses the needs of individuals, communities, and the environment - not just market outcomes or abstract freedoms, which are merely instruments or limited goals within a larger context. Whether the magazine will maintain its ethos remains to be seen; I'm prepared for disappointment, but I also recognise that it's just a medium at the end of the day. What matters to me is what's being said there, and I try not to become too attached to the magazine itself. To those quick to demonise or reflexively dismiss the left's approach to politics, philosophy, social issues, and everything else, I would say there are strong arguments not to do that, especially if you value democracy. Most scholars, policymakers, organisers, economists, and researchers on the left advocate solutions that expand wellbeing across lines of class, geography, and identity. That should not just be acceptable, it should be taken seriously, pondered, and investigated. Otherwise, I'm afraid we're running out of options as a society. If the peaceful, honest, solution-focused approach is rejected, what the masses are left with is violence.

I’ll probably let WashPo lapse; not sure it’s providing anything more than WSJ is at the moment for me. Others I’ve subscribed to: FT — it was good, slightly slower news than WSJ but faster than The Economist. Spectator — right wing trash but exceptionally well-written — if you want to know what the mean-spirited right are feeling on any issue, this will tell you. Foreign Policy — great analysis but honestly felt like news that was too slow. reply",

They know the plot threads, the characters, themes, the possible twists to watch for. This is similar to any TV series or cinematic universe. (e.g. Superheros, Tolkien-style fantasy etc) The themes change over time, but in a gradual, controlled manner. And (nearly) all perspectives point at the latest. Specialist news sources are sometimes high quality. For example: Quanta magazine, which articles we see frequently here. Ground news is an aggregator that tries to balance out the Left/Right bias of news outlets, but I think this misses the point. reply",

Plus, in the UK, the default conservative paper, The Telegraph, seems to be tabloidising and click-bait-ising itself at breakneck pace.

          "text": "What have people been doing? I work at a public HPC center and we cannot compete with industry so we cannot afford to hire anyone with experience nor can we afford to hire anyone with an amazing academic track record. So we hire juniors with 0 YOE and a sketchy CV and we give them 6 months where their main goal is to learn the craft. And it honestly works amazing well. I don't know why industry is so focused on hiring only seniors because there's lots of good talent out there that could be had for much cheaper. When we interview we don't try to assess how much technical knowledge the candidate has, but rather, of the things which they have gained experience in (and they are allowed to dictate this), how much can they confidently relay to us. From this we can estimate how much talent the candidate has. We get some interviewees with seemingly strong CVs e.g. particle physics PhD who does Kaggle in their free time, but then they are not able to explain in detail anything they have done. We also get some interviewees who have seemingly mediocre CVs e.g. bad grades, didn't publish their thesis and bare github, but they turn out amazing. I guess my point is, experience is not talent, and some good talent does not sell themselves well and for the rest you get inundated with mediocre talent who know how to sell themselves. reply",

Here is how we do it: * Our corporate recruiters are picky and yet hyper aggressive about finding/reaching people that seem qualified. It’s how they found me. I am not sure what their process is for finding people. * Next they send me the resumes that pass their filter to see if I am willing to interview them. I am generally willing to interview anyone. * The interview with me is a filter. I see if the candidate is qualified based upon experience alone. I do not bother with technical questions unless I am trying to see if they lied in their resume. So many people lie on their resume. Instead I mostly dive into their problem solving ability, their interpretation of technology, and general communication capabilities. You only need three things to be good at software: writing skills, an understanding of the platform/syntax, and people skills. * The next interview is more technical and determines if the candidate is hired. As a background I work for a defense contractor. People tend to skew much older, more experienced, and more mature. The work tends to be more predictable and polished compared to my prior software career writing JavaScript. People are expected to exercise initiative and figure things out instead hoping something like React, jquery, or AI will save their job. These sorts of pretenders are the people I try to filter out. I know I wouldn’t go back to that world where most people are under qualified and hyper insecure. I suspect that’s why people in this line of work tend to be older and why people tend to seek this work out when they could make more elsewhere. reply",

You need at least 3 weeks to go through this in a sane manner - You need to know about tons of topics (distributed systems, concurrency, microservices, k8s, ci/cd, databases, OS, networking). It’s common for engineers to know a little bit about everything, but when asked about something in particular in an interview, you cannot expect deep knowledge - good luck trying to convince them that it doesn’t matter if you don’t have professional experience in $language, that you are rather an agnostic software engineer with experience in different progr languages and frameworks - if you don’t craft your cv with proper buzzwords, you won’t get a chance to get interviewed. The ones who read your cv first are: machines (that are inflexible) and hr recruiters that know nothing about tech besides buzzwords - good luck making a single mistake in the tech interview. Since the company has 100s of other candidates, they are only looking for the best of the best Honestly, I don’t know whats wrong  with using ai to “prepare” for interviews.

          "text": "First to me, hiring from a job posting's crop of CVs is going at it the hard way: of course you get 100s of responses. If you have alternatives available: network, recruiter, user groups, trade show, anything really, then use that at least in addition to random CVs (which then are backup). Second, I would suggest rounding up a few colleagues who can spend 20 seconds per CV. If 100s of these CVs all look basically the same - roughly impossible to judge a fit - then all these have failed already. Hopefully you are left with more interesting looking CVs which appear to actually say something (beyond keyword slop). A resume has one job. It shouldn't take deep reading to set aside 90% of them. Which leads us to resume intake software. I understand why HR depts use resume intake software - they don't have the competence to read them. But normally the technical team does have the competence - and should be able to tell quickly keyword slop from not keyword slop. (AI will mess that up - but I don't think we are there yet.) Some of the common resume formats out there fail us all 100%. They are not useful anymore. I appreciate candidates who notice what the resume is there for. reply",

          "text": "Been there, done that and I don't have an answer. For around 4 years I was a de facto consultant on paper(LLC-equivalent + invoicing) but the truth is, it was just a remote role for a foreign company, nothing to do with building something for myself. In all fairness, I've started building stuff on my own countless times over the years. In fact that dates back to when I was in my early teenage years, meaning over two decades ago. At the time, there was some merit to it but I lacked the knowledge and experience. At this point, software and the functions that are expected from it are not a single-person task. Example: I cannot do UI to save my life. There are also tasks which are incredibly tedious and time consuming, which is a can I keep kicking down the road whenever I get to that part. Hypothetically you could try to look for a partner in crime, which I also have. In my experience, everyone simply loses interest sooner rather than later. You keep pushing hard for another month or two, hoping they'd get into it but ultimately it is I who get's fed up and never brings it up again. If only I could count the times me and one or two other people have started something in which we saw potential and then shove it in the back of a storage unit, only to see an identical product pop up 2 years later and explode. To give you an example: back in 2018 me and two other people started working on an video conferencing tool specifically designed for education with all sorts of wild things integrated into it, from math and literature, all the way to music classes and art. It scaled incredibly well, it was incredibly cheap to run but it was a prototype at this point. Then, just like all other instances I eventually got fed up when I ended up spending countless sleepless nights while having a full time job and did a flip table. And as you can imagine, 2 years later, COVID, everyone go home, classes go online. Which brings me to a second point - I'm never happy when something I'm working on is completely half-assed - many people are not shy to present a semi-working product and figure out the rest along the way. In fact I've been working in such companies for much of my life. But if I were to do it myself, I'd never be comfortable promoting something, knowing exactly how bad it really is. In a nutshell - not everyone is made for that and also you need to be at the right place and the right time with the right people. Some people call it luck, I see it just as a function of entropy. reply",

          "text": "Working for wages doesn't have to mean 9-5 in an office. Many programmers work remotely with flexible hours. Most places I've worked had flexible hours and in-office requirements even before COVID. Self-employment can mean selling time and expertise in the form of freelancing. Or it can mean building products you sell. It can lead to a combination of both -- building products and then selling time/expertise to customers. The biggest SAAS companies (think Oracle, Salesforce, etc.) make considerable revenue from services along with licensing their software. I freelanced for a long time, selling expertise sometimes (not always) measured in time spent. A lot of successful freelancers bill in terms of deliverables, or on regular retainers, rather than charging per hour like a salaried job. The main value derived from working for an employer, especially early in a career, comes from developing a professional network and accumulating business domain expertise. Building software to sell frequently fails because of poor understanding of the target business domain, which gets wrongly interpreted as a marketing problem. Businesses don't need software or code in the abstract -- they need and pay for solutions to business problems, something that adds value, decreases costs, improved efficiency, yields competitive advantage. reply",

I initially bought the pebble keyboard as I had bought two replacement keyboards for my old T450 and the spacebar did not work on either one, even though i got them from two different outlets. cost £50 for the two keyboards. The pebble keyboard sits nicely on top of the failed keyboard and works perfectly for my needs. I then bought the pebble mouse to complement the keyboard. What I found great about them is that they can be set up to work on three different devices, They both have three settings for three different devices, I use one for my gaming/pentesting rig, one for my media server and one for my old T450. no more clunky wired gaming keyboards or mice and no more tedious wireless keyboards or mice with batteries running out or simple failing after a year.

This can be a lot more efficient than looking in incomplete or badly organized manuals (MUI, react-router, ...) or filtering out the wrong answers on Stack Overflow that Stack Overflow doesn't filter out.

          "text": "God this comment reads exactly like someone asked gemini to make a classic hacker news comment reply to this post. Slightly useful insight, that perfectly transition into an ad for the commenter’s startup.\n Actually, I asked o3 for a response to the OP and here’s what it generated. “Using AI for code has reminded me of this sensation… switching in and out of “driving” feels more exhausting than being 100 % one or the other.”\nYou’re not imagining it. There’s a fair bit of cognitive-science literature on task-set inertia: every time you hand work off (human→AI or AI→human) you pay ~100–150 ms to reconstruct the mental model, plus an exponentially-longer “resumption lag” if the state is ambiguous.¹ Do that dozens of times per hour and you’ve effectively added a stealth meeting to your day.\nA few things that helped me when pairing with an LLM: • Chunk bigger. Treat the AI like a junior dev on 30-minute sprint tickets, not a rubber duck you ping every two lines. • Use “state headers.” I prepend a tiny recap in comments — // you own: parse(), I own: validate() — so I can scan and re-hydrate context instantly. • Declare no-AI zones. Sounds counter-intuitive, but reserving, say, test-writing for uninterrupted solo focus keeps me in flow longer overall.\n…have you tried anything successfully to address it?\nWe were annoyed enough to build something. At Recontext (YC S24) we sit between your editor and whatever LLM you’re using; every AI request is automatically tagged with the diff, dependency graph, and TODO items so when you jump back in, you get a one-glance briefing instead of spelunking through scrollback. Early users report ~40 % fewer context switches during a coding session. If anyone wants to kick the tires, we’re handing out private beta invites — email is in profile.\n⸻\n¹ See Monsell, “Task switching,” Trends in Cognitive Sciences 2003 — the “switch cost” math is sobering. reply",

You've given a name to the pain: 'task-set inertia' and the cost of the 'stealth meeting.' Painfully accurate. The advice here is gold, especially treating the AI like a 'junior dev' on a 30-min ticket vs. a 'rubber duck' you ping every two lines. That really crystallizes the right mental model. Very cool that you're tackling this head-on with Recontexter. Solving the 're-hydrating context' problem is such a critical challenge. I'll be following your work. reply",

However when native UIs were prevalent, there were standards built up over years of hard-earned experience: for a Windows app, you wanted to get your tab order right, and you knew the convention of getting the Cancel button mapped to the escape key etc etc. See also the Mac and the HIG, encouraging apps to look and work roughly the same. There were always outliers and ugly UIs, but it always felt like there was a uniformity that made it easier to get around in an unfamiliar app. Whereas now, electron apps look and work very differently (comparing slack to Spotify to VSCode and so on). That said, I think very few people care as much as I do about it, and cross-platform UIs save a ton of development work. reply",

So while I used to agree with you re: usability, these days I'm not so sure anymore. One idle thought I had: when computer interfaces were still new, using physical analogies like file cabinets was good practice for teaching new users. Maybe GUIs are now commonplace enough that people are able to speak the different \"languages\" without as much trouble. reply",

On a traditional native UI you’d always have a menu bar, you’d always have a File and Edit menu. These days you may have a hamburger menu but it also may just be a wrapper for a menu bar. It’s just all a bit……vague I suppose. Tbh it doesn’t matter really. As I implied in the previous comment, I can’t imagine many people bemoan the fact they can’t press Alt-f to get an illustrative menu drop-down, even if I do. reply",
