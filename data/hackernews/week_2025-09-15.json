Burnout isn’t a flaw in your ability, it’s often the cost of high ownership in broken systems. Stepping away without notice sounds like survival, not weakness. On your questions:\nI believe portfolios matter less than signal. A solid GitHub readme, a tiny demo with personality, or even a clean writeup can open doors. Hiring today is noisy, clarity stands out more than size. AI hype is mostly wrappers + vibes. But that's a feature. If you can ship small, real tools that feel smart, you’re ahead. Nobody’s expecting you to train models. On staying engaged: what helped me was shipping for insight, not polish. Projects as questions, not proof. The goal isn’t “a finished app,” it’s “what did I just learn about what I love, hate, or want to do more of?” You clearly still care about the craft, about growth. That’s the rarest signal of all.

          "text": "I'm glad you made the commitment to change something in your life. Your previous job, and perhaps the way you approached it, was obviously not healthy. 1) The degree anxiety is understandable, but just in your head. I run a comp sci program for high schoolers as an replacement for universities. They don't get a degree but must learn how to signal they are capable. It's a skillset that most people don't learn until later in their careers. In your case, you likely have accumulated a number of valuable skills in your previous job. Since you haven't switched jobs, you haven't had much practice in communicating your skills to potential employers. Most engineers I know hate this, but it's sales/persuasion, and it's unavoidable and beneficial for you in the long-run. Take the perspective that you don't have a skill issue, but a signaling issue. 2) RE: AI - I would learn the fundamentals, only if you're interested in the engineering aspect of it, and implement some toy projects just to keep learning.  Try vibe coding, it's not going to kill you haha. Learn about its benefits and limitations so you can at least comment intelligently if it comes up. 3) Shipping projects is hard psychologically unless you've developed discipline or there are other constraints/deadlines. If I were you, I'd work on projects in a more social manner. That means building with other engineers, talking to people who would benefit from what you're building, or just helping out existing communities. The socialization would help keep your spirits up. It's also the best way to build relationships and open other opportunities. 4) Hiring/recruiting is going through big changes now, partially due to the rise of AI generated applications. Building trust via other channels is going to be much more important moving forward. We've had to more or less turn off all inbound hiring and rely on our vetted professional networks due to the massive glut of applications. Job search is brutal now, but it's just as bad on the hiring side. We're going through changes were the old methods don't work anymore, and the new haven't been figured out yet. Good luck! reply",

A degree isn't a finite indicator of a person's knowledge, capability, or achievements. 39 months after getting mine, I still haven't landed my first paid tech job to enter the industry, and I don't see that happening anytime soon, if ever. Granted, I haven't tried much in the past year, but it wasn't any better when I did. I once rejected the notion outright because, with obvious bias as a college student, I felt it invalidated everything I'd worked toward. But it's become apparent my degree meant nothing in the industry. On the contrary, you got a job and remained employed for 11 years. That piece of paper, or the lack thereof, didn't make a difference in what you experienced and accomplished. > I'm suffering from a lot of analysis paralysis trying to select a side project for a portfolio. How do you keep yourselves engaged with pet projects? My github is a field of projects 1/4 of the way completed before I lost steam on them. Personally I... don't. I started one of my projects back in August 2024. I made a homepage, UI, and a basic database schema... and then I blanked out on how to progress and hardly touched it for 11 months. I got some wind in my sails again in July - almost a full year later. A whole year of new experiences and insights, inside and out of the tech domain, led to better practices and features never conceived the first time around. So even if you're not coding or even looking at your project, who's to say you're not progressing with it? I read of this phenomenon in innovation called the S-curve, where advancements appear to occur rapidly in a short time due to a change in tech, paradigm, or process. Perhaps the next burst of progress simply requires time to find and cultivate through many seemingly insignificant insights gained from other experiences. No point in rushing through - if I'm not working on it, it's not the right time. That's also why I have like a billion (okay, more like 3-5) projects going. I hit a brick wall on one, so I work on something else where I have a clearer vision. Eventually, something triggers a flash of inspiration, and with a fresh mind, I can return and hit that burst of progress in the S-curve again. Eventually, I'll have many projects with lots of progress due to the staggered curves. Conceptualizing a whole project is daunting, too. Too many bells and whistles lead to a paralyzing spiral of overthinking and self-doubt. Everything has to be perfect and fleshed out. But the mantra of \"done is better than perfect\" rings true. Once there's a solid foundation, it's much easier to incrementally improve the project, rather than trying to get it right in one go, and eventually reach what was envisioned. I find it important to remember why I started a project in the first place. With my own imposter syndrome, I always gravitated toward doing what was considered best practices to be a \"real software engineer.\" I could never do right by myself, so I overcomplicated the tech stack and implementations to hell, following the words of others, trying to prove myself. If it wasn't complex and grueling, I wasn't doing anything worthwhile. However, I eventually reminded myself that the code is the least important part of my software project. I never started a project to have code, but to address a personally close issue or fulfill an itch. If the project addresses that goal, then why does it matter if the load times aren't perfectly optimized? Why does it matter if it doesn't scale to millions of users when I haven't even gotten 1 yet? Who cares if it's not \"impressive\" enough to hypothetical people I've never seen? Implementation has its considerations, but shouldn't be to the point of blocking all progress. Certainly not to where working on the project isn't fulfilling anymore. So, sometimes, after a long paralysis, I yell at myself mentally to, quote, \"Just freakin' do it already, for the love of everything holy, just write the fudging thing- [insert more aggressive self-yelling]\" , overriding my thoughts to do without that pesky thinking. But yeah, those are my accounts with those challenges. Good luck wherever the future takes you! reply",

You have to be impressive enough for a callback, then a possible tech screen where you write code in coderpad or something, then some combination of coding, behavioral, and architectural interviews almost always done virtually. lots of people practice on leetcode, I recommend everyone at least practice the common easier questions and solving them quickly.  The medium and hard ones are worth the investment if you're going for big tech, but maybe less important for startups that all have their own style of interviews (that vary quite a bit). Startups and no name medium sized companies can be random.  Some have collaborative coding, some copy big tech, some just talk to you, some look at portfolio projects or give take home assignments, anything and everything here. > How important is it to have a visable portfolio of working projects? Much less important than having recognizable names on the resume, and also less important than having contributions to known Open Source projects. I highly recommend putting time into existing well known projects (Apache, anything done from Meta/facebook/Google etc), and trying to get a PR accepted, than hacking away on your own project. Every senior in college has an extensive portfolio of projects on their github, it's very hard to tell how much was copied or how good it is. A much better signal is someone who can deal with the intricacies of an existing gargantuan codebase, go back and forth in PR comments, follow a style guide, work with maintainers, take criticism, have clear communication, and see something through (That may take a while!). > How much of the AI hype is HN nerds nerding out about AI versus actually implementing AI, versus gluing AI apis together? Eh, for me, AI has been amazing at teaching me a new PL, and porting small bits of code. It's been helpful for writing unit tests, getting scaffolding going, etc. but sometimes incomplete. It's been on rare occasions able to solve a bug for me. that's about it.  YMMV. Source - no degree, senior engineer at Google.  Also spent 10+ years working at shit companies and doing open source before getting a chance at bigger more well known companies, then doing that for ~8 until I could work my way into getting FAANG interviews. reply",

My last job was as a contract research engineer doing AI safety work at Redwood Research. I spent about half my time on our synthetic datasets of safe & unsafe LLM behavior, and the other half on fancy finetuning. I finetuned an LLM to exhibit unsafe behavior while fooling logistic probes trained to detect it, but only in deployment. Weird multi-part composite loss. My other big project is independent research in text-to-image models that are trained solely on unlabeled image data, exploiting CLIP embeddings for the link between text and images. Currently fighting with spherical flow matching models and racing the ICLR paper deadline. If you need help getting ML systems up and running, getting them fast and correct, or if any of that stuff sounds interesting to you, get in touch. reply",

I do well with detail-oriented work. I have 14.7k reputation on StackOverflow and have answered over 300 questions there, mostly on .NET-related topics. (The link to my SO profile is on my CV.) I'm looking for a senior full stack or senior backend role. I was unable to work following issues during the pandemic, which are now resolved, but I'm rarely getting to talk with anyone to be considered for interviews; AI rejects my CV outright. I'm stuck in an algorithmic prison. Despite the length of break, my knowledge is current. If you need convincing of that, I recently got through the whole interview process at Moneybox for a senior backend role, which is pretty much the only interview I've had. Although they hired someone else, they spent a week trying to allocate extra budget to hire me. Unfortunately, that didn't happen, and so here I am. If you aren't hiring, but know someone who is, I'd appreciate you sharing my details with them. I can start straight away. If anyone has any advice to help break out of the AI auto rejections, I'd also appreciate it if you'd contact me via email. Thanks for reading. reply",

It would be amazing to have some device similar to classig Palm Pilot, \"handheld PDA\". Maybe even with stylus, 4\"-5\" touchscreen that easily fits anywhere. Are there any similar devices available? Tablets are way too large and are using same closed mobile ecosystems.</div>",

It won't be near as smooth as PalmOS, but if you're into hacking a little bit, it might be worth looking at. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPQ2q7yVjZs I've seen some other people hack together similarly devices. One was a Raspberry Pi 0 with a blackberry keyboard and a screen. Anything off the shelf and even remotely polished these days is likely running Android, which seems like it would defeat the purpose. The are Remarkable Move might be an option, if you're looking more for a notebook to organize everything, but if you want a Palm-like experience, that will also miss the mark. You could try for an old Palm or Handspring device off eBay. It might be its own island, or getting in syncing could be a project. You can run old Palm ROMS on smartphones. I tried it, but once the nostalgia wore off in 5 minutes I gave up on it. It also seems to defeat the purpose of what you're going for. reply",

For server-hosted: mostly just security bugs and working around phone cache. > reliability and predictability For phone-hosted: you'll never have all your data, you are constantly dependant on apps tradeoffs or outright availability (even my train schedule app stopped supporting my phone OS, amazing), phone theft or broken or other loss. For server-hosted: All your data, apps you control, always able to write your own additional tool and deploy whenever you want, reliable backups, against rare no network access. >  wanting to avoid setting up accounts For phone-hosted: Indeed more and more difficult to deploy your own apps (because accounts and hoops to jump). For server-hosted: what accounts? My server my accounts. You rarely need something like an additional remote server (which even then would be less constrained than a phone developer account - and probably cheaper.) > space (you didn't mention this one) Server-hosted is much cheaper space than on the phone (at the tradeoff of transfer speed). > development hurdles (you didn't mention this one) Gone! Free as the wind! Whatever tool, whatever \"pratices\", no gatekeepers, update when you want either standard software or your own - or postpone updates when the situation demands. Absurdly simpler development. All yours. So anyway, my point is that the original attractiveness of hosting a private-data personal app on the phone has changed. (1) that has been made harder - and less private, while (2) access of your home server has become MUCH better. reply",

Komodo Health is fixing that—with data. We’ve mapped the patient journey across the country to build the most complete picture of disease burden and treatment gaps. Our customers are pharma, payers, and health systems who actually want to do something meaningful with that information. We have an exciting product, marmot, that is AI-native, both in the interface as well as in development, and want to carefully grow high productivity teams around this offering. AI integrated with Komodo's data is giving some of the most unique, real world insights any of us has seen come out of the new LLM era. Our product was just featured on Times Sqaure too! https://www.linkedin.com/posts/komodo-health_last-week-our-d... We are looking for highly independent individuals, who can work in a new, small, but empowered team. What will you be bringing? - Proven experience working on Agentic systems that solve real problems OR Some evidence you have the \"instinct\" Andrew Ng mentions as the differentiators of successful Agent builders. We also take full ownership of the product, so experience+readiness for fullstack development is a must. Core ML experience is not required and for this position, not relevant at all. The new LLM/Agent era is... different. Perks will include annual conference trip, periodic travel to SF/NY for on-site, Executive Coaching, etc. If this post sounds exciting, please apply at https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/komodohealth/jobs/806961600... (mention HN as the source). Please note, we can only consider applicants who are already in the US. If you wish, please also email me at ramraj.velmurugan@komodohealth.com with an example of how you have figured out that instinct I mention above.",

If you also get a bunch of data breach mailers in your mail box every year, you're familiar with the impact of security breaches at tech companies. We're trying to put a stop to that by helping companies understand their risk and mitigate it. HQ is in Ann Arbor, MI, but we're all over the US. We're looking for a Senior SRE to help improve reliability and developer experience, and a Staff Software Engineer to join our Attack Surface Management product team. If you're a little bit more senior or junior than either of the postings, please do still apply. We care a lot more about getting the right people than we do matching the level exactly to the posting. Please please apply to these role if: - You can take ownership of improving a part of the product (Staff SWE) or the application platform we build for product engineers (SRE). - You're game to navigate the messy middle of a small, nimble company with really high customer expectations. You'll have to navigate some ambiguity to be successful in either of these roles - don't expect pristine PRDs coming down from on high.

Our primary cloud is in GCP and we also maintain our own physical servers (prior experience with physical hardware is great, but not required).

          "text": "Y Combinator (yes, the people who run this site) | Full stack web and AI | San Francisco | Onsite | Fulltime YC itself hires software engineers from time to time.  Many people don't know that YC has a small but very important software team.  We run several websites - not just this one, but also workatastartup.com (the main way YC companies hire), a social network for YC founders, and the core infrastructure that YC itself runs on. Recently, we've been spending most of our time building our own AI agents.  Over the last year, YC has mostly funded AI agent companies, so it's been cool to go really deep building our own AI agents too.  We're building agents to automate every aspect of what we do, and pushing the limits of what's possible with the current models to do it. An unusual aspect of being on the YC software team is that you'll get full access to the YC program, founders and partners.  The YC batch runs in the same building we work out of, so there are talks with famous founders happening most nights, right downstairs in our building.  If you want to start a startup someday, working at YC would be an excellent jumping off point - several YC companies have come from team members who decided to start their own company. YC works fully in-person in SF. We're happy to help you move here if you're in the US already.  Unfortunately we can't sponsor new visas, but we're happy to transfer existing ones. YC offers highly competitive compensation and benefits. You can apply online ( https://www.ycombinator.com/careers ) or just email me at jared@ycombinator.com reply",

What: We’re building an autonomous maritime network — think distributed systems in the ocean—extending resilient comms, sensing and compute to the edge in high-threat remote environments. Who we are looking for: - Software Engineers: large-scale distributed systems, networking, system design, embedded software, DevOps rollouts. Python, C++, Rust. Bonus: SDR, mesh, security. - Electrical Engineers: PCB layout, embedded, RF, circuits, power/batteries, electro-mechanical. Bonus: DSP. - Marine/Mechanical Engineers: pressure vessels, subsea robotics, gliders, ruggedized design; DFM, reliability, field deployment. You will: ship code to robots, test on the water, move fast, own big surface area, and work directly with military operators. About Us: Our founding team includes a Navy SEAL veteran, defense industry engineers, builders, hackers, and watermen (sailors, boaters, divers, fishermen). We’re focused on real future missions — not legacy requirements. Venture-backed; public launch soon. Eligibility for a TS/SCI security clearance is a plus.

Our primary strength is functioning as a data marketplace where we differentiate ourselves by automatically standardizing data, \nmaking platform data accessible through the Narrative Query Language (NQL), \ngiving data providers the ability to define row-level access and pricing policies, \nand making it easy to deliver data to a variety of destinations using our \"Connector Framework\". We operate two flavours of our platform: An AWS-based implementation that runs on our infrastructure, \nand a Snowflake-based version running inside the user's Snowflake account. We are a small, remote-first team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch. \nWhile the company's headquarters are in NYC, the development team currently includes engineers working from the US (California and New York), \nCanada (Alberta, British Columbia, and Québec), Poland, and Serbia. In brief, the technologies we use are: - Backend: Scala, Spark, Apache Iceberg, Apache Calcite, Cats, Cats-Effect, Http4s, FS2, Doobie, Deequ, Axolotl, BentoML, and HuggingFace Transformers. - Frontend: Typescript, VueJS, Nuxt, Vite, and Cloudflare Pages. - Operations: AWS (ECR, ECS, EMR, RDS, S3, etc.), Datadog, Docker, Terraform, with some burgeoning use of EKS/Kubernetes.

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Does anyone know of good resources to make your own animatronic Halloween displays?<p>I'm a software engineer, and not skilled in hardware per se.<p>I would love to make some things together with my kids. For reference, they are 8, 10, 12 and VERY smart and they use Ubuntu as their desktop computers and can use flatpak from the command line. Not that I am bragging....<p>And, I would love to NOT spent $400 on just a single ridiculous junky thing from Lowes, and do that for multiple things. My budget is definitely tiny and the journey of building and troubleshooting is what I want for the kids, not necessarily a finished perfect project.<p>I found this site and it looks interesting but I am unsure how well this would work for someone like me and whether I would be able to get it working. The site says \"Only 54 days until Halloween!\"<p>https://www.frightprops.com/pneumatics.html<p>If anyone knows of good projects on GitHub, please let me know?</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

It is largely not different than a \"custom\" setup because it's always some patched together job of various plugins to the point that it becomes brittle and difficult to work with. I get the sense that technical people think it is more straightforward and prescribe it to people, but any non-technical person I've worked with is utterly lost in it. I don't think the LLMs change the argument either. If anything, dealing with the complexities of wordpress could make it even more difficult without someone who knows what they're doing. Somewhere around 15 years ago, I thought wordpress was viable, but I think we need to leave it in the dust. I worked with it again 5 years ago, and the situation was no different from what I could tell. reply",

If you are just being an unofficial middle man between a SaaS and your customer you are going to make very little money.  Its essentially uber for tech, you are going to be bearing the burden of all the implementation friction.  On top of that you are acting as an uncommissioned sales person for the SaaS while they collect income indefinitely from your work. The difference in how you setup the deal is literally millions of dollars in the real life example I mentioned.  I don't care about corporations.  I want HN posters to make money for their work and skills rather than be used and tossed in the trash by corporations.  Guess what?  The company is still in business and doing fine.  The owner just gets one less lambo per year and a developer gets to feed their family. Its also worth mentioning the obvious only reason they still pay the small consultancy is that they are constantly asking for changes and new things.  Why would you want the extra overhead of working in someone elses sandbox when you have to do all the work anyway.  Might as well be on your terms if you are going to do the work. reply",

Currently having 20+ sites running this setup for clients and never hit an issue \"modeling\" the data as Decap config, widgets (also custom ones), can allow pretty much anything. One downside for this setup, is that uploaded media are not re-sized or compressed (since there is no backend job doing it), so a client must be briefed into \"making smaller images\" (on the web client side with squoosh.app[2] for example), or using a SSG that does that built-in (hugo, gatsby) 0. https://github.com/sveltia 1. https://decapcms.org/docs/gitlab-backend/#client-side-pkce-a... 2. https://squoosh.app reply",

A couple years later, the dev moves on, and the client has no way to update their site with new features or sections, and no way to fix it if anything breaks. And we have to explain to them what headless is and why they're in this situation. It sucks for everyone involved. Go with a regular CMS, like Wix or Squarespace or WordPress. The $10 or $20 a month is still cheaper than having to pay a dev later to fix their broken headless site with old deprecated packages and frameworks that nobody uses anymore. Headless is a developer optimization, not a client feature. It only makes sense if the dev is a part of the customer's own team, or in an ongoing agency relationship with them. It's a poor fit for freelancers and volunteers because the client ends up with essentially abandonware. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Recent [\"self-propagating NPM malware\"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45260741) reminds us that the predominant security model is basically whack-a-mole: you gotta trust _every_ piece of software you run (including all the libraries, plugins, etc), unless you explicitly sandbox it.<p>Capability-based security might offer an alternative: software should not have access to things when it's not explicitly provided with access. I.e. \"classic\" desktop security is kind of a blacklist model (everything is possible unless explicitly restricted e.g. via sandbox) while capbility-based security is like a whitelist.<p>On a programming language level it's usually known as object-capability model, and there's a number of programming languages which implement it: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model<p>The question: why isn't it more popular? It doesn't even seem to be widely known, let alone used. (Aside from isolated examples.)<p>Is there any chance it would be widely adopted?<p>I guess one objection is that people don't want to manually configure security. But perhaps it can be integrated into normal UX if we really think about it: e.g. if you select a file using a system-provided file picker it would automatically grant access to that file, as access is explicitly authorized.</p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I don't know much (if anything) about it, but it can be turned into an interesting thought experiment. Let’s use Apple as an example, as they tend to do major transitions on a regular basis. So, let’s say that the top tier already approved the new security mode(l). Now, how to do it? My understanding is that most if not all APIs would have to be changed or replaced. So that's pretty much a new OS, that needs new apps (if the APIs change, you cannot simply recompile the apps). Now, if you expose the existing APIs to the new OS/apps, then what's the gain? And if you don't expose them, then you basically need a VM. I mean, I don’t know Darwin syscalls, but I suspect you might need new syscalls as well. And so you end up with a brand new OS that lives in a VM and has no apps. So it's likely order(s?) of magnitude more profitable to just harden the existing platforms. reply",

Back in 70s and 80s computers didn't contain valuable information to care about and there was no Internet to transmit such information. So, adding some sort of security elements in operating systems had no sense. In these years modern operating system were first developed - Unix, Dos, Windows. Since then many architectural decisions of these operating systems weren't revised in order to avoid breaking backward-compatibility. Even if we need to break it to achieve better security, no one is ready to make such sacrifice. There are projects of operating systems with focus on security, which are not just Unix-like systems or Windows clones. But they can't replace existing operating systems because of network effects (it's unpractical to use a system nobody else uses). reply",

          "text": "> I am not very familiar with 'slicer' software yet. and > durable, temperature/chemical resistant materials such as PC/Nylon/ABS or infused materials. are a little cart-before-horse. This is like asking what ink-and-paper printer to buy for making complex, multi-format printed books to specific criteria, while admitting that you've not used any form of publishing software or understand any of the non-software processes involved in making a book. The slicer is by far your most important tool for _effective_ 3D printing with a variety of materials, moreso than CAD or 3D modeling. Get a cheaper, more plug-and-play printer that doesn't meet all of your criteria, and focus on learning how to effectively use its slicer. Print basic things, experiment, and force and make hands-on mistakes with it on relatively forgiving PLA/PETG. Do these _before_ jumping up to a pricier, fully enclosed machine _and also_ before printing harder-to-use materials, each of which will add new difficulties. You don't want your first hotend blob to happen on a decent machine that you actually like while using a material that's difficult or dangerous to deal with. A Sovol SV06 or SV08 meets most of your criteria at about 1/3 to 1/2 of your budget; I haven't had the best experiences with their reliability but they fit many of your criteria. Used Creality Enders might be even cheaper depending on where you are, and while also fussy are hackable and repairable to the point of often being used as platforms for entirely different printers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmMW6_7lrlQ reply",

          "text": "I agree in principle with the above comment, but for some additional context - slicer software has gotten really, really good these days. Especially (sadly) if you don't need open source software. To make a CNC machining metaphor - Slicer software is basically just your interface to the dials and knobs on the CNC settings for speeds and feeds. There's more settings, because 3d printing is more like if a CNC had a baby with a welder and an injection molding press, only it's injecting and simultaneously welding up a blob of plastic. You're balancing the toolpaths, the temps, the adhesion, and the overall speed all at the same time, all for whatever material you're using. So it's complex, but these companies have a ton of data and experience in order to make sure their preset settings are damn good out of the box. And these days, they get it right more often than they get it wrong! Long story short - you should probably just get a Bambu. You'll learn what you need to learn from it, while having good quality output the whole time. If you find out it's not suitable for what you're looking to do, then you can sell it used with decent resale and get the best printer for your specific application. reply",

Potentially a lot of work unless you're interested in 3D printing itself as a hobby rather than as a tool. Prusa Core One would be a bit more complete OOTB.  It is 220mm in the smallest axis (Y) though.  Slicer and firmware are open source, but the hardware is not (unlike previous Prusa printers). Bambu gives you the same capability for much less, but the firmware is not open source (third party open source firmware does exist).  I believe the stock firmware also has to \"phone home\" at least once before it can be used offline. Even cheaper are less-well known Chinese companies, like Qidi.  Firmware is usually a proprietary fork of Klipper or other open source projects; some people have had success flashing the mainline version. reply",

Amazon and few others have taken up on themselves to make life of their sellers easier by handling taxes for them, especially for EU, but i see no reason for it whatsoever. Businesses should be businesses and handle their own taxes and legal obligations by themselves. Additionally, if you get involved in between the seller and the buyer, YOU are now liable when it comes to taxes, as you become de-facto the seller, you have to handle returns/refunds(including the tax aspect and have to handle already paid taxes in such cases as well), audits and other legal aspects. There is simply no good reason why you should involve yourself in this whatsoever. Just facilitate the business transaction, but not the financial transaction. reply",

Most of the time the learning happens along the way, not necessarily in the solution itself but all the things you try and iterate on your journey to the solution. Everything changes in tech by the minute ... but also nothing changes. For web applications it has been HTML, CSS and JS for nearly 30 years. XMLHttpRequest/AJAX came out 25+ years ago. There have been many improvements along the way, like applying design patterns instead of cgi-bin directories with scripts that had a +x modifier on them in the file system. But the base technologies have not changed all that much. We still submit HTML form's with input fields to a back-end server that handles that data. We're still rendering HTML and using CSS to style it. Gone are custom UI toolkits like Flash or Java Applets. Maybe WASM is something to look into but it feels like its not mainstream to me. If you don't want to get left behind, learn the basic building blocks at a deep level, they don't change much. reply",

I’ve embraced that I cannot direct which topic my self-directed learning will take up and sustain (almost none of which ends up going toward tech stuff, aside from a span of some years in my teens and early 20s—and all of that was motivated by wanting to accomplish specific things with computers) and rely on assignments to motivate me for career-relevant learning. I’ll learn whatever it takes to get the job done. Then stop, because I don’t actually care about the tech per se , most of the time, and trying to force myself to learn “just because” does nothing but make me miserable and waste time. This isn’t even “how I approach learning as a generalist”, it’s how I became a generalist . My interest in continuing to fiddle with stuff after the job’s done is basically zero. My experience has been that it takes amazingly little effort to be above-median among practitioners at a lot of things. How many React developers have spent one entire hour reading through the core logic of React itself? How many people working with LLMs have read the Attention Is All You Need paper? How many people read about the disk storage layout of a database they’ve been told to use? It’s way less than half. It takes so very little to stand out. reply",

Never in my life have I made an active decision to stop learning about any one thing. You learn whatever skill is required to deal with the problem at hand and go on keep learning until you need a new skill or just get distracted. But also you're making an extremely bad mistake in your thinking here. Being a generalist does not preclude being a master. In fact, I've found that in today's market you must have specializations. Right now I'm selling myself as an electronics engineer and embedded C programmer. But my deepest expertice is C#, where I consider myself to be a fairly high level expert. My current job is writing react native with some EE on the side. You're trying to actively spread yourself even thinner which is a huge error. Knowing almost nothing about everything is not useful today, we just use AI for that. You need some real, solid skills to work from. You also need to be able to be a specialist and do specialist work because you are not likely to find a good generalist role. There aren't many such roles and they're getting harder to find. But all in all my answer is no. There is no point where you should stop learning any one thing. Follow your passions and what's interesting. Finding a subject you're interested in and spending a ton of time learning about it isn't a bad thing. That's how you figure out what you like and how you build real skills. You should follow particular subjects into mastery because a generalist without any specialization is not actually very useful unless you're a world class engineer. It's clichéd, but genuinely follow whatever subjects make you happy and find a way to make that work for you. reply",

What I'm saying is that specialization is not antithetical to generalization. A good generalist should have areas of expertise because we can't cover everything .

          "text": "TBH it's very difficult to gauge when to stop pursuing something. Personally, I learn something up until it stops becoming useful and/or it starts becoming more of a burden on my mental overhead. Doesn't mean I'm never going to go back to it, it just means I accomplished what I needed to do with the minimum amount of knowledge. From there on out it is entirely dependent on how much the topic interested me. Most of the time I'll end up going back to a topic anyways since making things isn't just about designing and creating the thing, it's also maintaining it. At that point it's more about whether or not you can pursue a project due to it's knowledge requirements, but I believe that falls out of the bounds of your question. This is my rule of thumb: Learn what you need to know first for your task at hand. If your curiosity can't be contained, make a mental note. If that mental note doesn't go anywhere and you keep dwelling on the thought of it, pursue it until your curiosity is satisfied. If done successfully, repeat. You COULD write it down, but if you're anything like me you'll just end up with a desk filled to the brim with post it notes and never actually going back to 90% of those topics. Which kills a lot of trees. If you're into that sorta thing, don't let me stop you. Making a mental note is much better since if the topic is of interest to you, then you will not forget about it. Therefore, you'll let your curiosity build up until you cannot contain yourself and have to learn more about the topic. NOTE:\nBeing a generalist usually comes because of a deep sense of curiosity in a wide range of topics. Take your time and enjoy the process of learning things since that will guarantee the longevity of your curiosity without burnout. reply",

It is good to be aware of some tech/capabilities but learning it only for the sake of learning it is a waste of time as if anything that you do not use, you forget. For example, you can learn 70% of features of a new language you are picking up and that will get you through 99% of your time. There is absolutely no need to learn the remaining 30% of the features that you'll never use. So in short, learn what you need, but be aware of the options in case you might have a use case for some of them in the future in which case you will know where to look and what to learn. reply",

Going out of my way to dive deep on something I will never use seems like a waste of time to me. My company sent me to Citrix training years ago. I was going to get certified, but didn’t end up doing it. The class and certification seem designed for someone setting up the entire Citrix infra for their company. In my role, I just made a publish app here and there, which I already knew how to do. After the training, our use of Citrix went down, and I haven’t touched it at all in 10 years. I’m glad I didn’t waste my time deep diving on technology I’d never actually use. If we use it again in the future, I’ll have to re-learn it either way, since it’s been so long. I go beyond on topics I actually find interesting, or seem like they will be relevant to my job for a longer period of time, where I will see some pay off. reply",

Later, when we added a driver, we brought in a driver expert to implement the driver, and I worked on how it integrated into the product.

They say 10,000 hours to become an expert, but that's brute forced learning. When you actually learn how to learn, what universities USED TO teach and have since stopped teaching, you can do it much quicker. People who know how to learn can become an expert in under 1000 hours. >In 2025, with everything in tech changing by the minute, I’m realizing I need to set boundaries about how deep I go on any particular topic. But I’m unsure how. Particularly if I don’t want to get left behind as things continue to evolve. that's the wrong way to approach it; or perhaps definition of depth? Depth to me is about a subject that cant be understood until certain other learning milestones have been learnt. Which is perhaps a depth, but also something you can force as something new. A new pattern that will as above be part of the learning. It's fine to go deep, so long as you're seeing a new pattern you cant predict. The limit isnt about depth, it's about seeing something new. reply",

          "text": "Practicality puts bounds on how much to rabbit hole. A theoretician in the purest sense is removed from practical constraints and timelines. He can, in principle, keep pursuing a subject until the day he dies. A practitioner is aiming for a practical result within a time frame. Because he has to deliver, he cannot afford to focus on developing a deep or exhaustive grasp of any particular thing. His focus isn't knowledge, after all, but the practical result. He will lean more on what he already knows, however limited, rather than pursuing new knowledge. He is less concerned with verifying the truth of claims himself and more concerned with trusting claims tactically by knowing whom to trust and when. So, in the capacity of practitioner, you must learn prudence, which is the virtue of knowing what should be done in a given situation. It is the basis for the moral life, as morality concerns itself with right action and right decision making. reply",

          "text": "I'm glad you made the commitment to change something in your life. Your previous job, and perhaps the way you approached it, was obviously not healthy. 1) The degree anxiety is understandable, but just in your head. I run a comp sci program for high schoolers as an replacement for universities. They don't get a degree but must learn how to signal they are capable. It's a skillset that most people don't learn until later in their careers. In your case, you likely have accumulated a number of valuable skills in your previous job. Since you haven't switched jobs, you haven't had much practice in communicating your skills to potential employers. Most engineers I know hate this, but it's sales/persuasion, and it's unavoidable and beneficial for you in the long-run. Take the perspective that you don't have a skill issue, but a signaling issue. 2) RE: AI - I would learn the fundamentals, only if you're interested in the engineering aspect of it, and implement some toy projects just to keep learning.  Try vibe coding, it's not going to kill you haha. Learn about its benefits and limitations so you can at least comment intelligently if it comes up. 3) Shipping projects is hard psychologically unless you've developed discipline or there are other constraints/deadlines. If I were you, I'd work on projects in a more social manner. That means building with other engineers, talking to people who would benefit from what you're building, or just helping out existing communities. The socialization would help keep your spirits up. It's also the best way to build relationships and open other opportunities. 4) Hiring/recruiting is going through big changes now, partially due to the rise of AI generated applications. Building trust via other channels is going to be much more important moving forward. We've had to more or less turn off all inbound hiring and rely on our vetted professional networks due to the massive glut of applications. Job search is brutal now, but it's just as bad on the hiring side. We're going through changes were the old methods don't work anymore, and the new haven't been figured out yet. Good luck! reply",

On your questions:\nI believe portfolios matter less than signal. A solid GitHub readme, a tiny demo with personality, or even a clean writeup can open doors. Hiring today is noisy, clarity stands out more than size. AI hype is mostly wrappers + vibes. But that's a feature. If you can ship small, real tools that feel smart, you’re ahead. Nobody’s expecting you to train models. On staying engaged: what helped me was shipping for insight, not polish. Projects as questions, not proof. The goal isn’t “a finished app,” it’s “what did I just learn about what I love, hate, or want to do more of?” You clearly still care about the craft, about growth. That’s the rarest signal of all.

          "text": ">- What are interviews like these days? Big tech is pretty standard.  You have to be impressive enough for a callback, then a possible tech screen where you write code in coderpad or something, then some combination of coding, behavioral, and architectural interviews almost always done virtually. lots of people practice on leetcode, I recommend everyone at least practice the common easier questions and solving them quickly.  The medium and hard ones are worth the investment if you're going for big tech, but maybe less important for startups that all have their own style of interviews (that vary quite a bit). Startups and no name medium sized companies can be random.  Some have collaborative coding, some copy big tech, some just talk to you, some look at portfolio projects or give take home assignments, anything and everything here. > How important is it to have a visable portfolio of working projects? Much less important than having recognizable names on the resume, and also less important than having contributions to known Open Source projects. I highly recommend putting time into existing well known projects (Apache, anything done from Meta/facebook/Google etc), and trying to get a PR accepted, than hacking away on your own project. Every senior in college has an extensive portfolio of projects on their github, it's very hard to tell how much was copied or how good it is. A much better signal is someone who can deal with the intricacies of an existing gargantuan codebase, go back and forth in PR comments, follow a style guide, work with maintainers, take criticism, have clear communication, and see something through (That may take a while!). > How much of the AI hype is HN nerds nerding out about AI versus actually implementing AI, versus gluing AI apis together? Eh, for me, AI has been amazing at teaching me a new PL, and porting small bits of code. It's been helpful for writing unit tests, getting scaffolding going, etc. but sometimes incomplete. It's been on rare occasions able to solve a bug for me. that's about it.  YMMV. Source - no degree, senior engineer at Google.  Also spent 10+ years working at shit companies and doing open source before getting a chance at bigger more well known companies, then doing that for ~8 until I could work my way into getting FAANG interviews. reply",

A degree isn't a finite indicator of a person's knowledge, capability, or achievements. 39 months after getting mine, I still haven't landed my first paid tech job to enter the industry, and I don't see that happening anytime soon, if ever. Granted, I haven't tried much in the past year, but it wasn't any better when I did. I once rejected the notion outright because, with obvious bias as a college student, I felt it invalidated everything I'd worked toward. But it's become apparent my degree meant nothing in the industry. On the contrary, you got a job and remained employed for 11 years. That piece of paper, or the lack thereof, didn't make a difference in what you experienced and accomplished. > I'm suffering from a lot of analysis paralysis trying to select a side project for a portfolio. How do you keep yourselves engaged with pet projects? My github is a field of projects 1/4 of the way completed before I lost steam on them. Personally I... don't. I started one of my projects back in August 2024. I made a homepage, UI, and a basic database schema... and then I blanked out on how to progress and hardly touched it for 11 months. I got some wind in my sails again in July - almost a full year later. A whole year of new experiences and insights, inside and out of the tech domain, led to better practices and features never conceived the first time around. So even if you're not coding or even looking at your project, who's to say you're not progressing with it? I read of this phenomenon in innovation called the S-curve, where advancements appear to occur rapidly in a short time due to a change in tech, paradigm, or process. Perhaps the next burst of progress simply requires time to find and cultivate through many seemingly insignificant insights gained from other experiences. No point in rushing through - if I'm not working on it, it's not the right time. That's also why I have like a billion (okay, more like 3-5) projects going. I hit a brick wall on one, so I work on something else where I have a clearer vision. Eventually, something triggers a flash of inspiration, and with a fresh mind, I can return and hit that burst of progress in the S-curve again. Eventually, I'll have many projects with lots of progress due to the staggered curves. Conceptualizing a whole project is daunting, too. Too many bells and whistles lead to a paralyzing spiral of overthinking and self-doubt. Everything has to be perfect and fleshed out. But the mantra of \"done is better than perfect\" rings true. Once there's a solid foundation, it's much easier to incrementally improve the project, rather than trying to get it right in one go, and eventually reach what was envisioned. I find it important to remember why I started a project in the first place. With my own imposter syndrome, I always gravitated toward doing what was considered best practices to be a \"real software engineer.\" I could never do right by myself, so I overcomplicated the tech stack and implementations to hell, following the words of others, trying to prove myself. If it wasn't complex and grueling, I wasn't doing anything worthwhile. However, I eventually reminded myself that the code is the least important part of my software project. I never started a project to have code, but to address a personally close issue or fulfill an itch. If the project addresses that goal, then why does it matter if the load times aren't perfectly optimized? Why does it matter if it doesn't scale to millions of users when I haven't even gotten 1 yet? Who cares if it's not \"impressive\" enough to hypothetical people I've never seen? Implementation has its considerations, but shouldn't be to the point of blocking all progress. Certainly not to where working on the project isn't fulfilling anymore. So, sometimes, after a long paralysis, I yell at myself mentally to, quote, \"Just freakin' do it already, for the love of everything holy, just write the fudging thing- [insert more aggressive self-yelling]\" , overriding my thoughts to do without that pesky thinking. But yeah, those are my accounts with those challenges. Good luck wherever the future takes you! reply",

I pride myself on having the courage to tackle any problem. For example, most recently, I added a feature to an open source client for SQL Server. The work involved dealing with binary protocols, which I hadn't done before, see here: https://github.com/denisenkom/pytds/pull/182 I'm currently also pursuing a masters in applied math, where I'm learning topics such as Numerical Methods, Risk Theory, Game Theory, Stochastic Processes, Statistics and others.",

Email: ar9tech@outlook.com I am a systems software engineer specializing in low-level software design for backend systems. My professional experience spans multiple compiled languages, including Rust, C++, and Go. I have developed REST API servers, gRPC programs, and background job handlers/schedulers. In Rust, I have extensive hands-on experience building low-level applications using the Tokio runtime, applying strong principles of distributed systems, and working with synchronization primitives such as Mutexes, RwLocks, and concurrent data structures. I also focus on performance optimizations that leverage the language’s zero-cost abstractions and memory model. I place strong emphasis on building reliable test environments, using real-world testing methodologies such as unit tests, integration tests, concurrency stress tests, and fixture-based simulations. I have worked with clients across several domains, including:\n- Image processing\n- Blockchain network layer design\n- Cloud infrastructure solutions One of my most significant Rust projects was developing and deploying a web-based terminal access system for LXD containers running on bare-metal servers. This system leveraged Tokio for concurrency, TTYD for terminal emulation, and Caddy as the reverse proxy, with communication over Unix Domain Sockets. The solution also supported authentication. Efficient and scalable under configuration of environment. I love playing with distributed system a lot and challenging myself to learn new concepts under this domain. reply",

I've also worked over a year in a classified setting and I still hold a security clearance. I'm looking for a junior/entry level software engineer position.

In general I want to advance the frontier of what's possible. My credentials are more towards research engineering than applied work, but I'm open to both. My last job was as a contract research engineer doing AI safety work at Redwood Research. I spent about half my time on our synthetic datasets of safe & unsafe LLM behavior, and the other half on fancy finetuning. I finetuned an LLM to exhibit unsafe behavior while fooling logistic probes trained to detect it, but only in deployment. Weird multi-part composite loss. My other big project is independent research in text-to-image models that are trained solely on unlabeled image data, exploiting CLIP embeddings for the link between text and images.

I do well with detail-oriented work. I have 14.7k reputation on StackOverflow and have answered over 300 questions there, mostly on .NET-related topics. (The link to my SO profile is on my CV.) I'm looking for a senior full stack or senior backend role. I was unable to work following issues during the pandemic, which are now resolved, but I'm rarely getting to talk with anyone to be considered for interviews; AI rejects my CV outright. I'm stuck in an algorithmic prison. Despite the length of break, my knowledge is current. If you need convincing of that, I recently got through the whole interview process at Moneybox for a senior backend role, which is pretty much the only interview I've had. Although they hired someone else, they spent a week trying to allocate extra budget to hire me. Unfortunately, that didn't happen, and so here I am. If you aren't hiring, but know someone who is, I'd appreciate you sharing my details with them. I can start straight away. If anyone has any advice to help break out of the AI auto rejections, I'd also appreciate it if you'd contact me via email. Thanks for reading.",

I have strong history building dependable software in environments from startups to large corporations, and I value opportunities to work with new technologies and languages. Growing teams and mentoring junior engineers are also essential skills on my CV. I am detail-oriented (testing and code comments are crucial), and I value effective and kind communication. I bring a mindset focused on reliability even under ambiguous requirements, and I try to do the \"right thing\" even when it's difficult. Right now, as side projects I'm working on writing an emulator in Rust, and an app for some task planning. Feel free to send an email or LinkedIn message! I always welcome good conversation and interesting technical challenges.",

If you are just trying to decrease the number of AI-generated applicants, one tactic I've seen is to ask applicants to complete a short (~30 minutes) evaluation alongside or even before applying. As in, your application won't be considered if this isn't done. That will weed out 95% of people who are just spitting fake applications at you -- it won't be worth their time. It might dissuade some real applicants, too - just be upfront about why you're doing it, and don't make your overall process onerous. The remaining folks, the ones who are actually trying to fake it for money, are harder to spot, and you will need more traditional methods. reply",

I should have scanned it in for posterity, because it looked like a government treaty from the 1890s. Gorgeous, but doubtful that anyone under the age of 45 could even read it, and almost certainly that anyone under the age of 35 couldn’t. I even did a wax seal on the back fold of the envelope. Obviously, neither produced any sort of a response, because mail-in Resumes are typical of companies that are trying to justify foreign workers. If the barriers to application are stupidly high, then of course they won’t have any domestic applications and will need to find foreign (and much cheaper) applicants. reply",

Most of the time the learning happens along the way, not necessarily in the solution itself but all the things you try and iterate on your journey to the solution. Everything changes in tech by the minute ... but also nothing changes. For web applications it has been HTML, CSS and JS for nearly 30 years. XMLHttpRequest/AJAX came out 25+ years ago. There have been many improvements along the way, like applying design patterns instead of cgi-bin directories with scripts that had a +x modifier on them in the file system. But the base technologies have not changed all that much. We still submit HTML form's with input fields to a back-end server that handles that data. We're still rendering HTML and using CSS to style it. Gone are custom UI toolkits like Flash or Java Applets. Maybe WASM is something to look into but it feels like its not mainstream to me. If you don't want to get left behind, learn the basic building blocks at a deep level, they don't change much. reply",

I’ve embraced that I cannot direct which topic my self-directed learning will take up and sustain (almost none of which ends up going toward tech stuff, aside from a span of some years in my teens and early 20s—and all of that was motivated by wanting to accomplish specific things with computers) and rely on assignments to motivate me for career-relevant learning. I’ll learn whatever it takes to get the job done. Then stop, because I don’t actually care about the tech per se , most of the time, and trying to force myself to learn “just because” does nothing but make me miserable and waste time. This isn’t even “how I approach learning as a generalist”, it’s how I became a generalist . My interest in continuing to fiddle with stuff after the job’s done is basically zero. My experience has been that it takes amazingly little effort to be above-median among practitioners at a lot of things. How many React developers have spent one entire hour reading through the core logic of React itself? How many people working with LLMs have read the Attention Is All You Need paper? How many people read about the disk storage layout of a database they’ve been told to use? It’s way less than half. It takes so very little to stand out. reply",

You've misunderstood, I think: if I have something I want to experiment with or build, then I can learn what I need. What I have such enormous trouble doing that I'm nearly incapable of it, is going \"I should learn this so I can do something , to be determined later, with it...\" and then learning. Making up projects for the sake of learning, when I don't really care about the ends, also doesn't work. I need the goal first, then I can learn what I need. I do also learn things just because I want to and for no real purpose, but have never been any good at directing that impulse. reply",

Never in my life have I made an active decision to stop learning about any one thing. You learn whatever skill is required to deal with the problem at hand and go on keep learning until you need a new skill or just get distracted. But also you're making an extremely bad mistake in your thinking here. Being a generalist does not preclude being a master. In fact, I've found that in today's market you must have specializations. Right now I'm selling myself as an electronics engineer and embedded C programmer. But my deepest expertice is C#, where I consider myself to be a fairly high level expert. My current job is writing react native with some EE on the side. You're trying to actively spread yourself even thinner which is a huge error. Knowing almost nothing about everything is not useful today, we just use AI for that. You need some real, solid skills to work from. You also need to be able to be a specialist and do specialist work because you are not likely to find a good generalist role. There aren't many such roles and they're getting harder to find. But all in all my answer is no. There is no point where you should stop learning any one thing. Follow your passions and what's interesting. Finding a subject you're interested in and spending a ton of time learning about it isn't a bad thing. That's how you figure out what you like and how you build real skills. You should follow particular subjects into mastery because a generalist without any specialization is not actually very useful unless you're a world class engineer. It's clichéd, but genuinely follow whatever subjects make you happy and find a way to make that work for you. reply",

If their answer sounds too good to be true, I'll schedule some appointments with other experts and take the most pessimistic answer. Ultimately, it's my responsibility that my taxes are correct, so I need to understand how they work. I switched off of using tax software and do my taxes by hand, including rental income and stock sales. I'd estimate my tax return is 20-30 pages at this point. If I ran my own company, I'd hand my taxes off to a tax expert at the point where filling out all of the forms represented such a significant investment in time that it detracted from my ability to run the company, but they would have to be significantly more complicated than anything the average person encounters. I would also hand them off to a separate firm if they reached the point where I needed credentials for the tax return to be valid - such as to assess the value of inventory. It really doesn't take that much effort to learn how to do your own taxes, and the VITA program provides good free training in exchange for volunteering, which provides essential practice time anyway. reply",

This approach has even gotten me through obscure edge cases like a company over-contributing to an HSA. The tax code isn't magic and isn't full of gotchas. The rules may be arbitrary, but they're easy to follow and the IRS won't punish you as long as you're making a reasonable effort and report all of your income. There's an IRS help line you can call. People only really run into trouble when they try to take absurd deductions or claim that whatever tech investment strategy they've invested in doesn't count as income.

What I'm saying is that specialization is not antithetical to generalization. A good generalist should have areas of expertise because we can't cover everything . You don't need to be a world class expert, but you do need to find a niche for yourself and IMO the best way to do that is to simply follow what you find interesting. reply",

So I tend to continue to take in what I can, staying somewhat shallow outside of what's in front of me, or otherwise has my interest. Right now, my secondary interests are around rust and adapting legacy tech (BBS Doors, Telnet, etc), so if I look into something more, that's where I'm more inclined to do it.  I'm also a bit lazy. I'll dig fairly deep in terms of what's in front of me.  I'm actively working on a green C# backend so I've brought in FastEndpoints (new to me, but similar to other tech I've used) while also relying heavily on Dapper and MS-SQL Server and Grate for migrations.  The use of C# and SQL Server are outside my control, as is deploying to Windows.  That said, having some awareness of the ecosystem over the years lets me be able to bring in newer options that fit well over time. By contrast, if I were working in a JS target (Node, Cloudflare, etc) I'd probably be leaning heavily into Hono+Zod+OpenAPI libraries.  Again, relatively current in that space. In the end, I just try to have awareness of what is shaping up in the communities and trying not to dive into anything I can't make use of now. reply",

          "text": "It took me decades to find a \"learning routine\", but it now looks like this: 1. Imitate. Find a way to boil down what I'm looking at to \"monkey see, monkey do\". Kindergarten songs and projects. Tracing the letters. Making the same poses as the athletes. 2. Isolate. Look for the drills that simplify the goal to particular success benchmarks. E.g. \"drawing\" -> \"draw the outline without looking at your paper(blind contour)\". Turn the isolation into a primary warmup for the activity. 3. Improvise. Now it's time to actually start making new things and integrating the concepts, using the structure from the previous practice. Improvisation can be practiced with games and challenges that are loosely structured(see: actual short-form improv games like \"Five Things\") The learning in tech always tends to have either a \"hardware up\" approach(computer engineering, operating systems, low-level protocols) or a \"abstraction down\" approach(problem domain languages and application interfaces). The parts in between get swept up and rearranged with great frequency; they are the implementation detail, and may have some incidental automation, but usually they just reflect Conway's law in some form - they become standard because the situation asks for a standard, and then politicking proceeds to take over as career-minded individuals jump on board and try to steer the technical conversation their way, to their standard, where they will receive credit. We also keep coming up with new things to automate, motivating new problem domain abstractions. Thus: you stand to gain a ton by closely examining the roots of the systems you work with, just sitting there with a pen and a notebook doing the earliest imitation processes on their code and documentation. Proceeding to the more isolated parts of building an actual project with the system is often superfluous, if you've encountered the main concepts before. reply",

Going out of my way to dive deep on something I will never use seems like a waste of time to me. My company sent me to Citrix training years ago. I was going to get certified, but didn’t end up doing it. The class and certification seem designed for someone setting up the entire Citrix infra for their company. In my role, I just made a publish app here and there, which I already knew how to do. After the training, our use of Citrix went down, and I haven’t touched it at all in 10 years. I’m glad I didn’t waste my time deep diving on technology I’d never actually use. If we use it again in the future, I’ll have to re-learn it either way, since it’s been so long.

          "text": "TBH it's very difficult to gauge when to stop pursuing something. Personally, I learn something up until it stops becoming useful and/or it starts becoming more of a burden on my mental overhead. Doesn't mean I'm never going to go back to it, it just means I accomplished what I needed to do with the minimum amount of knowledge. From there on out it is entirely dependent on how much the topic interested me. Most of the time I'll end up going back to a topic anyways since making things isn't just about designing and creating the thing, it's also maintaining it. At that point it's more about whether or not you can pursue a project due to it's knowledge requirements, but I believe that falls out of the bounds of your question. This is my rule of thumb: Learn what you need to know first for your task at hand. If your curiosity can't be contained, make a mental note. If that mental note doesn't go anywhere and you keep dwelling on the thought of it, pursue it until your curiosity is satisfied. If done successfully, repeat. You COULD write it down, but if you're anything like me you'll just end up with a desk filled to the brim with post it notes and never actually going back to 90% of those topics. Which kills a lot of trees. If you're into that sorta thing, don't let me stop you. Making a mental note is much better since if the topic is of interest to you, then you will not forget about it. Therefore, you'll let your curiosity build up until you cannot contain yourself and have to learn more about the topic. NOTE:\nBeing a generalist usually comes because of a deep sense of curiosity in a wide range of topics. Take your time and enjoy the process of learning things since that will guarantee the longevity of your curiosity without burnout. reply",

Irrelevant implementation details change by the minute, but they are irrelevant expect in the very moment you need that detail, so only learn them by repetitive use.  Meanwhile the fundamentals do not change, as a generalist you will be looking to learn those so that when you need details you understand what the implementation is doing.  As you get older (more experienced) you will start to see how the the latest implementation is change either for the sake of change, or corruption (that is you can convince someone it is innovative and thus make money even though you are making things objectively worse - see touch screens in cars), soon you with be shaking your first at the stars and yelling to the wind how much better it used to be (while ignoring all progress!) Tech is not changing by the minute.  There have been only minor changes since I was in elementary school in the 1980s.  8 bit to 64 bit CPUS are a minor change since they fundamentally do the same thing. We were doing some interesting GUIs in the 1980s.  (I'm not old enough to remember the XEROX systems of the 1970s much less tech before then).

The rationalized answer is that expertise requires maintenance, and a low likelihood of using some expertise doesn't justify that maintenance. For example, I am unlikely to ever do advanced financial planning, and I can re-learn / lookup the formulas for doing calculations, or maybe even re-derive them if I really need to.

He can, in principle, keep pursuing a subject until the day he dies. A practitioner is aiming for a practical result within a time frame. Because he has to deliver, he cannot afford to focus on developing a deep or exhaustive grasp of any particular thing. His focus isn't knowledge, after all, but the practical result. He will lean more on what he already knows, however limited, rather than pursuing new knowledge. He is less concerned with verifying the truth of claims himself and more concerned with trusting claims tactically by knowing whom to trust and when. So, in the capacity of practitioner, you must learn prudence, which is the virtue of knowing what should be done in a given situation. It is the basis for the moral life, as morality concerns itself with right action and right decision making. reply",

They say 10,000 hours to become an expert, but that's brute forced learning. When you actually learn how to learn, what universities USED TO teach and have since stopped teaching, you can do it much quicker. People who know how to learn can become an expert in under 1000 hours. >In 2025, with everything in tech changing by the minute, I’m realizing I need to set boundaries about how deep I go on any particular topic. But I’m unsure how. Particularly if I don’t want to get left behind as things continue to evolve. that's the wrong way to approach it; or perhaps definition of depth? Depth to me is about a subject that cant be understood until certain other learning milestones have been learnt. Which is perhaps a depth, but also something you can force as something new. A new pattern that will as above be part of the learning. It's fine to go deep, so long as you're seeing a new pattern you cant predict.

I.e. \"classic\" desktop security is kind of a blacklist model (everything is possible unless explicitly restricted e.g. via sandbox) while capbility-based security is like a whitelist.<p>On a programming language level it's usually known as object-capability model, and there's a number of programming languages which implement it: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model<p>The question: why isn't it more popular? It doesn't even seem to be widely known, let alone used. (Aside from isolated examples.)<p>Is there any chance it would be widely adopted?<p>I guess one objection is that people don't want to manually configure security. But perhaps it can be integrated into normal UX if we really think about it: e.g. if you select a file using a system-provided file picker it would automatically grant access to that file, as access is explicitly authorized.</p></p></p></p></p></div>",

So if don't need to support POSIX APIs (\"I WANT TO JUST fopen!!!\") it's much easier. reply",

Let’s use Apple as an example, as they tend to do major transitions on a regular basis. So, let’s say that the top tier already approved the new security mode(l). Now, how to do it? My understanding is that most if not all APIs would have to be changed or replaced. So that's pretty much a new OS, that needs new apps (if the APIs change, you cannot simply recompile the apps). Now, if you expose the existing APIs to the new OS/apps, then what's the gain? And if you don't expose them, then you basically need a VM. I mean, I don’t know Darwin syscalls, but I suspect you might need new syscalls as well. And so you end up with a brand new OS that lives in a VM and has no apps. So it's likely order(s?) of magnitude more profitable to just harden the existing platforms. reply",

A program that receives a proxy does not know if it is a proxy or not (or what it is a proxy of); it can only send/receive messages. I also had similar idea like calling programs in the command shell, although in mine, a program cannot even return a value without being given a capability to send the result to (although there may be syntactic sugar to handle this without needing to write that explicitly), and the result will always be the same if any input it receives is the same (and in the same order); a capability is even required to determine the current date/time, etc. (One of the forks of a program file would specify the expected type of the initial message, which the command shell can use for type checking and related stuff like that.) Their \"vats\" are similar to my idea of how processes might be made, but different in many ways. A process consists of memory, which may include references to capabilities, and also includes the processing state. It does not necessarily use a event loop, although it can be implemented in that way. I did not consider using promises; I am unsure if it is necessary, which it might not be. However, my idea uses native code (with its own instruction set) rather than Guile or Scheme or Lisp, and system calls will be used for doing I/O with capabilities (and there aren't many system calls for doing other things than that). (Emulation would probably be possible (directly of the instruction set, or of the command shell and other higher-level stuff, or a combination), although I also have a different keyboard layout and other things different from existing systems.) Also, there are more things to be considered than related there. For example, nested transactions of multiple objects at once (even if they do not necessarily know each other), multiple locking, the hypertext file system model, etc. I also would not use JSON and would not use Unicode. reply",

          "text": "I think that, if it is done well (which will require a new operating system design (and a new instruction set may also be helpful); I have many ideas), it will have more benefits than only security. It is much like the object-capability model described on Wikipedia, and it is neither a blacklist model nor a whitelist  model. A whitelist model would have a list (or other criteria) of what is permitted, but for a better capability-based system, it works differently. My idea involves capabilities (which can include proxy capabilities as well; i.e. it is not necessarily what you asked for, but you can send/receive messages anyways) which can be sent and used like the object-capability model, including as the initial message (instead of using command-line arguments, file descriptors, etc, it uses the \"initial message\"; this is like the \"initial conditions\" described on Wikipedia), which should include some capabilities otherwise it cannot do any I/O and will be automatically terminated (before the program gets a chance to run) if no debugger is attached. (Unlike the standard object-capability model, there is no \"endowment\" (at least at the level of the operating system, although programming languages might have this feature); the capability does nothing by itself, but the process that created it can receive messages that itself and/or other processes send to it and use them for whatever that capability is intended to mean.) Some benefits of a proxy capability system includes that many other things become unnecessary, since they can be done with proxies, such as: finer permissions than the capabilities normally allow, adding print preview to a program that does not have that feature (but that is able to print), simulating error conditions, testing if the date/time handling of a program would work correctly on February 29 (or some other date, or a leap second, etc) without needing to change the clock on your computer, accessing resources on another computer as though they are local (and vice-versa), etc. You might be able to pass capabilities using the command shell like how on UNIX you can use pipes, but in this one you would pass capabilities instead (as well as the ability to create your own). > I guess one objection is that people don't want to manually configure security. In many ways, reasonable defaults can be configured, and some things can be configured automatically, although it would still be possible to manually set them to whatever you want them to be. > if you select a file using a system-provided file picker it would automatically grant access to that file, as access is explicitly authorized Nevertheless, there are problems with such things, especially if you try to add them to existing systems. For example, a program might require access to additional files depending on the one accessed (either referenced by those files or by a modification of the original file's name (e.g. the journal file in SQLite)), configuration files and command-line arguments, etc. You would also need to consider such things as popen (many of my programs use it, with a command specified by the user at run time or specified in a configuration file). In a new operating system design you could also change the file system model as well, in order to help with this (I had ideas about how to do this, too). reply",

This is like asking what ink-and-paper printer to buy for making complex, multi-format printed books to specific criteria, while admitting that you've not used any form of publishing software or understand any of the non-software processes involved in making a book. The slicer is by far your most important tool for _effective_ 3D printing with a variety of materials, moreso than CAD or 3D modeling. Get a cheaper, more plug-and-play printer that doesn't meet all of your criteria, and focus on learning how to effectively use its slicer. Print basic things, experiment, and force and make hands-on mistakes with it on relatively forgiving PLA/PETG. Do these _before_ jumping up to a pricier, fully enclosed machine _and also_ before printing harder-to-use materials, each of which will add new difficulties. You don't want your first hotend blob to happen on a decent machine that you actually like while using a material that's difficult or dangerous to deal with. A Sovol SV06 or SV08 meets most of your criteria at about 1/3 to 1/2 of your budget; I haven't had the best experiences with their reliability but they fit many of your criteria. Used Creality Enders might be even cheaper depending on where you are, and while also fussy are hackable and repairable to the point of often being used as platforms for entirely different printers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmMW6_7lrlQ reply",

          "text": "I agree in principle with the above comment, but for some additional context - slicer software has gotten really, really good these days. Especially (sadly) if you don't need open source software. To make a CNC machining metaphor - Slicer software is basically just your interface to the dials and knobs on the CNC settings for speeds and feeds. There's more settings, because 3d printing is more like if a CNC had a baby with a welder and an injection molding press, only it's injecting and simultaneously welding up a blob of plastic. You're balancing the toolpaths, the temps, the adhesion, and the overall speed all at the same time, all for whatever material you're using. So it's complex, but these companies have a ton of data and experience in order to make sure their preset settings are damn good out of the box. And these days, they get it right more often than they get it wrong! Long story short - you should probably just get a Bambu. You'll learn what you need to learn from it, while having good quality output the whole time. If you find out it's not suitable for what you're looking to do, then you can sell it used with decent resale and get the best printer for your specific application. reply",

If you have a lot of time to spend, you could build a Voron, but I would not recommend that to anyone new to 3D printing. reply",

          "text": "There are fully open projects like Voron or RatRig, and sellers of DIY kits based on them.  Potentially a lot of work unless you're interested in 3D printing itself as a hobby rather than as a tool. Prusa Core One would be a bit more complete OOTB.  It is 220mm in the smallest axis (Y) though.  Slicer and firmware are open source, but the hardware is not (unlike previous Prusa printers). Bambu gives you the same capability for much less, but the firmware is not open source (third party open source firmware does exist).  I believe the stock firmware also has to \"phone home\" at least once before it can be used offline. Even cheaper are less-well known Chinese companies, like Qidi.  Firmware is usually a proprietary fork of Klipper or other open source projects; some people have had success flashing the mainline version. reply",

Businesses should be businesses and handle their own taxes and legal obligations by themselves. Additionally, if you get involved in between the seller and the buyer, YOU are now liable when it comes to taxes, as you become de-facto the seller, you have to handle returns/refunds(including the tax aspect and have to handle already paid taxes in such cases as well), audits and other legal aspects. There is simply no good reason why you should involve yourself in this whatsoever. Just facilitate the business transaction, but not the financial transaction. reply",

No. Proof: https://youtu.be/HcSOz-Lsxgg?feature=shared&t=293 So this video's claim, if I got it right while skimming in a subway, is that when Prusa redesigned the part cooling fan shroud to improve overhang performance they also went ahead and improved the slicer, and the benchmark results that have them generally win overhang comparisons around that time may be attributed more to the software fix than the new HW parts. That's very interesting information, thanks for sharing. It's also exactly the kind of thing where a Bambu fan would normally go \"oh, so they just made the better integrated product that works better in the end without the customer having to care why\". But I totally agree they should document this transparently since Prusa Slicer can also be used with off-brand printers to good success. > Prusa slicer is also a fork ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Sure, which it very prominently displays on the splash screeen to this day instead of hiding it, giving credit where credit is due. The difference is that it was forked off from Slic3r much longer ago, Slic3r isn't really actively developed anymore, and Prusa has largely rewritten it since. So it's a false equivalence.

It prints just fine. Sits for months. Fires up every time. First layers perfect every time. The \"printer being the hobby\" is only true if you let it. Even cheap no name open source printers are really good these days, and in the high end there are plenty that are competitive with Bambu on print quality, out of the box experience, and features, often exceeding them. I dunno, I guess I just don't think having to let a printer talk to some fucking cloud service in China so I can start an STL print from my phone is all that important of a feature. reply",

Often, 3D printed guns are just a lower receiver, that is the part you hold in your hand, the parts that actually fire the bullets (barrel, pin, slide, etc...) are bought off the shelf from real gun manufacturers. This is a workaround for some laws that considers gun parts to not be a gun. For example, outside of a gun, a barrel is just a metal pipe and can be traded freely. The part that makes a gun a gun is the lower receiver, and you can 3D print that in plastic and still get good performance. In fact, Glock makes this part in plastic and these are some of the most popular and proven guns in the world. reply",

UX would include the ability to easily tear down a hot end, replace a nozzle, tighten any belts, and anything else that would affect your ability to print high quality prints. For prusa, since that's the printer I have experience with the most.  Replacing the nozzle and clearing filament jams are pretty easy.  But tearing down the hot end to remove debris wrapped around the extruder gear was not. reply",

          "text": "It's worth noting though that this part of the game is about to change majorly for both brands. Prusa is widely known to launch their next-generation tool changer at Formnext in Nov, which is going to be a concept where you have a rack of nozzle+heatpipe+filament tube tools that the print head grabs and heats up inductively. And Bambu is more or less working on something similar they will probably launch some time next year. This is totally changing the \"nozzle swap\" equation. It means purge-free and much faster multi-material printing without outright duplicating print heads like the XL does, and the ability to park and mix nozzle sizes as well. It'll be cool to see which company pulls it off better. As someone who was never convinced by either Bambu's shoddy and wasteful AMS or Prusa's ridiculously humongous MMU+Buffer approach, this is the leap I've been waiting for for an upgrade.

To someone completely new who hasn't followed any real developments occurring in the industry, it was confusing but it seemed like the Sovol SV06 was a good \"starting point\". Well I didn't realize how far behind the industry still was. I thought surely at this point all printers much just be load file -> load filament -> click print. Just like regular printers no? Nope, doing dumb things like using some third party slicer tool, transferring a file to a microsd card manually and then babying the printer for its super slow error prone prints feels like its still a toy not a professional device. Imagine having to do that level of nonsense for your laser printer? Yeah maybe back in the days of \"Office Space\" but not today! I was in a time crunch so out of desperation I took a gamble and dropped a wad of cash on a Bambu X1C. It is what I consider a professional product for normies in my eyes. Most everything else are just toys. I was ready to say Bambu, Bambu and nothing but Bambu but then I read the user's last few sentences.

Prusa is by far the most \"open\" probably with the SV08 second because it uses so much from the open source community (it's Voron inspired).

They're CHEAP, and there's plenty of aftermarket support, but that ends up turning the printer into a product for someone who sees the printer itself being a hobby, rather than the printer being merely an appliance that produces things. Buying a Creality printer is like buying a hobby-grade RC car (ie, Traxxas, Team Associated, etc.).  Decent out of the box, but you're likely going to be reaching for buying upgraded parts and it eventually becomes a Ship of Theseus. I have an Ender 3 Pro, my list of upgrades: - Replace the crappy flexible mat with PEI-coated flexsteel - Filament runout detector - Motherboard replacement (made flashing custom firmware 100x easier, and uses quieter stepper motor drivers) - Automatic bed leveler - Dual-gear extruder - Customized firmware that changes the 3x3 bed leveling matrix to 7x7 - OctoPi A decent printer will have half of these features already built in. reply",

          "text": "I did a similar path to you (Ender 3 Pro, same updates as you except runout), and I was miserable.  Yes, I learned a lot about 3d printing while doing it, but I basically never printed unless I REALLY needed something, because I knew I'd spend a bunch of time fiddling and failed prints to get it working.  A friend with an unmodified Ender 3 Pro has much better experience. I wanted a Prusa but didn't want to drop the money on it when I first got started, so I thought I'd just add a bed leveler to get less tweaking and more reliable prints, and it went downhill from there. I ended up getting a Bambu P1S, and gave the Ender 3 Pro to my kids school.  In a twist of fate, I basically had to undo all the upgrades I did (I was able to keep the new mobo and Sprite extruder though) because the school IT couldn't allow OctoPi on the network and they needed something they could just drop an SD card in. The Bambu P1S has been a real workhorse.  In the first couple months I printed more stuff than I had with the Ender 3 Pro in 5 years.  And the multi-filament AMS has been a lot of fun for making multi-color prints.  I'm kind of glad I learned everything I did with my Ender, but now I want to focus on creating models and printing. Prusa apparently makes great printers, I like their ideals and almost got one, but in the end I decided to go with the Bambu because of the AMS and a Father's Day sale and have been extremely happy. reply",

As I worked more with it, I upgraded it a ton, putting about as much money into it as it cost (which wasn’t much). In the end, it’s a decent printer for what I want to do with it. I added: * Bed leveler * Flexible build surface * direct drive extruder * second z axis screw drive * octopi Everything except for the octopi was a Creality kit. So it’s not like they don’t know their market is looking to tinker and do upgrades themselves. If you want to make things because the end product is the goal, get something fancier. If you want to know how and why it works, spending a bit more time on the journey part (which might be frustrating), the Creality might be a good fit. It’s not going to have the same user-experience as a Bamboo or Prusa, but for me, that’s okay. reply",

Enclosed with filter for ABS fumes etc. Personally I've only used their A1, but it's the best printer I've ever used by far, and it's the first one that you can treat like a paper printer: plop it down, ignore it til you need to print, hit print and assume it works with no supervision. An absolute joy. It's also FAST compared to last gen printers. They do have a bunch of cloud service BS and phoning home that runs afoul of the HN spirit, but there's a LAN mode that allows you to send prints from LAN without opening up to the wider internet. If that's still too restrictive, you can always do direct SD card transfers via sneakernet. Software might be too closed for you, IDK if there are jailbreaks. Repairability is possible but fiddly – akin to current gen car engines, rather than 70s types. They're very popular printers, I've only needed to open the head once, and there were plenty of YT teardown videos to help. The Bambu slicer is good. They've got niceties for basic operations like snapping to bed or scaling up/down by a few percent. I believe it's based on cura slicer, which is also excellent. P1S is at the midpoint of your budget. Their next model up is $1200, depending on your flexibility. Might have some value if you're doing more obscure materials. Didn't realize how cheap the enclosed ones had gotten. I've got half a mind to upgrade myself now.... reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I’m working on a project where I need to extract user intents and move them to deterministic tool/function/api executions + afterwards refining/transforming the results by another set of tools. Since gathering the right intent and parameters (there are a lot of subtle differences in potential prompts) is quite challenging I’m using a long consecutive executed list of prompts to fine tune to gather exactly the right pieces of information needed to have somewhat reliable tool executions. I tried this with a bunch of agent frameworks (including langchain/langgraph) but it gets very messy very quickly and this messiness is creating a lot of side effects easily.<p>So I wonder if there is a tool, approach, anything to keep better control of chains of LLM executions which don’t end up in a messy configuration and/or code execution implementation? Maybe even something more visual, or am I the only struggling with this?</p></div>",

I remembered when the iPhone came out, I would spend every minute of my commute learning about how to build an app.<p>Now that I have a family and am a bit older, I feel much less ambitious. I no longer feel the desire to build a business, or hack on side projects. Granted, a lot of this is because I have less time, but even at work, i feel absolutely no desire to learn new things, or get a promotion.<p>Is there any way I can revive that ambition again?</p></p></div>",

I’m grateful I didn’t have family/kids yet, it gave me space. But I see friends with families still searching for their next vision and mission. It’s never easy to recapture the hunger we had in our early 20s. What helped me is that treat “finding your vision” less like a high-pressure quest, more like playing a game—keep asking yourself honest questions (no pressure), make a bucket list, and use first principles to understand what really matters to you. For me, it took 18 months... This process is a lot like starting a company from scratch. Keep exploring, stay curious, and don’t be hard on yourself if you don’t have big desires right now. That’s okay too. reply",

Most of the time the learning happens along the way, not necessarily in the solution itself but all the things you try and iterate on your journey to the solution. Everything changes in tech by the minute ... but also nothing changes. For web applications it has been HTML, CSS and JS for nearly 30 years. XMLHttpRequest/AJAX came out 25+ years ago. There have been many improvements along the way, like applying design patterns instead of cgi-bin directories with scripts that had a +x modifier on them in the file system. But the base technologies have not changed all that much. We still submit HTML form's with input fields to a back-end server that handles that data. We're still rendering HTML and using CSS to style it. Gone are custom UI toolkits like Flash or Java Applets. Maybe WASM is something to look into but it feels like its not mainstream to me. If you don't want to get left behind, learn the basic building blocks at a deep level, they don't change much. reply",

I’ve embraced that I cannot direct which topic my self-directed learning will take up and sustain (almost none of which ends up going toward tech stuff, aside from a span of some years in my teens and early 20s—and all of that was motivated by wanting to accomplish specific things with computers) and rely on assignments to motivate me for career-relevant learning. I’ll learn whatever it takes to get the job done. Then stop, because I don’t actually care about the tech per se , most of the time, and trying to force myself to learn “just because” does nothing but make me miserable and waste time. This isn’t even “how I approach learning as a generalist”, it’s how I became a generalist . My interest in continuing to fiddle with stuff after the job’s done is basically zero. My experience has been that it takes amazingly little effort to be above-median among practitioners at a lot of things. How many React developers have spent one entire hour reading through the core logic of React itself? How many people working with LLMs have read the Attention Is All You Need paper? How many people read about the disk storage layout of a database they’ve been told to use? It’s way less than half. It takes so very little to stand out. reply",

What I have such enormous trouble doing that I'm nearly incapable of it, is going \"I should learn this so I can do something , to be determined later, with it...\" and then learning. Making up projects for the sake of learning, when I don't really care about the ends, also doesn't work. I need the goal first, then I can learn what I need.

Never in my life have I made an active decision to stop learning about any one thing. You learn whatever skill is required to deal with the problem at hand and go on keep learning until you need a new skill or just get distracted. But also you're making an extremely bad mistake in your thinking here. Being a generalist does not preclude being a master. In fact, I've found that in today's market you must have specializations. Right now I'm selling myself as an electronics engineer and embedded C programmer. But my deepest expertice is C#, where I consider myself to be a fairly high level expert. My current job is writing react native with some EE on the side. You're trying to actively spread yourself even thinner which is a huge error. Knowing almost nothing about everything is not useful today, we just use AI for that. You need some real, solid skills to work from. You also need to be able to be a specialist and do specialist work because you are not likely to find a good generalist role. There aren't many such roles and they're getting harder to find. But all in all my answer is no. There is no point where you should stop learning any one thing. Follow your passions and what's interesting. Finding a subject you're interested in and spending a ton of time learning about it isn't a bad thing. That's how you figure out what you like and how you build real skills. You should follow particular subjects into mastery because a generalist without any specialization is not actually very useful unless you're a world class engineer. It's clichéd, but genuinely follow whatever subjects make you happy and find a way to make that work for you. reply",

If their answer sounds too good to be true, I'll schedule some appointments with other experts and take the most pessimistic answer. Ultimately, it's my responsibility that my taxes are correct, so I need to understand how they work. I switched off of using tax software and do my taxes by hand, including rental income and stock sales. I'd estimate my tax return is 20-30 pages at this point. If I ran my own company, I'd hand my taxes off to a tax expert at the point where filling out all of the forms represented such a significant investment in time that it detracted from my ability to run the company, but they would have to be significantly more complicated than anything the average person encounters. I would also hand them off to a separate firm if they reached the point where I needed credentials for the tax return to be valid - such as to assess the value of inventory. It really doesn't take that much effort to learn how to do your own taxes, and the VITA program provides good free training in exchange for volunteering, which provides essential practice time anyway. reply",

This approach has even gotten me through obscure edge cases like a company over-contributing to an HSA. The tax code isn't magic and isn't full of gotchas. The rules may be arbitrary, but they're easy to follow and the IRS won't punish you as long as you're making a reasonable effort and report all of your income. There's an IRS help line you can call. People only really run into trouble when they try to take absurd deductions or claim that whatever tech investment strategy they've invested in doesn't count as income.

Depth to me is about a subject that cant be understood until certain other learning milestones have been learnt. Which is perhaps a depth, but also something you can force as something new. A new pattern that will as above be part of the learning. It's fine to go deep, so long as you're seeing a new pattern you cant predict.

I tend to read tech articles, documentation, etc pretty voraciously.

So I tend to continue to take in what I can, staying somewhat shallow outside of what's in front of me, or otherwise has my interest. Right now, my secondary interests are around rust and adapting legacy tech (BBS Doors, Telnet, etc), so if I look into something more, that's where I'm more inclined to do it.  I'm also a bit lazy. I'll dig fairly deep in terms of what's in front of me.  I'm actively working on a green C# backend so I've brought in FastEndpoints (new to me, but similar to other tech I've used) while also relying heavily on Dapper and MS-SQL Server and Grate for migrations.  The use of C# and SQL Server are outside my control, as is deploying to Windows.  That said, having some awareness of the ecosystem over the years lets me be able to bring in newer options that fit well over time. By contrast, if I were working in a JS target (Node, Cloudflare, etc) I'd probably be leaning heavily into Hono+Zod+OpenAPI libraries.  Again, relatively current in that space. In the end, I just try to have awareness of what is shaping up in the communities and trying not to dive into anything I can't make use of now. reply",

Kindergarten songs and projects. Tracing the letters. Making the same poses as the athletes. 2. Isolate. Look for the drills that simplify the goal to particular success benchmarks. E.g. \"drawing\" -> \"draw the outline without looking at your paper(blind contour)\". Turn the isolation into a primary warmup for the activity. 3. Improvise. Now it's time to actually start making new things and integrating the concepts, using the structure from the previous practice. Improvisation can be practiced with games and challenges that are loosely structured(see: actual short-form improv games like \"Five Things\") The learning in tech always tends to have either a \"hardware up\" approach(computer engineering, operating systems, low-level protocols) or a \"abstraction down\" approach(problem domain languages and application interfaces). The parts in between get swept up and rearranged with great frequency; they are the implementation detail, and may have some incidental automation, but usually they just reflect Conway's law in some form - they become standard because the situation asks for a standard, and then politicking proceeds to take over as career-minded individuals jump on board and try to steer the technical conversation their way, to their standard, where they will receive credit. We also keep coming up with new things to automate, motivating new problem domain abstractions. Thus: you stand to gain a ton by closely examining the roots of the systems you work with, just sitting there with a pen and a notebook doing the earliest imitation processes on their code and documentation. Proceeding to the more isolated parts of building an actual project with the system is often superfluous, if you've encountered the main concepts before. reply",

          "text": "TBH it's very difficult to gauge when to stop pursuing something. Personally, I learn something up until it stops becoming useful and/or it starts becoming more of a burden on my mental overhead. Doesn't mean I'm never going to go back to it, it just means I accomplished what I needed to do with the minimum amount of knowledge. From there on out it is entirely dependent on how much the topic interested me. Most of the time I'll end up going back to a topic anyways since making things isn't just about designing and creating the thing, it's also maintaining it. At that point it's more about whether or not you can pursue a project due to it's knowledge requirements, but I believe that falls out of the bounds of your question. This is my rule of thumb: Learn what you need to know first for your task at hand. If your curiosity can't be contained, make a mental note. If that mental note doesn't go anywhere and you keep dwelling on the thought of it, pursue it until your curiosity is satisfied. If done successfully, repeat. You COULD write it down, but if you're anything like me you'll just end up with a desk filled to the brim with post it notes and never actually going back to 90% of those topics. Which kills a lot of trees. If you're into that sorta thing, don't let me stop you. Making a mental note is much better since if the topic is of interest to you, then you will not forget about it. Therefore, you'll let your curiosity build up until you cannot contain yourself and have to learn more about the topic. NOTE:\nBeing a generalist usually comes because of a deep sense of curiosity in a wide range of topics. Take your time and enjoy the process of learning things since that will guarantee the longevity of your curiosity without burnout. reply",

I focused on working mostly on the business logic, and muddled through the UI. We brought in a UI expert to polish the UI. Later, when we added a driver, we brought in a driver expert to implement the driver, and I worked on how it integrated into the product. On that product I also became \"good enough\" at Mac programming because it was a cross-platform product, and I focused on our cross-platform logic abstracted Mac and Windows.

As you get older (more experienced) you will start to see how the the latest implementation is change either for the sake of change, or corruption (that is you can convince someone it is innovative and thus make money even though you are making things objectively worse - see touch screens in cars), soon you with be shaking your first at the stars and yelling to the wind how much better it used to be (while ignoring all progress!)

If you end up either using a particular tool a lot and a nicer/more expensive version of it will make your life better you then upgrade. If you end up breaking the cheaper one you also invest the money into upgrading. You generally find that you are only upgrading a small fraction of your toolbox this way, and save quite a bit of money vs. buying an entire set of expensive professional grade gear. I see that for skillsets as well. Why waste time on knowing the nitty gritty deep level of something if I will rarely come back to use it again.

The rationalized answer is that expertise requires maintenance, and a low likelihood of using some expertise doesn't justify that maintenance.

But, you can’t keep up and feeling like you ever kept up is an illusion of youth. So my advice: If you have to pick something to learn (because you do not know useful things to learn) consider things that have been around a while like Linux and JavaScript and C++ and RDBMS etc.\nbecause they probably aren’t going to stop being relevant.

Like Joel Spolsky hiring criteria, I make sure I continue to have experience that shows “I am smart and gets things done” and I pick a lane to go deep in - “cloud native green field implementations”.  If that lane starts to narrow, I’ll jump on projects at work that get me into another lane. Technology is just a tool. Anything you learn new, Tens of thousands of others will learn the same thing. Learning technology and not knowing how to communicate with the “business” and how to communicate adding business value will not help you stand out. I’ve done this for over 30 years. reply",

You need to add to your application a deterrent, like in person interview, meet a team member in person or like somebody else mentioned pick a laptop in person. That was one of the ways I spotted fake openings from real ones, aside from the typical company reposting the same job for months. reply",

In a fit of pique, I submitted to one with everything typewritten using an Olympia SG3, and for the other I wrote out everything longhand. With a fountain pen. In cursive. It took me nearly 3 days. I should have scanned it in for posterity, because it looked like a government treaty from the 1890s. Gorgeous, but doubtful that anyone under the age of 45 could even read it, and almost certainly that anyone under the age of 35 couldn’t. I even did a wax seal on the back fold of the envelope. Obviously, neither produced any sort of a response, because mail-in Resumes are typical of companies that are trying to justify foreign workers. If the barriers to application are stupidly high, then of course they won’t have any domestic applications and will need to find foreign (and much cheaper) applicants. reply",

I think it is more about people who use grammar as a means to attack and discredit a person, rather than the ideas presented. It can be used as an ad-hominem attack. I think the other part of it, which is not trivial, is the rise of phones. People are typing on little keyboard and auto-correct can have a heavy hand. People don’t want to be judged for auto-correct getting one word wrong, invalidating a legitimate argument, so they look past potential auto-correct mistakes from others. The Internet has become much more tolerant of misspelling and mistakes, for better or worse. If it’s a clear knowledge gap, then think a correction is helpful and warranted. For example someone saying “mute point” or “per say”. By all means, let them know. Ironically, auto-correct fixed both of those and I had to go out of my way to mess them up again. reply",

It seems to not understand well-known (eg for me, .Net) libraries as well as it should, and I have had to download the library source from github and instruct it to read the library to know how to use it; it does not follow instructions as well; it frequently assures me something is fixed but sometimes has forgotten a key portion; and it frequently ignores its memory: for example, it commits even with a stored memory instruction to never commit without me verifying it first. It's starting to be a real time drag and I am not getting the productivity I did even a short time ago. Is anyone else seeing this?</div>",

But I've always viewed LLM code with skepticism and rewrite a lot of it. As someone who's mainly .Net/Typescript I'm not seeing it be terrible with libraries, but it's generally bad when libraries constantly change their API. React Router for example. So depends what libraries you're using. We use MaterialUI and trying to get it to consitently use the new Grid definition is an exercise in futility. Do you know about the context 7 MCP, that can help apparently though I've not really bothered with it myself. Not sure how many .Net libraries they have. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Recent [\"self-propagating NPM malware\"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45260741) reminds us that the predominant security model is basically whack-a-mole: you gotta trust _every_ piece of software you run (including all the libraries, plugins, etc), unless you explicitly sandbox it.<p>Capability-based security might offer an alternative: software should not have access to things when it's not explicitly provided with access. I.e. \"classic\" desktop security is kind of a blacklist model (everything is possible unless explicitly restricted e.g. via sandbox) while capbility-based security is like a whitelist.<p>On a programming language level it's usually known as object-capability model, and there's a number of programming languages which implement it: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model<p>The question: why isn't it more popular? It doesn't even seem to be widely known, let alone used. (Aside from isolated examples.)<p>Is there any chance it would be widely adopted?<p>I guess one objection is that people don't want to manually configure security. But perhaps it can be integrated into normal UX if we really think about it: e.g. if you select a file using a system-provided file picker it would automatically grant access to that file, as access is explicitly authorized.</p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Let’s use Apple as an example, as they tend to do major transitions on a regular basis. So, let’s say that the top tier already approved the new security mode(l). Now, how to do it? My understanding is that most if not all APIs would have to be changed or replaced. So that's pretty much a new OS, that needs new apps (if the APIs change, you cannot simply recompile the apps). Now, if you expose the existing APIs to the new OS/apps, then what's the gain? And if you don't expose them, then you basically need a VM. I mean, I don’t know Darwin syscalls, but I suspect you might need new syscalls as well. And so you end up with a brand new OS that lives in a VM and has no apps. So it's likely order(s?) of magnitude more profitable to just harden the existing platforms. reply",

It's not a proper capability system, but it's still a security system that came after traditional Unix primitives.

So macOS programs can't navigate to ~/Photos without the user hitting allow, possibly in system preferences, not just as a pop-up. The external APIs themselves haven't changed.

          "text": "I had thought of some similar ideas, including the similar working of proxies, and I also had the same idea of how proxies could be used (although proxies have many other uses as well, not all of which are related to security), and also network transparency (which is also implemented by using proxies; it is not a feature that the kernel knows about). A program that receives a proxy does not know if it is a proxy or not (or what it is a proxy of); it can only send/receive messages. I also had similar idea like calling programs in the command shell, although in mine, a program cannot even return a value without being given a capability to send the result to (although there may be syntactic sugar to handle this without needing to write that explicitly), and the result will always be the same if any input it receives is the same (and in the same order); a capability is even required to determine the current date/time, etc. (One of the forks of a program file would specify the expected type of the initial message, which the command shell can use for type checking and related stuff like that.) Their \"vats\" are similar to my idea of how processes might be made, but different in many ways. A process consists of memory, which may include references to capabilities, and also includes the processing state. It does not necessarily use a event loop, although it can be implemented in that way. I did not consider using promises; I am unsure if it is necessary, which it might not be. However, my idea uses native code (with its own instruction set) rather than Guile or Scheme or Lisp, and system calls will be used for doing I/O with capabilities (and there aren't many system calls for doing other things than that). (Emulation would probably be possible (directly of the instruction set, or of the command shell and other higher-level stuff, or a combination), although I also have a different keyboard layout and other things different from existing systems.) Also, there are more things to be considered than related there. For example, nested transactions of multiple objects at once (even if they do not necessarily know each other), multiple locking, the hypertext file system model, etc. I also would not use JSON and would not use Unicode. reply",

Since then many architectural decisions of these operating systems weren't revised in order to avoid breaking backward-compatibility. Even if we need to break it to achieve better security, no one is ready to make such sacrifice. There are projects of operating systems with focus on security, which are not just Unix-like systems or Windows clones.

          "text": "I think that, if it is done well (which will require a new operating system design (and a new instruction set may also be helpful); I have many ideas), it will have more benefits than only security. It is much like the object-capability model described on Wikipedia, and it is neither a blacklist model nor a whitelist  model. A whitelist model would have a list (or other criteria) of what is permitted, but for a better capability-based system, it works differently. My idea involves capabilities (which can include proxy capabilities as well; i.e. it is not necessarily what you asked for, but you can send/receive messages anyways) which can be sent and used like the object-capability model, including as the initial message (instead of using command-line arguments, file descriptors, etc, it uses the \"initial message\"; this is like the \"initial conditions\" described on Wikipedia), which should include some capabilities otherwise it cannot do any I/O and will be automatically terminated (before the program gets a chance to run) if no debugger is attached. (Unlike the standard object-capability model, there is no \"endowment\" (at least at the level of the operating system, although programming languages might have this feature); the capability does nothing by itself, but the process that created it can receive messages that itself and/or other processes send to it and use them for whatever that capability is intended to mean.) Some benefits of a proxy capability system includes that many other things become unnecessary, since they can be done with proxies, such as: finer permissions than the capabilities normally allow, adding print preview to a program that does not have that feature (but that is able to print), simulating error conditions, testing if the date/time handling of a program would work correctly on February 29 (or some other date, or a leap second, etc) without needing to change the clock on your computer, accessing resources on another computer as though they are local (and vice-versa), etc. You might be able to pass capabilities using the command shell like how on UNIX you can use pipes, but in this one you would pass capabilities instead (as well as the ability to create your own). > I guess one objection is that people don't want to manually configure security. In many ways, reasonable defaults can be configured, and some things can be configured automatically, although it would still be possible to manually set them to whatever you want them to be. > if you select a file using a system-provided file picker it would automatically grant access to that file, as access is explicitly authorized Nevertheless, there are problems with such things, especially if you try to add them to existing systems. For example, a program might require access to additional files depending on the one accessed (either referenced by those files or by a modification of the original file's name (e.g. the journal file in SQLite)), configuration files and command-line arguments, etc. You would also need to consider such things as popen (many of my programs use it, with a command specified by the user at run time or specified in a configuration file). In a new operating system design you could also change the file system model as well, in order to help with this (I had ideas about how to do this, too). reply",

It got to the point where most of my code was written by an LLM. Eventually this tapered off week by week to the level it is now... which is literally 0. It's more effort to explain a problem to an LLM than it is to just think it through. I can't imagine I'm that special, just a year ahead of the curve. 2. The maintenance burden of code that has no real author is felt months/years after the code in written. Organizations then react a few months/years after that. 3. The quality is not getting better (see gpt 5) and the cost is not going down (see Claude Code, cursor, etc). Eventually the bills will come due and at the very least that will reduce the amount of code generated by an LLM. I very easily could be wrong, but I think there is hope and if anyone tells me \"it's the future\" I just hear \"it's the present\". No one knows what the future holds.

          "text": "I got sick of remote work by 2018. I quit freelancing, took on a full time job in hopes of just spending time with other humans. I wasn't the only one - co-working spaces just boomed and peaked in 2019 with WeWork. But after lockdown, 4/5 of the co-working spaces in my city shut down. The same people who did co-working spaces started their own businesses and would criticize remote work. Remote work basically went back to 2008 levels, even with new tech like Slack, Zoom, etc. Hybrid is probably best, but people overshot for no reason. I think with AI, if you were early enough to work with langchain, there's some hints that they tried writing langchain with AI. The architecture was all over the place. Some bits were overengineered. Context windows grew faster than the scaffolding that was designed to handle small context windows. GPT-5 is the lockdown event. You have the tech now to work fully with AI... it just stops being vibe, and starts being invasive. It's more judgemental. It changes code in a way you don't want it to. We'll probably be in a better place next year, but by then, people have lost their appetite for AI assistants. reply",

I can only provide useful feedback or alternatives if I can figure out why something was done, though. LLM-generating code has no unifying theory behind it - every line may as well have been written by a different person, so you get an utterly insane looking codebase with no constant thread tying it together and no reason why.

I still have the expectation of people being thoughtful and 'code craftspeople'. The only caveat is verbosity of code. It drives me up the wall how these models try to one-shot production code and put a lot of cruft in. I am starting to have the expectation of having to go in and pare down overly ambitious code to reduce complexity. I adopted LLM coding fairly early on (GPT3) and the difference between then and now is immense. It's a fast-moving technology still so I don't have the expectation that the model or tool I use today will be the one I use in 3 months. I have switched modalities and models pretty regularly to try to keep cutting edge and getting the best results. I think people who refuse to leverage LLMs for code generation to some degree are going to be left behind. It's going to be the equivalent, in my opinion, of keeping hard cover reference manuals on your desk versus using a search engine. reply",

For a lot of simple coding tasks (eg custom plugins or apps) an LLM is not only efficient, but extremely competent. Some traditional coders are having a harder time working with them when a major challenge comes from defining the problem and constraints well. It’s usually something kept in head. So, new skill sets are emerging and being refined. The ones that thrive here will not be coders, but it will be generalists with excellent management and communication skills. reply",

Luckily it does not struggle with me insisting the failure be for the right reason . (As opposed to failing because of a setup issue or a problem elsewhere in the code) When doing TDD with Claude Code I lean heavily on asking the agent two things: “can we watch it fail” and “does it fail for the right reason”. These questions are generic enough to sleepwalk through building most features and fixing all bugs. Yes I said all bugs. Reviewing the code is very pleasant because you get both the tests and production code and you can rely on the symmetry between them to understand the code’s intent and confirm that it does what it says. In my experience over multiple months of greenfield and brownfield work, Claude doing TDD produces code that is 100% the quality and clarity I’d have achieved had I built the thing myself, and it does it 100% of the time. Big part of that is because TDD compartmentalizes each task making it easy to avoid a single task having too much complexity. reply",

Maybe LLMs can't build you an enterprise back-end for thousands of users. But they sure as shit can make you a bespoke applet that easily tracks your garage sale items. LLMs really shine in greenfield <5k LOC programs. I think it's largely a mistake for devs to think that LLMs are made for them, rather than for enabling regular people to get far more mileage out of their computers. reply",
