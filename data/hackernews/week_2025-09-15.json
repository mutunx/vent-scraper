Burnout isn’t a flaw in your ability, it’s often the cost of high ownership in broken systems. Stepping away without notice sounds like survival, not weakness. On your questions:\nI believe portfolios matter less than signal. A solid GitHub readme, a tiny demo with personality, or even a clean writeup can open doors. Hiring today is noisy, clarity stands out more than size. AI hype is mostly wrappers + vibes. But that's a feature. If you can ship small, real tools that feel smart, you’re ahead. Nobody’s expecting you to train models. On staying engaged: what helped me was shipping for insight, not polish. Projects as questions, not proof. The goal isn’t “a finished app,” it’s “what did I just learn about what I love, hate, or want to do more of?” You clearly still care about the craft, about growth. That’s the rarest signal of all.

          "text": "I'm glad you made the commitment to change something in your life. Your previous job, and perhaps the way you approached it, was obviously not healthy. 1) The degree anxiety is understandable, but just in your head. I run a comp sci program for high schoolers as an replacement for universities. They don't get a degree but must learn how to signal they are capable. It's a skillset that most people don't learn until later in their careers. In your case, you likely have accumulated a number of valuable skills in your previous job. Since you haven't switched jobs, you haven't had much practice in communicating your skills to potential employers. Most engineers I know hate this, but it's sales/persuasion, and it's unavoidable and beneficial for you in the long-run. Take the perspective that you don't have a skill issue, but a signaling issue. 2) RE: AI - I would learn the fundamentals, only if you're interested in the engineering aspect of it, and implement some toy projects just to keep learning.  Try vibe coding, it's not going to kill you haha. Learn about its benefits and limitations so you can at least comment intelligently if it comes up. 3) Shipping projects is hard psychologically unless you've developed discipline or there are other constraints/deadlines. If I were you, I'd work on projects in a more social manner. That means building with other engineers, talking to people who would benefit from what you're building, or just helping out existing communities. The socialization would help keep your spirits up. It's also the best way to build relationships and open other opportunities. 4) Hiring/recruiting is going through big changes now, partially due to the rise of AI generated applications. Building trust via other channels is going to be much more important moving forward. We've had to more or less turn off all inbound hiring and rely on our vetted professional networks due to the massive glut of applications. Job search is brutal now, but it's just as bad on the hiring side. We're going through changes were the old methods don't work anymore, and the new haven't been figured out yet. Good luck! reply",

A degree isn't a finite indicator of a person's knowledge, capability, or achievements. 39 months after getting mine, I still haven't landed my first paid tech job to enter the industry, and I don't see that happening anytime soon, if ever. Granted, I haven't tried much in the past year, but it wasn't any better when I did. I once rejected the notion outright because, with obvious bias as a college student, I felt it invalidated everything I'd worked toward. But it's become apparent my degree meant nothing in the industry. On the contrary, you got a job and remained employed for 11 years. That piece of paper, or the lack thereof, didn't make a difference in what you experienced and accomplished. > I'm suffering from a lot of analysis paralysis trying to select a side project for a portfolio. How do you keep yourselves engaged with pet projects? My github is a field of projects 1/4 of the way completed before I lost steam on them. Personally I... don't. I started one of my projects back in August 2024. I made a homepage, UI, and a basic database schema... and then I blanked out on how to progress and hardly touched it for 11 months. I got some wind in my sails again in July - almost a full year later. A whole year of new experiences and insights, inside and out of the tech domain, led to better practices and features never conceived the first time around. So even if you're not coding or even looking at your project, who's to say you're not progressing with it? I read of this phenomenon in innovation called the S-curve, where advancements appear to occur rapidly in a short time due to a change in tech, paradigm, or process. Perhaps the next burst of progress simply requires time to find and cultivate through many seemingly insignificant insights gained from other experiences. No point in rushing through - if I'm not working on it, it's not the right time. That's also why I have like a billion (okay, more like 3-5) projects going. I hit a brick wall on one, so I work on something else where I have a clearer vision. Eventually, something triggers a flash of inspiration, and with a fresh mind, I can return and hit that burst of progress in the S-curve again. Eventually, I'll have many projects with lots of progress due to the staggered curves. Conceptualizing a whole project is daunting, too. Too many bells and whistles lead to a paralyzing spiral of overthinking and self-doubt. Everything has to be perfect and fleshed out. But the mantra of \"done is better than perfect\" rings true. Once there's a solid foundation, it's much easier to incrementally improve the project, rather than trying to get it right in one go, and eventually reach what was envisioned. I find it important to remember why I started a project in the first place. With my own imposter syndrome, I always gravitated toward doing what was considered best practices to be a \"real software engineer.\" I could never do right by myself, so I overcomplicated the tech stack and implementations to hell, following the words of others, trying to prove myself. If it wasn't complex and grueling, I wasn't doing anything worthwhile. However, I eventually reminded myself that the code is the least important part of my software project. I never started a project to have code, but to address a personally close issue or fulfill an itch. If the project addresses that goal, then why does it matter if the load times aren't perfectly optimized? Why does it matter if it doesn't scale to millions of users when I haven't even gotten 1 yet? Who cares if it's not \"impressive\" enough to hypothetical people I've never seen? Implementation has its considerations, but shouldn't be to the point of blocking all progress. Certainly not to where working on the project isn't fulfilling anymore. So, sometimes, after a long paralysis, I yell at myself mentally to, quote, \"Just freakin' do it already, for the love of everything holy, just write the fudging thing- [insert more aggressive self-yelling]\" , overriding my thoughts to do without that pesky thinking. But yeah, those are my accounts with those challenges. Good luck wherever the future takes you! reply",

You have to be impressive enough for a callback, then a possible tech screen where you write code in coderpad or something, then some combination of coding, behavioral, and architectural interviews almost always done virtually. lots of people practice on leetcode, I recommend everyone at least practice the common easier questions and solving them quickly.  The medium and hard ones are worth the investment if you're going for big tech, but maybe less important for startups that all have their own style of interviews (that vary quite a bit). Startups and no name medium sized companies can be random.  Some have collaborative coding, some copy big tech, some just talk to you, some look at portfolio projects or give take home assignments, anything and everything here. > How important is it to have a visable portfolio of working projects? Much less important than having recognizable names on the resume, and also less important than having contributions to known Open Source projects. I highly recommend putting time into existing well known projects (Apache, anything done from Meta/facebook/Google etc), and trying to get a PR accepted, than hacking away on your own project. Every senior in college has an extensive portfolio of projects on their github, it's very hard to tell how much was copied or how good it is. A much better signal is someone who can deal with the intricacies of an existing gargantuan codebase, go back and forth in PR comments, follow a style guide, work with maintainers, take criticism, have clear communication, and see something through (That may take a while!). > How much of the AI hype is HN nerds nerding out about AI versus actually implementing AI, versus gluing AI apis together? Eh, for me, AI has been amazing at teaching me a new PL, and porting small bits of code. It's been helpful for writing unit tests, getting scaffolding going, etc. but sometimes incomplete. It's been on rare occasions able to solve a bug for me. that's about it.  YMMV. Source - no degree, senior engineer at Google.  Also spent 10+ years working at shit companies and doing open source before getting a chance at bigger more well known companies, then doing that for ~8 until I could work my way into getting FAANG interviews. reply",

My last job was as a contract research engineer doing AI safety work at Redwood Research. I spent about half my time on our synthetic datasets of safe & unsafe LLM behavior, and the other half on fancy finetuning. I finetuned an LLM to exhibit unsafe behavior while fooling logistic probes trained to detect it, but only in deployment. Weird multi-part composite loss. My other big project is independent research in text-to-image models that are trained solely on unlabeled image data, exploiting CLIP embeddings for the link between text and images. Currently fighting with spherical flow matching models and racing the ICLR paper deadline. If you need help getting ML systems up and running, getting them fast and correct, or if any of that stuff sounds interesting to you, get in touch. reply",

I do well with detail-oriented work. I have 14.7k reputation on StackOverflow and have answered over 300 questions there, mostly on .NET-related topics. (The link to my SO profile is on my CV.) I'm looking for a senior full stack or senior backend role. I was unable to work following issues during the pandemic, which are now resolved, but I'm rarely getting to talk with anyone to be considered for interviews; AI rejects my CV outright. I'm stuck in an algorithmic prison. Despite the length of break, my knowledge is current. If you need convincing of that, I recently got through the whole interview process at Moneybox for a senior backend role, which is pretty much the only interview I've had. Although they hired someone else, they spent a week trying to allocate extra budget to hire me. Unfortunately, that didn't happen, and so here I am. If you aren't hiring, but know someone who is, I'd appreciate you sharing my details with them. I can start straight away. If anyone has any advice to help break out of the AI auto rejections, I'd also appreciate it if you'd contact me via email. Thanks for reading. reply",

It would be amazing to have some device similar to classig Palm Pilot, \"handheld PDA\". Maybe even with stylus, 4\"-5\" touchscreen that easily fits anywhere. Are there any similar devices available? Tablets are way too large and are using same closed mobile ecosystems.</div>",

It won't be near as smooth as PalmOS, but if you're into hacking a little bit, it might be worth looking at. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPQ2q7yVjZs I've seen some other people hack together similarly devices. One was a Raspberry Pi 0 with a blackberry keyboard and a screen. Anything off the shelf and even remotely polished these days is likely running Android, which seems like it would defeat the purpose. The are Remarkable Move might be an option, if you're looking more for a notebook to organize everything, but if you want a Palm-like experience, that will also miss the mark. You could try for an old Palm or Handspring device off eBay. It might be its own island, or getting in syncing could be a project. You can run old Palm ROMS on smartphones. I tried it, but once the nostalgia wore off in 5 minutes I gave up on it. It also seems to defeat the purpose of what you're going for. reply",

For server-hosted: mostly just security bugs and working around phone cache. > reliability and predictability For phone-hosted: you'll never have all your data, you are constantly dependant on apps tradeoffs or outright availability (even my train schedule app stopped supporting my phone OS, amazing), phone theft or broken or other loss. For server-hosted: All your data, apps you control, always able to write your own additional tool and deploy whenever you want, reliable backups, against rare no network access. >  wanting to avoid setting up accounts For phone-hosted: Indeed more and more difficult to deploy your own apps (because accounts and hoops to jump). For server-hosted: what accounts? My server my accounts. You rarely need something like an additional remote server (which even then would be less constrained than a phone developer account - and probably cheaper.) > space (you didn't mention this one) Server-hosted is much cheaper space than on the phone (at the tradeoff of transfer speed). > development hurdles (you didn't mention this one) Gone! Free as the wind! Whatever tool, whatever \"pratices\", no gatekeepers, update when you want either standard software or your own - or postpone updates when the situation demands. Absurdly simpler development. All yours. So anyway, my point is that the original attractiveness of hosting a private-data personal app on the phone has changed. (1) that has been made harder - and less private, while (2) access of your home server has become MUCH better. reply",

Komodo Health is fixing that—with data. We’ve mapped the patient journey across the country to build the most complete picture of disease burden and treatment gaps. Our customers are pharma, payers, and health systems who actually want to do something meaningful with that information. We have an exciting product, marmot, that is AI-native, both in the interface as well as in development, and want to carefully grow high productivity teams around this offering. AI integrated with Komodo's data is giving some of the most unique, real world insights any of us has seen come out of the new LLM era. Our product was just featured on Times Sqaure too! https://www.linkedin.com/posts/komodo-health_last-week-our-d... We are looking for highly independent individuals, who can work in a new, small, but empowered team. What will you be bringing? - Proven experience working on Agentic systems that solve real problems OR Some evidence you have the \"instinct\" Andrew Ng mentions as the differentiators of successful Agent builders. We also take full ownership of the product, so experience+readiness for fullstack development is a must. Core ML experience is not required and for this position, not relevant at all. The new LLM/Agent era is... different. Perks will include annual conference trip, periodic travel to SF/NY for on-site, Executive Coaching, etc. If this post sounds exciting, please apply at https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/komodohealth/jobs/806961600... (mention HN as the source). Please note, we can only consider applicants who are already in the US. If you wish, please also email me at ramraj.velmurugan@komodohealth.com with an example of how you have figured out that instinct I mention above.",

If you also get a bunch of data breach mailers in your mail box every year, you're familiar with the impact of security breaches at tech companies. We're trying to put a stop to that by helping companies understand their risk and mitigate it. HQ is in Ann Arbor, MI, but we're all over the US. We're looking for a Senior SRE to help improve reliability and developer experience, and a Staff Software Engineer to join our Attack Surface Management product team. If you're a little bit more senior or junior than either of the postings, please do still apply. We care a lot more about getting the right people than we do matching the level exactly to the posting. Please please apply to these role if: - You can take ownership of improving a part of the product (Staff SWE) or the application platform we build for product engineers (SRE). - You're game to navigate the messy middle of a small, nimble company with really high customer expectations. You'll have to navigate some ambiguity to be successful in either of these roles - don't expect pristine PRDs coming down from on high.

Our primary cloud is in GCP and we also maintain our own physical servers (prior experience with physical hardware is great, but not required).

          "text": "Y Combinator (yes, the people who run this site) | Full stack web and AI | San Francisco | Onsite | Fulltime YC itself hires software engineers from time to time.  Many people don't know that YC has a small but very important software team.  We run several websites - not just this one, but also workatastartup.com (the main way YC companies hire), a social network for YC founders, and the core infrastructure that YC itself runs on. Recently, we've been spending most of our time building our own AI agents.  Over the last year, YC has mostly funded AI agent companies, so it's been cool to go really deep building our own AI agents too.  We're building agents to automate every aspect of what we do, and pushing the limits of what's possible with the current models to do it. An unusual aspect of being on the YC software team is that you'll get full access to the YC program, founders and partners.  The YC batch runs in the same building we work out of, so there are talks with famous founders happening most nights, right downstairs in our building.  If you want to start a startup someday, working at YC would be an excellent jumping off point - several YC companies have come from team members who decided to start their own company. YC works fully in-person in SF. We're happy to help you move here if you're in the US already.  Unfortunately we can't sponsor new visas, but we're happy to transfer existing ones. YC offers highly competitive compensation and benefits. You can apply online ( https://www.ycombinator.com/careers ) or just email me at jared@ycombinator.com reply",

What: We’re building an autonomous maritime network — think distributed systems in the ocean—extending resilient comms, sensing and compute to the edge in high-threat remote environments. Who we are looking for: - Software Engineers: large-scale distributed systems, networking, system design, embedded software, DevOps rollouts. Python, C++, Rust. Bonus: SDR, mesh, security. - Electrical Engineers: PCB layout, embedded, RF, circuits, power/batteries, electro-mechanical. Bonus: DSP. - Marine/Mechanical Engineers: pressure vessels, subsea robotics, gliders, ruggedized design; DFM, reliability, field deployment. You will: ship code to robots, test on the water, move fast, own big surface area, and work directly with military operators. About Us: Our founding team includes a Navy SEAL veteran, defense industry engineers, builders, hackers, and watermen (sailors, boaters, divers, fishermen). We’re focused on real future missions — not legacy requirements. Venture-backed; public launch soon. Eligibility for a TS/SCI security clearance is a plus.

Our primary strength is functioning as a data marketplace where we differentiate ourselves by automatically standardizing data, \nmaking platform data accessible through the Narrative Query Language (NQL), \ngiving data providers the ability to define row-level access and pricing policies, \nand making it easy to deliver data to a variety of destinations using our \"Connector Framework\". We operate two flavours of our platform: An AWS-based implementation that runs on our infrastructure, \nand a Snowflake-based version running inside the user's Snowflake account. We are a small, remote-first team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch. \nWhile the company's headquarters are in NYC, the development team currently includes engineers working from the US (California and New York), \nCanada (Alberta, British Columbia, and Québec), Poland, and Serbia. In brief, the technologies we use are: - Backend: Scala, Spark, Apache Iceberg, Apache Calcite, Cats, Cats-Effect, Http4s, FS2, Doobie, Deequ, Axolotl, BentoML, and HuggingFace Transformers. - Frontend: Typescript, VueJS, Nuxt, Vite, and Cloudflare Pages. - Operations: AWS (ECR, ECS, EMR, RDS, S3, etc.), Datadog, Docker, Terraform, with some burgeoning use of EKS/Kubernetes.

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Does anyone know of good resources to make your own animatronic Halloween displays?<p>I'm a software engineer, and not skilled in hardware per se.<p>I would love to make some things together with my kids. For reference, they are 8, 10, 12 and VERY smart and they use Ubuntu as their desktop computers and can use flatpak from the command line. Not that I am bragging....<p>And, I would love to NOT spent $400 on just a single ridiculous junky thing from Lowes, and do that for multiple things. My budget is definitely tiny and the journey of building and troubleshooting is what I want for the kids, not necessarily a finished perfect project.<p>I found this site and it looks interesting but I am unsure how well this would work for someone like me and whether I would be able to get it working. The site says \"Only 54 days until Halloween!\"<p>https://www.frightprops.com/pneumatics.html<p>If anyone knows of good projects on GitHub, please let me know?</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

It is largely not different than a \"custom\" setup because it's always some patched together job of various plugins to the point that it becomes brittle and difficult to work with. I get the sense that technical people think it is more straightforward and prescribe it to people, but any non-technical person I've worked with is utterly lost in it. I don't think the LLMs change the argument either. If anything, dealing with the complexities of wordpress could make it even more difficult without someone who knows what they're doing. Somewhere around 15 years ago, I thought wordpress was viable, but I think we need to leave it in the dust. I worked with it again 5 years ago, and the situation was no different from what I could tell. reply",

If you are just being an unofficial middle man between a SaaS and your customer you are going to make very little money.  Its essentially uber for tech, you are going to be bearing the burden of all the implementation friction.  On top of that you are acting as an uncommissioned sales person for the SaaS while they collect income indefinitely from your work. The difference in how you setup the deal is literally millions of dollars in the real life example I mentioned.  I don't care about corporations.  I want HN posters to make money for their work and skills rather than be used and tossed in the trash by corporations.  Guess what?  The company is still in business and doing fine.  The owner just gets one less lambo per year and a developer gets to feed their family. Its also worth mentioning the obvious only reason they still pay the small consultancy is that they are constantly asking for changes and new things.  Why would you want the extra overhead of working in someone elses sandbox when you have to do all the work anyway.  Might as well be on your terms if you are going to do the work. reply",

Currently having 20+ sites running this setup for clients and never hit an issue \"modeling\" the data as Decap config, widgets (also custom ones), can allow pretty much anything. One downside for this setup, is that uploaded media are not re-sized or compressed (since there is no backend job doing it), so a client must be briefed into \"making smaller images\" (on the web client side with squoosh.app[2] for example), or using a SSG that does that built-in (hugo, gatsby) 0. https://github.com/sveltia 1. https://decapcms.org/docs/gitlab-backend/#client-side-pkce-a... 2. https://squoosh.app reply",

A couple years later, the dev moves on, and the client has no way to update their site with new features or sections, and no way to fix it if anything breaks. And we have to explain to them what headless is and why they're in this situation. It sucks for everyone involved. Go with a regular CMS, like Wix or Squarespace or WordPress. The $10 or $20 a month is still cheaper than having to pay a dev later to fix their broken headless site with old deprecated packages and frameworks that nobody uses anymore. Headless is a developer optimization, not a client feature. It only makes sense if the dev is a part of the customer's own team, or in an ongoing agency relationship with them. It's a poor fit for freelancers and volunteers because the client ends up with essentially abandonware. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Recent [\"self-propagating NPM malware\"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45260741) reminds us that the predominant security model is basically whack-a-mole: you gotta trust _every_ piece of software you run (including all the libraries, plugins, etc), unless you explicitly sandbox it.<p>Capability-based security might offer an alternative: software should not have access to things when it's not explicitly provided with access. I.e. \"classic\" desktop security is kind of a blacklist model (everything is possible unless explicitly restricted e.g. via sandbox) while capbility-based security is like a whitelist.<p>On a programming language level it's usually known as object-capability model, and there's a number of programming languages which implement it: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model<p>The question: why isn't it more popular? It doesn't even seem to be widely known, let alone used. (Aside from isolated examples.)<p>Is there any chance it would be widely adopted?<p>I guess one objection is that people don't want to manually configure security. But perhaps it can be integrated into normal UX if we really think about it: e.g. if you select a file using a system-provided file picker it would automatically grant access to that file, as access is explicitly authorized.</p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I don't know much (if anything) about it, but it can be turned into an interesting thought experiment. Let’s use Apple as an example, as they tend to do major transitions on a regular basis. So, let’s say that the top tier already approved the new security mode(l). Now, how to do it? My understanding is that most if not all APIs would have to be changed or replaced. So that's pretty much a new OS, that needs new apps (if the APIs change, you cannot simply recompile the apps). Now, if you expose the existing APIs to the new OS/apps, then what's the gain? And if you don't expose them, then you basically need a VM. I mean, I don’t know Darwin syscalls, but I suspect you might need new syscalls as well. And so you end up with a brand new OS that lives in a VM and has no apps. So it's likely order(s?) of magnitude more profitable to just harden the existing platforms. reply",

Back in 70s and 80s computers didn't contain valuable information to care about and there was no Internet to transmit such information. So, adding some sort of security elements in operating systems had no sense. In these years modern operating system were first developed - Unix, Dos, Windows. Since then many architectural decisions of these operating systems weren't revised in order to avoid breaking backward-compatibility. Even if we need to break it to achieve better security, no one is ready to make such sacrifice. There are projects of operating systems with focus on security, which are not just Unix-like systems or Windows clones. But they can't replace existing operating systems because of network effects (it's unpractical to use a system nobody else uses). reply",

          "text": "> I am not very familiar with 'slicer' software yet. and > durable, temperature/chemical resistant materials such as PC/Nylon/ABS or infused materials. are a little cart-before-horse. This is like asking what ink-and-paper printer to buy for making complex, multi-format printed books to specific criteria, while admitting that you've not used any form of publishing software or understand any of the non-software processes involved in making a book. The slicer is by far your most important tool for _effective_ 3D printing with a variety of materials, moreso than CAD or 3D modeling. Get a cheaper, more plug-and-play printer that doesn't meet all of your criteria, and focus on learning how to effectively use its slicer. Print basic things, experiment, and force and make hands-on mistakes with it on relatively forgiving PLA/PETG. Do these _before_ jumping up to a pricier, fully enclosed machine _and also_ before printing harder-to-use materials, each of which will add new difficulties. You don't want your first hotend blob to happen on a decent machine that you actually like while using a material that's difficult or dangerous to deal with. A Sovol SV06 or SV08 meets most of your criteria at about 1/3 to 1/2 of your budget; I haven't had the best experiences with their reliability but they fit many of your criteria. Used Creality Enders might be even cheaper depending on where you are, and while also fussy are hackable and repairable to the point of often being used as platforms for entirely different printers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmMW6_7lrlQ reply",

          "text": "I agree in principle with the above comment, but for some additional context - slicer software has gotten really, really good these days. Especially (sadly) if you don't need open source software. To make a CNC machining metaphor - Slicer software is basically just your interface to the dials and knobs on the CNC settings for speeds and feeds. There's more settings, because 3d printing is more like if a CNC had a baby with a welder and an injection molding press, only it's injecting and simultaneously welding up a blob of plastic. You're balancing the toolpaths, the temps, the adhesion, and the overall speed all at the same time, all for whatever material you're using. So it's complex, but these companies have a ton of data and experience in order to make sure their preset settings are damn good out of the box. And these days, they get it right more often than they get it wrong! Long story short - you should probably just get a Bambu. You'll learn what you need to learn from it, while having good quality output the whole time. If you find out it's not suitable for what you're looking to do, then you can sell it used with decent resale and get the best printer for your specific application. reply",

Potentially a lot of work unless you're interested in 3D printing itself as a hobby rather than as a tool. Prusa Core One would be a bit more complete OOTB.  It is 220mm in the smallest axis (Y) though.  Slicer and firmware are open source, but the hardware is not (unlike previous Prusa printers). Bambu gives you the same capability for much less, but the firmware is not open source (third party open source firmware does exist).  I believe the stock firmware also has to \"phone home\" at least once before it can be used offline. Even cheaper are less-well known Chinese companies, like Qidi.  Firmware is usually a proprietary fork of Klipper or other open source projects; some people have had success flashing the mainline version. reply",

Amazon and few others have taken up on themselves to make life of their sellers easier by handling taxes for them, especially for EU, but i see no reason for it whatsoever. Businesses should be businesses and handle their own taxes and legal obligations by themselves. Additionally, if you get involved in between the seller and the buyer, YOU are now liable when it comes to taxes, as you become de-facto the seller, you have to handle returns/refunds(including the tax aspect and have to handle already paid taxes in such cases as well), audits and other legal aspects. There is simply no good reason why you should involve yourself in this whatsoever. Just facilitate the business transaction, but not the financial transaction. reply",

Most of the time the learning happens along the way, not necessarily in the solution itself but all the things you try and iterate on your journey to the solution. Everything changes in tech by the minute ... but also nothing changes. For web applications it has been HTML, CSS and JS for nearly 30 years. XMLHttpRequest/AJAX came out 25+ years ago. There have been many improvements along the way, like applying design patterns instead of cgi-bin directories with scripts that had a +x modifier on them in the file system. But the base technologies have not changed all that much. We still submit HTML form's with input fields to a back-end server that handles that data. We're still rendering HTML and using CSS to style it. Gone are custom UI toolkits like Flash or Java Applets. Maybe WASM is something to look into but it feels like its not mainstream to me. If you don't want to get left behind, learn the basic building blocks at a deep level, they don't change much. reply",

I’ve embraced that I cannot direct which topic my self-directed learning will take up and sustain (almost none of which ends up going toward tech stuff, aside from a span of some years in my teens and early 20s—and all of that was motivated by wanting to accomplish specific things with computers) and rely on assignments to motivate me for career-relevant learning. I’ll learn whatever it takes to get the job done. Then stop, because I don’t actually care about the tech per se , most of the time, and trying to force myself to learn “just because” does nothing but make me miserable and waste time. This isn’t even “how I approach learning as a generalist”, it’s how I became a generalist . My interest in continuing to fiddle with stuff after the job’s done is basically zero. My experience has been that it takes amazingly little effort to be above-median among practitioners at a lot of things. How many React developers have spent one entire hour reading through the core logic of React itself? How many people working with LLMs have read the Attention Is All You Need paper? How many people read about the disk storage layout of a database they’ve been told to use? It’s way less than half. It takes so very little to stand out. reply",

Never in my life have I made an active decision to stop learning about any one thing. You learn whatever skill is required to deal with the problem at hand and go on keep learning until you need a new skill or just get distracted. But also you're making an extremely bad mistake in your thinking here. Being a generalist does not preclude being a master. In fact, I've found that in today's market you must have specializations. Right now I'm selling myself as an electronics engineer and embedded C programmer. But my deepest expertice is C#, where I consider myself to be a fairly high level expert. My current job is writing react native with some EE on the side. You're trying to actively spread yourself even thinner which is a huge error. Knowing almost nothing about everything is not useful today, we just use AI for that. You need some real, solid skills to work from. You also need to be able to be a specialist and do specialist work because you are not likely to find a good generalist role. There aren't many such roles and they're getting harder to find. But all in all my answer is no. There is no point where you should stop learning any one thing. Follow your passions and what's interesting. Finding a subject you're interested in and spending a ton of time learning about it isn't a bad thing. That's how you figure out what you like and how you build real skills. You should follow particular subjects into mastery because a generalist without any specialization is not actually very useful unless you're a world class engineer. It's clichéd, but genuinely follow whatever subjects make you happy and find a way to make that work for you. reply",

What I'm saying is that specialization is not antithetical to generalization. A good generalist should have areas of expertise because we can't cover everything .

          "text": "TBH it's very difficult to gauge when to stop pursuing something. Personally, I learn something up until it stops becoming useful and/or it starts becoming more of a burden on my mental overhead. Doesn't mean I'm never going to go back to it, it just means I accomplished what I needed to do with the minimum amount of knowledge. From there on out it is entirely dependent on how much the topic interested me. Most of the time I'll end up going back to a topic anyways since making things isn't just about designing and creating the thing, it's also maintaining it. At that point it's more about whether or not you can pursue a project due to it's knowledge requirements, but I believe that falls out of the bounds of your question. This is my rule of thumb: Learn what you need to know first for your task at hand. If your curiosity can't be contained, make a mental note. If that mental note doesn't go anywhere and you keep dwelling on the thought of it, pursue it until your curiosity is satisfied. If done successfully, repeat. You COULD write it down, but if you're anything like me you'll just end up with a desk filled to the brim with post it notes and never actually going back to 90% of those topics. Which kills a lot of trees. If you're into that sorta thing, don't let me stop you. Making a mental note is much better since if the topic is of interest to you, then you will not forget about it. Therefore, you'll let your curiosity build up until you cannot contain yourself and have to learn more about the topic. NOTE:\nBeing a generalist usually comes because of a deep sense of curiosity in a wide range of topics. Take your time and enjoy the process of learning things since that will guarantee the longevity of your curiosity without burnout. reply",

It is good to be aware of some tech/capabilities but learning it only for the sake of learning it is a waste of time as if anything that you do not use, you forget. For example, you can learn 70% of features of a new language you are picking up and that will get you through 99% of your time. There is absolutely no need to learn the remaining 30% of the features that you'll never use. So in short, learn what you need, but be aware of the options in case you might have a use case for some of them in the future in which case you will know where to look and what to learn. reply",

Going out of my way to dive deep on something I will never use seems like a waste of time to me. My company sent me to Citrix training years ago. I was going to get certified, but didn’t end up doing it. The class and certification seem designed for someone setting up the entire Citrix infra for their company. In my role, I just made a publish app here and there, which I already knew how to do. After the training, our use of Citrix went down, and I haven’t touched it at all in 10 years. I’m glad I didn’t waste my time deep diving on technology I’d never actually use. If we use it again in the future, I’ll have to re-learn it either way, since it’s been so long. I go beyond on topics I actually find interesting, or seem like they will be relevant to my job for a longer period of time, where I will see some pay off. reply",

Later, when we added a driver, we brought in a driver expert to implement the driver, and I worked on how it integrated into the product.

They say 10,000 hours to become an expert, but that's brute forced learning. When you actually learn how to learn, what universities USED TO teach and have since stopped teaching, you can do it much quicker. People who know how to learn can become an expert in under 1000 hours. >In 2025, with everything in tech changing by the minute, I’m realizing I need to set boundaries about how deep I go on any particular topic. But I’m unsure how. Particularly if I don’t want to get left behind as things continue to evolve. that's the wrong way to approach it; or perhaps definition of depth? Depth to me is about a subject that cant be understood until certain other learning milestones have been learnt. Which is perhaps a depth, but also something you can force as something new. A new pattern that will as above be part of the learning. It's fine to go deep, so long as you're seeing a new pattern you cant predict. The limit isnt about depth, it's about seeing something new. reply",

          "text": "Practicality puts bounds on how much to rabbit hole. A theoretician in the purest sense is removed from practical constraints and timelines. He can, in principle, keep pursuing a subject until the day he dies. A practitioner is aiming for a practical result within a time frame. Because he has to deliver, he cannot afford to focus on developing a deep or exhaustive grasp of any particular thing. His focus isn't knowledge, after all, but the practical result. He will lean more on what he already knows, however limited, rather than pursuing new knowledge. He is less concerned with verifying the truth of claims himself and more concerned with trusting claims tactically by knowing whom to trust and when. So, in the capacity of practitioner, you must learn prudence, which is the virtue of knowing what should be done in a given situation. It is the basis for the moral life, as morality concerns itself with right action and right decision making. reply",

          "text": "I'm glad you made the commitment to change something in your life. Your previous job, and perhaps the way you approached it, was obviously not healthy. 1) The degree anxiety is understandable, but just in your head. I run a comp sci program for high schoolers as an replacement for universities. They don't get a degree but must learn how to signal they are capable. It's a skillset that most people don't learn until later in their careers. In your case, you likely have accumulated a number of valuable skills in your previous job. Since you haven't switched jobs, you haven't had much practice in communicating your skills to potential employers. Most engineers I know hate this, but it's sales/persuasion, and it's unavoidable and beneficial for you in the long-run. Take the perspective that you don't have a skill issue, but a signaling issue. 2) RE: AI - I would learn the fundamentals, only if you're interested in the engineering aspect of it, and implement some toy projects just to keep learning.  Try vibe coding, it's not going to kill you haha. Learn about its benefits and limitations so you can at least comment intelligently if it comes up. 3) Shipping projects is hard psychologically unless you've developed discipline or there are other constraints/deadlines. If I were you, I'd work on projects in a more social manner. That means building with other engineers, talking to people who would benefit from what you're building, or just helping out existing communities. The socialization would help keep your spirits up. It's also the best way to build relationships and open other opportunities. 4) Hiring/recruiting is going through big changes now, partially due to the rise of AI generated applications. Building trust via other channels is going to be much more important moving forward. We've had to more or less turn off all inbound hiring and rely on our vetted professional networks due to the massive glut of applications. Job search is brutal now, but it's just as bad on the hiring side. We're going through changes were the old methods don't work anymore, and the new haven't been figured out yet. Good luck! reply",

On your questions:\nI believe portfolios matter less than signal. A solid GitHub readme, a tiny demo with personality, or even a clean writeup can open doors. Hiring today is noisy, clarity stands out more than size. AI hype is mostly wrappers + vibes. But that's a feature. If you can ship small, real tools that feel smart, you’re ahead. Nobody’s expecting you to train models. On staying engaged: what helped me was shipping for insight, not polish. Projects as questions, not proof. The goal isn’t “a finished app,” it’s “what did I just learn about what I love, hate, or want to do more of?” You clearly still care about the craft, about growth. That’s the rarest signal of all.

          "text": ">- What are interviews like these days? Big tech is pretty standard.  You have to be impressive enough for a callback, then a possible tech screen where you write code in coderpad or something, then some combination of coding, behavioral, and architectural interviews almost always done virtually. lots of people practice on leetcode, I recommend everyone at least practice the common easier questions and solving them quickly.  The medium and hard ones are worth the investment if you're going for big tech, but maybe less important for startups that all have their own style of interviews (that vary quite a bit). Startups and no name medium sized companies can be random.  Some have collaborative coding, some copy big tech, some just talk to you, some look at portfolio projects or give take home assignments, anything and everything here. > How important is it to have a visable portfolio of working projects? Much less important than having recognizable names on the resume, and also less important than having contributions to known Open Source projects. I highly recommend putting time into existing well known projects (Apache, anything done from Meta/facebook/Google etc), and trying to get a PR accepted, than hacking away on your own project. Every senior in college has an extensive portfolio of projects on their github, it's very hard to tell how much was copied or how good it is. A much better signal is someone who can deal with the intricacies of an existing gargantuan codebase, go back and forth in PR comments, follow a style guide, work with maintainers, take criticism, have clear communication, and see something through (That may take a while!). > How much of the AI hype is HN nerds nerding out about AI versus actually implementing AI, versus gluing AI apis together? Eh, for me, AI has been amazing at teaching me a new PL, and porting small bits of code. It's been helpful for writing unit tests, getting scaffolding going, etc. but sometimes incomplete. It's been on rare occasions able to solve a bug for me. that's about it.  YMMV. Source - no degree, senior engineer at Google.  Also spent 10+ years working at shit companies and doing open source before getting a chance at bigger more well known companies, then doing that for ~8 until I could work my way into getting FAANG interviews. reply",

A degree isn't a finite indicator of a person's knowledge, capability, or achievements. 39 months after getting mine, I still haven't landed my first paid tech job to enter the industry, and I don't see that happening anytime soon, if ever. Granted, I haven't tried much in the past year, but it wasn't any better when I did. I once rejected the notion outright because, with obvious bias as a college student, I felt it invalidated everything I'd worked toward. But it's become apparent my degree meant nothing in the industry. On the contrary, you got a job and remained employed for 11 years. That piece of paper, or the lack thereof, didn't make a difference in what you experienced and accomplished. > I'm suffering from a lot of analysis paralysis trying to select a side project for a portfolio. How do you keep yourselves engaged with pet projects? My github is a field of projects 1/4 of the way completed before I lost steam on them. Personally I... don't. I started one of my projects back in August 2024. I made a homepage, UI, and a basic database schema... and then I blanked out on how to progress and hardly touched it for 11 months. I got some wind in my sails again in July - almost a full year later. A whole year of new experiences and insights, inside and out of the tech domain, led to better practices and features never conceived the first time around. So even if you're not coding or even looking at your project, who's to say you're not progressing with it? I read of this phenomenon in innovation called the S-curve, where advancements appear to occur rapidly in a short time due to a change in tech, paradigm, or process. Perhaps the next burst of progress simply requires time to find and cultivate through many seemingly insignificant insights gained from other experiences. No point in rushing through - if I'm not working on it, it's not the right time. That's also why I have like a billion (okay, more like 3-5) projects going. I hit a brick wall on one, so I work on something else where I have a clearer vision. Eventually, something triggers a flash of inspiration, and with a fresh mind, I can return and hit that burst of progress in the S-curve again. Eventually, I'll have many projects with lots of progress due to the staggered curves. Conceptualizing a whole project is daunting, too. Too many bells and whistles lead to a paralyzing spiral of overthinking and self-doubt. Everything has to be perfect and fleshed out. But the mantra of \"done is better than perfect\" rings true. Once there's a solid foundation, it's much easier to incrementally improve the project, rather than trying to get it right in one go, and eventually reach what was envisioned. I find it important to remember why I started a project in the first place. With my own imposter syndrome, I always gravitated toward doing what was considered best practices to be a \"real software engineer.\" I could never do right by myself, so I overcomplicated the tech stack and implementations to hell, following the words of others, trying to prove myself. If it wasn't complex and grueling, I wasn't doing anything worthwhile. However, I eventually reminded myself that the code is the least important part of my software project. I never started a project to have code, but to address a personally close issue or fulfill an itch. If the project addresses that goal, then why does it matter if the load times aren't perfectly optimized? Why does it matter if it doesn't scale to millions of users when I haven't even gotten 1 yet? Who cares if it's not \"impressive\" enough to hypothetical people I've never seen? Implementation has its considerations, but shouldn't be to the point of blocking all progress. Certainly not to where working on the project isn't fulfilling anymore. So, sometimes, after a long paralysis, I yell at myself mentally to, quote, \"Just freakin' do it already, for the love of everything holy, just write the fudging thing- [insert more aggressive self-yelling]\" , overriding my thoughts to do without that pesky thinking. But yeah, those are my accounts with those challenges. Good luck wherever the future takes you! reply",

I pride myself on having the courage to tackle any problem. For example, most recently, I added a feature to an open source client for SQL Server. The work involved dealing with binary protocols, which I hadn't done before, see here: https://github.com/denisenkom/pytds/pull/182 I'm currently also pursuing a masters in applied math, where I'm learning topics such as Numerical Methods, Risk Theory, Game Theory, Stochastic Processes, Statistics and others.",

Email: ar9tech@outlook.com I am a systems software engineer specializing in low-level software design for backend systems. My professional experience spans multiple compiled languages, including Rust, C++, and Go. I have developed REST API servers, gRPC programs, and background job handlers/schedulers. In Rust, I have extensive hands-on experience building low-level applications using the Tokio runtime, applying strong principles of distributed systems, and working with synchronization primitives such as Mutexes, RwLocks, and concurrent data structures. I also focus on performance optimizations that leverage the language’s zero-cost abstractions and memory model. I place strong emphasis on building reliable test environments, using real-world testing methodologies such as unit tests, integration tests, concurrency stress tests, and fixture-based simulations. I have worked with clients across several domains, including:\n- Image processing\n- Blockchain network layer design\n- Cloud infrastructure solutions One of my most significant Rust projects was developing and deploying a web-based terminal access system for LXD containers running on bare-metal servers. This system leveraged Tokio for concurrency, TTYD for terminal emulation, and Caddy as the reverse proxy, with communication over Unix Domain Sockets. The solution also supported authentication. Efficient and scalable under configuration of environment. I love playing with distributed system a lot and challenging myself to learn new concepts under this domain. reply",

I've also worked over a year in a classified setting and I still hold a security clearance. I'm looking for a junior/entry level software engineer position.

In general I want to advance the frontier of what's possible. My credentials are more towards research engineering than applied work, but I'm open to both. My last job was as a contract research engineer doing AI safety work at Redwood Research. I spent about half my time on our synthetic datasets of safe & unsafe LLM behavior, and the other half on fancy finetuning. I finetuned an LLM to exhibit unsafe behavior while fooling logistic probes trained to detect it, but only in deployment. Weird multi-part composite loss. My other big project is independent research in text-to-image models that are trained solely on unlabeled image data, exploiting CLIP embeddings for the link between text and images.

I do well with detail-oriented work. I have 14.7k reputation on StackOverflow and have answered over 300 questions there, mostly on .NET-related topics. (The link to my SO profile is on my CV.) I'm looking for a senior full stack or senior backend role. I was unable to work following issues during the pandemic, which are now resolved, but I'm rarely getting to talk with anyone to be considered for interviews; AI rejects my CV outright. I'm stuck in an algorithmic prison. Despite the length of break, my knowledge is current. If you need convincing of that, I recently got through the whole interview process at Moneybox for a senior backend role, which is pretty much the only interview I've had. Although they hired someone else, they spent a week trying to allocate extra budget to hire me. Unfortunately, that didn't happen, and so here I am. If you aren't hiring, but know someone who is, I'd appreciate you sharing my details with them. I can start straight away. If anyone has any advice to help break out of the AI auto rejections, I'd also appreciate it if you'd contact me via email. Thanks for reading.",

I have strong history building dependable software in environments from startups to large corporations, and I value opportunities to work with new technologies and languages. Growing teams and mentoring junior engineers are also essential skills on my CV. I am detail-oriented (testing and code comments are crucial), and I value effective and kind communication. I bring a mindset focused on reliability even under ambiguous requirements, and I try to do the \"right thing\" even when it's difficult. Right now, as side projects I'm working on writing an emulator in Rust, and an app for some task planning. Feel free to send an email or LinkedIn message! I always welcome good conversation and interesting technical challenges.",
