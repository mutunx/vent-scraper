I can say, however, that hearing aids are not the only thing that helps - especially with meetings/noisy environments.

          "text": "> Specifically, the ones from [Captify][1]. Looks and seems great, always felt like a no-brainer use case for the smart glasses. But considering the kind of hardware they most likely are using, how is the captioning actually happening? I'm really scared of getting hardware that is 100% cloud dependent, as eventually the company gets bought or shut down, and then you end up having to repeat the process of figuring out what to buy next, and sometimes that just one or two years in the future. They are not making it clear how the captioning is happening, but since they don't claim it'll continue working even if the company disappears/shuts down, one can be safe to assume it's a cloud product, meaning it won't actually be a good fit for most people out there with a limited amount of money to spend on things like these. Edit: I realize now this product is not at all for people like me, \"Boost caption accuracy up to 98%\" and \"More accurate translations\" are locked behind a $15/month subscription, kind of disgusting how they hide making the product work as it should behind a subscription. I just want some simple glasses that can caption what people are saying without ripping me off, I guess we're too late into capitalism for that to actually be made for consumer. reply",

          "text": "Here's a crazy idea.  I personally prefer the fidelity of an active ambient in-ear monitor (IEM), as used by musicians on stage over the best hearing aids.  Once a year, I do a monthly trial with the latest hearing aid models and IMO the fidelity (especially low-end) and the comfort just is not there compared with the best active ambient IEMs.  The difference between hearing aids and IEMs is blurring, but they are not yet fully interchangeable. Standard IEMs isolate you from the world, which is the opposite of what a hearing aid does. However, a specific category called \"Active Ambient\" IEMs bridges this gap.  These are IEMs with embedded high-fidelity microphones on the outer shell. They pick up the sound of the room (bandmates, crowd, conductor), amplify it, and blend it with your monitor mix.  The accompanying bodypack or app often includes a multi-band EQ and Limiter. You can boost specific frequencies where you have hearing loss (e.g., boosting highs to hear cymbals or speech clearly) and set a volume ceiling to protect your remaining hearing.  I have no ownership/sponsorship in the product, but I personally LOVE the ASI Audio 3DME (powered by Sensaphonics), which is the industry standard for this. [1] It allows you to use an app to shape the ambient sound to your hearing needs. The Pros: It provides hearing protection + monitoring + hearing enhancement in one device. The Cons (Why they aren't daily hearing aids): 1) Form Factor: You are tethered to a belt pack. You likely won't wear a wired bodypack to a grocery store or dinner party. 2) Social Barrier: Wearing full-shell custom IEMs creates a \"do not disturb\" look that discourages conversation in social settings.  This can be more socially alienating than a comparatively inconspicuous hearing aid. 3) Battery Life: IEM systems typically last 6–8 hours, whereas hearing aid batteries can last days or weeks.

          "text": "Power requirements, moving mass and audio sampling and processing. Hearing aids run on tiny voltages (typically ~1.4 Volts). They are designed to amplify speech (a small frequency range) at moderate volumes.  An IEM is designed to handle the massive energy of a live drum kit without distortion. To do this, the internal amplifier needs Headroom. It likely steps up the battery voltage significantly (internally converting to higher voltage rails) to ensure that when a snare drum hits 120dB, the amplifier has enough electrical height to reproduce that spike without clipping. Hearing aids use microscopic balanced armature receivers that require almost zero power to move because they are only moving a tiny amount of air near your eardrum.  IEMs use dual-driver miniature subwoofers and tweeters that are physically larger and heavier. It takes significantly more electrical current to push these drivers back and forth. Hearing aids often use aggressive battery-saving tricks, such as lowering the sampling rate or \"sleeping\" processes when silence is detected.  The processor of an IEM is running wide open 100% of the time. It is constantly digitizing the world at a high sampling rate to ensure zero latency. If it tried to save battery by \"sleeping\" between notes, you would hear a delay (latency), which would make it impossible to play in time. reply",

          "text": "I have worn hearing aids since childhood in the '90s.  Moderate sloping to profound loss.  Been through all the tech since the equalized analog era. For a while now, like the last 15 to 20 years, since hearing aids went DSP, I had not been much impressed by each new generation.  At the risk of sounding like a bit of an advertisement, that changed this year. I have the new Oticon Intent.  RIC style aid.  They have some of the best spatial awareness I've experienced.    They're capable of quite a lot of directionality - accelerometer and three microphones in each.   I had to have the intensity of the directionality turned down a bit.  It was startling me when I turned my head and I wasn't hearing things behind me enough.  But that's at the expense of less signal due to more environmental noise. The machine-learning based noise reduction is an improvement over the previous generations, too. They have a music mode.  It drops all the speech remapping and noise reduction and just makes it feel loud.  It's some sort of perceptual algorithm: in my case as I turn up the volume it gets more and more treble, because only at the loudest volumes would I hear those high frequencies.  All while being power limited at 95 dB SPL so I know I'm not blowing my ears.  I used to wear over-the-ear headphones for that but I now prefer the hearing aids.

          "text": "I'll tell you what is NOT hot! I have Phonak Audeos paired over bluetooth with my iPhone.  A few years prior, I used to have Oticon, also paired with my iPhone. With the Oticon, if I made a cellphone call, the iPhone would use the default iPhone microphone while the audio would stream to my hearing aids.  It was good that way because in a noisy environment I could hold the iphone right up to my mouth and the other party would be able to hear what I was saying. With the newer Phonaks, I was very disappointed to find that the new hearing aids would only use the microphone input that is built into the hearing aids themselves, and not the iPhone mic input.  I discovered this when I realised that talking directly into iPhone mic did not make it any easier for the other party to hear me. I complained to my Audiologist who explained that yes, the new hearing aids were copying the behaviour of Apple AirPods, which also have the mic input on the earpod itself, and that there was no way at all to configure the Phonaks to use the iPhone mic input instead. Why is this a problem you might ask?  Because my hearing aids are Behind The Ear (BTE) and thus the mic input on the hearing aid is a good 4 inches away from my face and thus my voice cannot possibly sound as clear as when I could speak directly into an iPhone mic. When I next replace my hearing aids, I shall look for aids that do not mimic this crappy AirPods behaviour... reply",

Even the next generation Philips  9050 that supported Auracast didnt support this. We ended up with Phonaks rebranded as Sennheisers. The audio quality during calls may not be as clear as a separate mic (what i believe you refer to as oticon), but from a user experience its nice to not have to fish out your phone to answer a call or wonder why you can hear the other person but they cant hear you.

It’s a brain thing, my hearing itself is above average for my age (40), so I’m not sure what exactly can be done, but there was an article many years ago about someone (Bose?) working on aids for that issue, no idea what came of it. I guess all modern hearing aids have some focus mode.

You use half a dozen microphone transducers (minimum; Crappy microphone transducers are cheap and quality is expensive, so just use a bunch of them), and through a combination of phase and intensity they decode relative location, and amplify that phase expectation while suppressing everything that isn't phased like that. Sound is slow, and readily susceptible to real-time triangulation. The math/processing is much easier if the parallaxes are fixed (eg the microphones are arranged in a line array on the top band of a rigid pair of smart glasses), but with a little latency it's not prohibitive for a deformable array to solve for its own relative position as well. reply",

I rarely have to fiddle with the volume control and in fact do not even use any other settings than the main program - I find that whatever the core program is doing tends to be basically what I want. I also very much appreciate that they can natively connect to iPhones (this is also essentially the main reason I have an iPhone). This makes phone calls and music and podcasts very easy. (Whereas up until 2017, I used to dread phone calls.) I actually tried Phonaks briefly in 2022 and hated them. Lots of controls to fiddle with (some with oddly unintuitive names), but that meant I was constantly trying to adjust it and was rarely able to just exist in the moment. I found them markedly worse in noisy environments - I basically couldn’t have a conversation in a restaurant. reply",

          "text": "I have the Widex SmartRIC 220, and would buy them again. They are comfortable, have musical audio quality (Widex works with musicians), very low latency (reducing comb filter effect), and in general look and feel very professional. As for technology, they use bluetooth low energy to connect to the smart phone, which works really well, with the caveat that the range is quite low and if it is in the pocket and you are moving around, media sound will often disrupt or desync intermittently. On the plus side, they last well over a day even with media use (WIdex says they last 37 hours without bluetooth use and that checks out). The case provides charge for about a week, and has wireless and usb-c charging. They are quite pricey, but there are several options (110, 220, 330, 440), and the 220 were more than enough for me. The app has several modes, including directional focus mode, and you can define your own. I sometimes use a different mode for listening to concert music, that disables most filters such as volume protection. I am wearing them for 9 months now, and there was no situation (concerts, traveling, work, sports, etc) were they gave me any issues whatsoever. reply",

I ended up returning them and the only MfI hearing aids the audiologist I went to (I was limited by what was in-network by my insurance and while the old insurance covered equally in-network and out, my new insurance covered 0% out of network so I was going to be looking at double the price to go to Costco). I ended up with Resound which are essentially the same as the Jabras. The one thing that I find absolutely essential is using ear molds instead of domes. My cousin hated ear molds and gave up on them, but I definitely prefer them. Incidentally, I would recommend the HA/hearing loss subreddits (r/HearingAids and r/hardofhearing) over HN for this discussion. The HA group can get a little rigid, but I really like the community at HoH. reply",

In terms of hearing quality, for me, it's been solid, with the caveat that it took a while to get the fitting right. I think my audiologist was a bit old school, and was sticking to settings he'd known to be good in the past rather than fitting for what the aid is capable of. I've recently had its prescription type updated to the native Oticon one, and it's been a revelation in terms of clarity. My hearing loss is relatively recent (About four years now) so I will caveat this that I've only used Oticons, so can't really compare to anything else. reply",

          "text": "I'll tell you what's not hot: cochlear implants. I wore hearing aids since the late '80s. I wear CIs as of about 5 years ago, and while my hearing is much better and stable than it used to be, I've found that UX for CIs is pretty bad. For one, unless you use Med-El's Rondo processeor, you're going to have a thin cable connecting your processor to the coil. Taking off your CIs and putting them back on (as one does every day) is going to put stress on the cable. Sometimes the cable frays and you find that out with sound cutting in and out. There's nothing you can do until the manufacturer sends you a replacement cable in exchange for your frayed one. If you want a backup, be ready to shell out $250 for each cable. Another UX issue is that processors depend on gravity to stay on your ears. Since there's no earmold to anchor to, processors can easily be jostled off and left hanging precariously. Wearing hearing aids, I never had to worry that my hearing devices would fall off if I rode my bike on a bumpy road. Also with cochlear implants, high-intensity interval training requires some kind of hat or bandana to make sure that the processors don't fly out. Battery life is another disappointment. Rechargeable batteries don't last a full day. If I put them in at 6:30a, they'll last until about 4:30p. With disposable zinc air batteries, I can squeeze out about a day and a half, but then I'm having to dispose batteries. And while I can track processor battery levels with the rechargeable batteries on my phone, disposable batteries are opaque to the app. One new thing that would be useful in terms of UX would be an configurable indicator, e.g., a blinking LED, signaling that audio streaming is occurring. It's awkward to find oneself in a conversation that already started and having to excuse oneself to turn off the stream. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad I have my cochlear implants, but they're way behind hearing aids in terms of UX. reply",

The files are properly corrupted - can't view them on other devices either. I checked some out in a hex editor and sure enough there is a good chunk of null bytes in the beginning. Sometimes it's just the first byte and changing it from 00 to FF fixes the image. But oftentimes it's a whole lot more 00s to the point where I don't know how to recover the image.<p>I've been using only Pixel a-series phones for the last couple years (3a, 6a, 9a) and had this happen on all of them. It surely can't be bad storage, can it? I feel like there is a bug in some part of Google's Android OS.<p>Has anyone of you encountered this issue? I can't believe I'm alone with it.</p></p></div>",

I swear everyone at that company doesn't even use their own products because for every one thing they fix, two new things break. Functionality of some things don't make sense. There is zero reason to have Media Encoder be its own separate program when it can be integrated into Premiere and AE on its own, which can repeatedly cause connection/bug issues if they're not able to sync properly (also not being up to date on newer file container types which it should offer). Which also leads into the problem of separating everything into more and more different programs to milk every cent. On top of the massive cancellation fees they try to stick to people and KEEP trying to force cloud saving onto everyone so you become reliant on keeping your sub to keep access to files. It's unfortunately become industry standard and while there are other/free options they're not as up to par on capabilities just yet for top tier level for an entire creative suite of work. Currently it's around $700/yr per user. Shutterstock is $1500/yr per seat for level I use, with frustrating UX in search function and now you have to pay for a subscription, and then pay even MORE if you want to use anything they deem to be \"highly desirable\" like Amazon. Oh you have a subscription? Well to get access to what you see here you have to subscribe even more. They added AI content which is chock full of AI slop and copyright issues which clearly isn't being moderated. They also have a ton of vector files which werent checked at all because they're just JPGs saved in vector containers, making them pretty much unusable.

My parents were also lucky enough to be employed with a mortgage. The one thing killing me in the economy is housing. Rent is up like crazy, but even more so rental criteria is ridiculous and competition is insane. And this is in a dilapidated rust belt city with maybe one industry propping up the entire economy. It’s a bit cheaper than when I was in Florida a few years back, but not by a ton. If I could figure out housing, all other problems would solve themselves, but it’s the one problem I can’t solve. My credit score took a battering during a long period of unemployment, and now I’m about as much of a pariah as a three time felon with two evictions, and I don’t even have an eviction. But how was in after the 2008 crisis. How hard was it to find rent them. If you had a job, and income were the rents still ridiculous? Or was it easy enough to find a place if you had money? reply",

So people who are good at managing money, who tend to avoid credit, don't get a chance to demonstrate good -credit- management and hence end up with a low score. This is one reason why getting a credit card, using it, and then paying it off in full every month is a valuable thing to do. So for all the good money managers out there, be even smarter - build a good credit management history as a side effect of your good money management. That'll pay off in the long run. reply",

I read somewhere that when women started working in the war efforts, businesses took advantage and skewed home prices and whatnot to make it so women had no choice but to continue working. This worked out well, because women wanted to work and have similar social treatment as men. The issue then is that things kept skewing to the point where today a childless couple with high paying jobs can barely afford a vehicle and tiny apartment. This may or may not be accurate.

          "text": "“ the husband was the sole bread winner, kept his job for most of his life, and could afford the house, car, 4 children and a few pets.” We don’t _forget_ this.  We refute it.  It’s not true.  It’s a dream that real estate developers _sold_ that wasn’t real. In 1975 the women’s labor participation rate stood right around 50% its around 55% now [0]. In 1975 the US home ownership rate was 65%, its 65% now [1]. There were more families with no cars in the 70s than now. 1 and 2 car families were about the same rate (with more 2 car families now) but the big difference is how many more families have more than 2 cars now than then [2]. More stats for you:\n- food as a percentage of family budget is lower now than then (and the only reason its close is that we eat out way more now)[3]\n- houses are bigger now than then[4]\n- data on employee tenure doesn’t go back that far, but the data we do have to the 80s shows employee tenure hasn’t changed [5] There are lots of interesting economic challenges now, but _generally_ more people now are living better lives than then past economically.  Anyone that sells you some story about some glorious past is lying to you for some reason. Home ownership rates are always the tell.  The US had very stable home ownership rates in the 45% range until the New Deal efforts that started subsidizing like crazy home ownership. They rose in the post war era until about 1960 when they reached the mid 60s.  They have fluctuated in a tight curve in that band since then.  The home ownership rate is tightly correlated to mortgage rates, not generational values, and spikes in 2005 (right before the bubble burst) not in the dim past [6].

PhD is something I really wanted to do because it allows me to dive deep into stuff. Turns out what I thought initially was not the whole story.<p>I am nearing the end of second year of my PhD. My advisor is in HPC but doesn't do hot research and I want to do efficient hardware AI research (faster kernels, ML systems etc). But whenever I read papers and see the authors and what they have accomplished and the team behind them and the prestigious schools/labs doing them while I am deep in some cuBLAS function hoping to optimize register tiling to be a nanosecond faster, I feel like a failure. I don't know what problems to work on. I wonder if what I want to do even requires a PhD.<p>I question if I will ever be able to do anything publishable as the labs in MIT/Stanford, their cohort of brilliant minds basically alone? There's so much out there that I don't know. The more I think I know the more stuffs keep popping up. I thought I had finally understood LLMs to their nitty gritty details but then there's even more new variants of attentions popping up. I am not sure if I will be able to read everything needed to be able to research. I want to be able to get a job in the US after my PhD(home is terrifying) and I am an international  so quiting is not an option.<p>I am looking for any advice or if you were in a similar boat anything would be helpful. Thank you.</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "That is the second year of a PhD - the first year you're distracted by your literature survey of the area you're interested in. The second year is where you're trying to dig out a little niche that you can work in and expand the knowledge of what's there. The third year is where you're supposed to be writing up, but in reality you're probably still working on building up enough new knowledge in the area to actually write up. It's not uncommon to feel the way you are during the second and third years - my advice is to recognise how you're feeling and then work out how to push forward (which is what you've already started to do). My advice for how you can compete with large research projects full of postdocs is, don't try to.  You're not in competition with them, you are doing your own research.  It might be in a tiny niche area, but it's your area and it's new knowledge. reply",

Those jobs have been everything from startups, to boring stable small and medium  “lifestyle companies”, to boring big enterprise, to $BigTech and now I work in customer facing cloud consulting as a staff consultant. And I’ve never seen a market this shitty.  Even after the dot com bust if you were a regular old enterprise dev - and at the time I had 4 years of experience as a Windows developer in Atlanta - it was easy to find a job. 2009-2011 was a shit show but it wasn’t that bad. While I did find a job quickly after being Amazon’ed in 2023 and again last year, things have gutted worse since then. My only strategy is to keep our fixed living expenses way down (less than half my income and I’m the only one working by choice), stay out of debt, keep a years saving in the bank, keep my resume updated and a longer form career document [1], keep my skillset in line with the market (I lead   a lot of “AI” related non chatbot projects) and keep a strong network. I feel a tinge of FOMO knowing that an intern I mentored while they were an intern an a year after coming back makes a little more than I make.  They are 25 and a mid level  SA at AWS - similar to what I do. I have to think about the story of the “Mexican Fisherman”. https://bemorewithless.com/the-story-of-the-mexican-fisherma...

Turns out the guy was really off taking an afternoon nap. Luckily we could solve things without his help, but to us in Europe that was really weird. Later we did some research and discovered that people in that part of the world really like to take afternoon naps, even though they should be at work... reply",

But most people wouldn't be able to speak these languages, so we mostly used English. The customer was often Indonesian and would write bug reports in the language. The non-Indo speakers would just run them through Google translate and comment what they understood and those who were native speakers would correct them if they were mistaken. Especially when there's sarcasm or some cultural context. There were a few who only spoke the Chinese dialects, and we'd use an intermediary in meetings, and AI/Google translate on text and code. This was also a good use of AI - it was fluent in whatever language, Java or Mandarin and could piece them together well. Anyway, yeah, it's workable. Nobody knows all the languages. In engineering, there's more empathy for this, especially from the multilinguals. reply",

Don't rush it 2- Its fine to formulate what you want to say in your mind before saying it. take your time. 3- Use a phone and record yourself speaking about different subject. Practice, practice and practice. 4- Some audiences are harder than others. French people for example tend to nitpick and want you to be really fluent. While most english speakers are fine with your speaking, but it depends on the audience and who you are speaking to. 5- You obviously need to immerse yourself in the language you want to speak. Tv-shows, Movies, News and even tabloid. The latter is actuallt good to understand jokes, innuendos and other subtle conversations. One thing I also noted, is that if you follow/watch people who are not native speakers, they actually tend to explain things/concepts better. Because they are limited in words and have limited scope compared to native speaker. Anyone remarked this? reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">We're a small business where we invest everything back into R&amp;D, so we're not sitting on huge cash reserves. We have a case just filed against us that is visible online but we're waiting to be served, for patent infringement. The company claiming infringement is known to us, they have been trying to get a foothold in our market for years, but their product hasn't found solid ground. We welcome competition as it drives a healthy economy, and we've got a really positive social standing in the community for supporting our customers and we're pretty highly respected by everyone. So when we found they had filed this complaint we were shocked. The complaint has no basis in reality as our product demonstrably does not implement any method of what their patent says, it will definitely be thrown out if it goes to court. But that's a stupid waste of time and money for us both. Has anyone had any success in writing to the company directly and showing how their case will lose, so they drop it and stop spending on something that will fail? We believe they filed out of bad faith because of jealousy and frustration against us. We've taken care never to speak against them or anyone in public, we know this is just sour grapes on their part. Obviously we're going to wait until we've been served but I feel that we can avoid further costs by sending a personal de letter to the owner of this company - I feel that they also have limited funds.</div>",

          "text": "I encourage you to get clear on your goals for a project like this. There is a political and social dimension to this work aside from the technical challenge. For example, ordinary people already know whether they're being squeezed or not. They don't need a CPI report. If you want them to believe your CPI report over the government's, then you have to do a lot of marketing. On the opposite side, government decision makers are generally moving away from a \"technocrat\" data-driven approach to decisions, towards a \"great man\" theory of decision making: giving them better CPI data won't suddenly make them care about using data again. A lot of people are putin in work to dismantle American government capacity, and there are worse problem than inflation tracking. My personal opinion is that it doesn't make sense to create a community-driven CPI as a direct alternative to the government CPI. But it does make sense to collect a lot of this data for other uses (ex: to highlight illegal collusion among merchants, archival). From a technical perspective, here are some thoughts from a Canadian lens:\n* CPI calculations are already fairly transparent. You can read about the work that goes into them (click TOC on upper right: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/62-553-x/62-553-x2023001... )\n* Government-collected raw data is not open to the public, because merchants wouldn't have give the govt' access to their POS data if it were otherwise. The Canadian government made a tradeoff: it gets very accurate data, in exchange for it being hidden from the public.\n* As WheelsAtLarge mentioned, data collection and analysis takes effort and money. Especially when you're doing it for the long term. You'll have to think of funding and keeping people motivated to do the work.\n* Scraping data might be a lot harder than you expect. I compile the largest open dataset of grocery prices in Canada, and have 20 months' worth of data. Its very difficult to average prices across merchants (because many don't reveal product UPC codes). And prices vary by geography. None of this is insurmountable, but it takes effort and money. Go ahead and play with the data to get a feel for how easy/difficult this is ( https://jacobfilipp.com/hammer/ ) reply",

They do a pretty good job and they try to be as accurate as possible. I can't see any another organization gathering the data without needing to be greatly compensated. As far as trust, there have always been people that have and will criticize the results but they only have a small view of the prices which doesn't give a true view of inflation. So their criticism is invalid. The problem with a decentralized version is that people will need to be compensated. People might get together to do it a few times but for it to be useful it needs to get done for as long as there's an American economy.  It won't happen without some kind of compensation. reply",

          "text": "It might have a minor beneficial impact to tourism in Saint Barthelemy and Norfolk Island from geeks wanting a trendy new account registered in a territory with fewer than 1000 IPv4 addresses allocated.[1] A more useful addition would be a contributions calendar similar to GitHub's [2] but focused on which time zones the user is active within, and importantly, the latency of the user's replies. It's trivial to fake geographic location observed through source IP addresses (or even RTT multilateration) but much harder to fake time zones a user is active within, particularly if monitoring latency of replies. edit: To further clarify, I don't think a contributions calendar would be beneficial to HN either. I've never cared to think about the country a commenter resides in, and don't care about username/real name either unless the commenter is appealing to their own authority (e.g. \"I am the author of this software\"). Even then, the usefulness of an appeal to own authority is often limited to the ability to reverse lookup the user's personal website (which itself is proven to be notable from other sources) for a link back to their HN profile.

          "text": "I have worn hearing aids since childhood in the '90s.  Moderate sloping to profound loss.  Been through all the tech since the equalized analog era. For a while now, like the last 15 to 20 years, since hearing aids went DSP, I had not been much impressed by each new generation.  At the risk of sounding like a bit of an advertisement, that changed this year. I have the new Oticon Intent.  RIC style aid.  They have some of the best spatial awareness I've experienced.    They're capable of quite a lot of directionality - accelerometer and three microphones in each.   I had to have the intensity of the directionality turned down a bit.  It was startling me when I turned my head and I wasn't hearing things behind me enough.  But that's at the expense of less signal due to more environmental noise. The machine-learning based noise reduction is an improvement over the previous generations, too. They have a music mode.  It drops all the speech remapping and noise reduction and just makes it feel loud.  It's some sort of perceptual algorithm: in my case as I turn up the volume it gets more and more treble, because only at the loudest volumes would I hear those high frequencies.  All while being power limited at 95 dB SPL so I know I'm not blowing my ears.  I used to wear over-the-ear headphones for that but I now prefer the hearing aids.   It's nice to not worry about if it's too loud. reply",

          "text": "Just as a tip, shouting or even just speaking more loudly is rarely necessary if someone has (properly configured) hearing aids.  Just speak clearly.  Ensuring proper enunciation so they can read lips is usually more important.  Hearing aids will make it \"loud enough\" but they won't clean up the information. Does she have primarily high frequency loss?  High frequency loss is the most typical in the elderly and also from damage from noise exposure. Different people have different voices.  I usually find it easier to understand men because I hear the lower frequencies better, especially without my hearing aids but also with them.   And it's always easier to understand people you know well compared to strangers. I find small speakers to be awful.  The high frequencies are distorted and tinny.  Scratchy is a good way to put it.  I have a very hard time understanding anything played through a smartphone or tablet speaker.  The speaker is too small to reproduce the bass frequencies I can hear the best, and so it's just TSSST TSSSSSZZT sounds through my hearing aids. I cannot wear my hearing aids at full volume at the dinner table or while working in the kitchen for this reason.  Metal, plastic and paper are also common offenders.   CLINK.  CLINK.  CRSZZST.  It's almost painful and headache inducing if I'm tired. Unfortunately those high frequencies are what carry speech sounds like sh, t, ch and so on.  Without those it's like the adults talking in the Charlie Brown cartoons.  \"wah-womp-wah-wah-mhuh??\" Hearing aids can do two things for this: one is to take some of that high frequency information and remap it to lower frequencies.  This is part of why they say you won't like wearing your hearing aids when you first get them.  They're systematically distorting what you hear -- but in a way you might eventually learn to interpret. The other is just to make it loud enough that it can be heard.  And as you suggest that may be the limit of the hearing capacity if there's very little at the high frequencies the only way to make something high frequency to be perceived, is to hammer the ear with a 90 or 100 dB level of sound. It's absolutely worth having them adjusted a bit.  Also every manufacturer uses a different algorithm for speech frequency remapping.  Some people have strong preferences by brand as to the hearing aid sound.  (Phonak and Oticon certainly have different \"feels\" in my experience.) Almost all hearing aids allow multiple \"configuration profiles\" where you can switch through them with the app or buttons.  I have four: general, lecture, comfort, music.  Comfort mode just nukes the high end and cranks up the noise reduction.  That's what I use if I'm just reading alone in the living room, or when out at the grocery store, etc. As to large groups, personally I've simply conceded I can't do large groups.  If I try I will feel left out and get depressed over it.  If people want to see me at a family reunion, for example, after I do a brief tour to say hi to everyone, they'll have to join me for a small group chat in the den or whatnot. reply",

          "text": "Here's a crazy idea.  I personally prefer the fidelity of an active ambient in-ear monitor (IEM), as used by musicians on stage over the best hearing aids.  Once a year, I do a monthly trial with the latest hearing aid models and IMO the fidelity (especially low-end) and the comfort just is not there compared with the best active ambient IEMs.  The difference between hearing aids and IEMs is blurring, but they are not yet fully interchangeable. Standard IEMs isolate you from the world, which is the opposite of what a hearing aid does. However, a specific category called \"Active Ambient\" IEMs bridges this gap.  These are IEMs with embedded high-fidelity microphones on the outer shell. They pick up the sound of the room (bandmates, crowd, conductor), amplify it, and blend it with your monitor mix.  The accompanying bodypack or app often includes a multi-band EQ and Limiter. You can boost specific frequencies where you have hearing loss (e.g., boosting highs to hear cymbals or speech clearly) and set a volume ceiling to protect your remaining hearing.  I have no ownership/sponsorship in the product, but I personally LOVE the ASI Audio 3DME (powered by Sensaphonics), which is the industry standard for this. [1] It allows you to use an app to shape the ambient sound to your hearing needs. The Pros: It provides hearing protection + monitoring + hearing enhancement in one device. The Cons (Why they aren't daily hearing aids): 1) Form Factor: You are tethered to a belt pack. You likely won't wear a wired bodypack to a grocery store or dinner party. 2) Social Barrier: Wearing full-shell custom IEMs creates a \"do not disturb\" look that discourages conversation in social settings.  This can be more socially alienating than a comparatively inconspicuous hearing aid. 3) Battery Life: IEM systems typically last 6–8 hours, whereas hearing aid batteries can last days or weeks.

          "text": "Power requirements, moving mass and audio sampling and processing. Hearing aids run on tiny voltages (typically ~1.4 Volts). They are designed to amplify speech (a small frequency range) at moderate volumes.  An IEM is designed to handle the massive energy of a live drum kit without distortion. To do this, the internal amplifier needs Headroom. It likely steps up the battery voltage significantly (internally converting to higher voltage rails) to ensure that when a snare drum hits 120dB, the amplifier has enough electrical height to reproduce that spike without clipping. Hearing aids use microscopic balanced armature receivers that require almost zero power to move because they are only moving a tiny amount of air near your eardrum.  IEMs use dual-driver miniature subwoofers and tweeters that are physically larger and heavier. It takes significantly more electrical current to push these drivers back and forth. Hearing aids often use aggressive battery-saving tricks, such as lowering the sampling rate or \"sleeping\" processes when silence is detected.  The processor of an IEM is running wide open 100% of the time. It is constantly digitizing the world at a high sampling rate to ensure zero latency. If it tried to save battery by \"sleeping\" between notes, you would hear a delay (latency), which would make it impossible to play in time. reply",

          "text": "Let’s try some actual numbers. A fancy passive IEM quotes: > Sensitivity: 114 dB-SPL (@ 0.1V) That’s on the high side for an IEM.  Let’s be conservative and say it’s actually 100dB SPL at 1mW (which is on the low side) and that the user has hearing loss and the IEM is actually outputting 90dB continuously (I’m not an expert but this seems high. Certainly I would not set an active IEM anywhere near that loud, even at a concert).  That’s 0.1mW of electrical power to each IEM, for 0.2mW total.  This part could run for days on a small battery pack. A modern amplifier might as well be 100% efficient, although that body pack could easily be some wildly efficient Class A design. Let’s suppose the DSP is processing 96kSPS (might as well minimize latency and the need for a complex antialiasing setup and let’s assume it’s using a duper-high-fidelity FIR filter that’s a whole 100ms long, i.e. 9600 taps, and that the FIR implementation is pure brute force, so there are 9600 times 96k FMAs per second.  That’s about 2 billion FMAs per second for both ears.  (Again, this is a ridiculous way to do this.)  The fancy nonlinear compression stuff will be negligible in comparison. From some quick Googling, you could easily spend a whole watt on the DSP. And there’s where all that battery charge goes :) I bet that someone who really cared about optimizing this could put some software engineering into getting DSP power down below 50mW.  Either use an FFT to optimize the filter or use a much lower complexity filter bank. reply",

          "text": "Thanks! I have hearing aids too and, while I don't have profound hearing loss (severe one side, moderate the other), it's got to the point where I am starting to look at other solutions to supplement them. For those not aware: hearing aids are not like eyeglasses, where you can effectively have your vision restored to 20/20 with the right prescription. They help, but they don't get you up to the level of a person with ordinary hearing. This goes particularly for situations with high background noise, multiple voices, etc.: restaurants, bars, parties and other places where social life tends to happen. Your recommendation has made me think I should finally take the leap on live-caption glasses, which I've been watching for a while now. It sounds like they've finally got to the point where they're effective. A question: how do you find them in conversations with multiple people? Do the glasses help you distinguish speakers by breaking out text from different voices, or is it all just a stream of words? What if there are multiple conversations going on - do the glasses manage to \"focus\" captioning on the one you're closest to, or do other conversations creep in? The captions on google meet have been useful for me as well, although I do wish they were more configurable, e.g. being able to give the captioning model a list of technical phrases, internal company terms, or acronyms that are likely to come up. There also seems to be a gap still between real time transcription, which is good, and after-the-fact transcription, which is excellent. (You can also use an LLM for the latter and prompt it yourself with extra context, although that may not be the best model.) It's been great to see so much progress in this area in the past few years. I am hoping the current (over-)investment in AI at least has the side effect of improving the tech still further. reply",

What if there are multiple conversations going on - do the glasses manage to \"focus\" captioning on the one you're closest to, or do other conversations creep in? It really depends if people are talking at the same time or not. If in a close group (space matters, the mic only goes ~2-3m), one person talking at a time, then they're great. That's the setup I most often have at conferences, so it's been great there. In evenings/parties, it's a bit more chaotic, and the glasses tend to fall off for sure. Regarding distinguishing different speakers etc I haven't needed that, I use the glasses as a helper, they fill in the gaps. So it's \"just a stream of words\", but it has been enough to already help a ton. The directional mic does work quite well, but sometimes you have just 2 conversations happening in front of you and it's not working at all. In other setups (especially professional ones), people usually speak one at a time and it works great. reply",

I'm really scared of getting hardware that is 100% cloud dependent, as eventually the company gets bought or shut down, and then you end up having to repeat the process of figuring out what to buy next, and sometimes that just one or two years in the future. They are not making it clear how the captioning is happening, but since they don't claim it'll continue working even if the company disappears/shuts down, one can be safe to assume it's a cloud product, meaning it won't actually be a good fit for most people out there with a limited amount of money to spend on things like these.

          "text": "I'll tell you what is NOT hot! I have Phonak Audeos paired over bluetooth with my iPhone.  A few years prior, I used to have Oticon, also paired with my iPhone. With the Oticon, if I made a cellphone call, the iPhone would use the default iPhone microphone while the audio would stream to my hearing aids.  It was good that way because in a noisy environment I could hold the iphone right up to my mouth and the other party would be able to hear what I was saying. With the newer Phonaks, I was very disappointed to find that the new hearing aids would only use the microphone input that is built into the hearing aids themselves, and not the iPhone mic input.  I discovered this when I realised that talking directly into iPhone mic did not make it any easier for the other party to hear me. I complained to my Audiologist who explained that yes, the new hearing aids were copying the behaviour of Apple AirPods, which also have the mic input on the earpod itself, and that there was no way at all to configure the Phonaks to use the iPhone mic input instead. Why is this a problem you might ask?  Because my hearing aids are Behind The Ear (BTE) and thus the mic input on the hearing aid is a good 4 inches away from my face and thus my voice cannot possibly sound as clear as when I could speak directly into an iPhone mic. When I next replace my hearing aids, I shall look for aids that do not mimic this crappy AirPods behaviour... reply",

Even the next generation Philips  9050 that supported Auracast didnt support this. We ended up with Phonaks rebranded as Sennheisers. The audio quality during calls may not be as clear as a separate mic (what i believe you refer to as oticon), but from a user experience its nice to not have to fish out your phone to answer a call or wonder why you can hear the other person but they cant hear you.

Sound is slow, and readily susceptible to real-time triangulation.

          "text": "I have moderate-to-profound hearing loss and have worn hearing aids since I was 4. I currently have Oticon Opn1’s and have had Oticons since 2017 (and got new ones in 2022) and they are fabulous. I find the sound quality in noisy environments much better than any other aid I’ve had - much better perception of voices in restaurants, for example. I rarely have to fiddle with the volume control and in fact do not even use any other settings than the main program - I find that whatever the core program is doing tends to be basically what I want. I also very much appreciate that they can natively connect to iPhones (this is also essentially the main reason I have an iPhone). This makes phone calls and music and podcasts very easy. (Whereas up until 2017, I used to dread phone calls.) I actually tried Phonaks briefly in 2022 and hated them. Lots of controls to fiddle with (some with oddly unintuitive names), but that meant I was constantly trying to adjust it and was rarely able to just exist in the moment. I found them markedly worse in noisy environments - I basically couldn’t have a conversation in a restaurant. reply",

          "text": "Audiologist and hearing aid user here. It's a great time to be looking for new hearing aids! Speech in noise capabilities have improved massively this generation, and I can personally attest to this. For me, the most important performance metric is speech perception in noisy / challenging listening situations. For you there might be other considerations, so keep that in mind. With that said, my recommendation are the new Phonak Infinio Sphere devices with with their \"Spheric speech in noise\" feature. It's a complete game changer in terms of speech perception in loud noise. Activating this program in a noisy situation feels like turning off the background noise, leaving only (nearby) voices. The caveat is that to achieve this they use a separate, power-hungry processor and compensate by increasing the battery size (making the whole hearing aid bigger than other, similar hearing aids). The upside to this is that if you're _not_ using the spherical program, you'll have really good battery life. I use mine for exactly 16 hours a day and if I'm careful I can make them last almost three full days. The charger is much better than the previous ones; they use magnets to keep the devices in place instead of relying on plastic friction. The Oticon Intent and new Starkey AI aids are also great. You should always try more than one model before you make a decision. Happy to answer any questions! reply",

          "text": "I have the Widex SmartRIC 220, and would buy them again. They are comfortable, have musical audio quality (Widex works with musicians), very low latency (reducing comb filter effect), and in general look and feel very professional. As for technology, they use bluetooth low energy to connect to the smart phone, which works really well, with the caveat that the range is quite low and if it is in the pocket and you are moving around, media sound will often disrupt or desync intermittently. On the plus side, they last well over a day even with media use (WIdex says they last 37 hours without bluetooth use and that checks out). The case provides charge for about a week, and has wireless and usb-c charging. They are quite pricey, but there are several options (110, 220, 330, 440), and the 220 were more than enough for me. The app has several modes, including directional focus mode, and you can define your own. I sometimes use a different mode for listening to concert music, that disables most filters such as volume protection. I am wearing them for 9 months now, and there was no situation (concerts, traveling, work, sports, etc) were they gave me any issues whatsoever. reply",

I tried Phonaks and found that the use of Bluetooth to connect to my iPhone was painfully flakey (there were certain locations in my neighborhood that every time I walked in front of a particular house, I would lose audio). I ended up returning them and the only MfI hearing aids the audiologist I went to (I was limited by what was in-network by my insurance and while the old insurance covered equally in-network and out, my new insurance covered 0% out of network so I was going to be looking at double the price to go to Costco). I ended up with Resound which are essentially the same as the Jabras. The one thing that I find absolutely essential is using ear molds instead of domes. My cousin hated ear molds and gave up on them, but I definitely prefer them. Incidentally, I would recommend the HA/hearing loss subreddits (r/HearingAids and r/hardofhearing) over HN for this discussion. The HA group can get a little rigid, but I really like the community at HoH. reply",

I have tried a few aids before (Starkey and some older Phonak) and I do really like the Oticon 'sound'. They work for me, but of course YMMV. I think many aid manufacturers (many of them the same company - WDH!) do 60 day trials. Worth a shot. My only dislike is the new fad, particularly of Oticon, of stopping disposable batteries and only going rechargeable.\nDisposable zinc-air cells have great life (I'd get a week on the Opns at least, with a few hours streaming per day). I travel for work a lot, so carrying a couple of tiny 312's in my wallet or keychain was perfect.\nThe Zeal look to have what Oticon think is a 'compact' charger - but it ain't small.\nMy kingdom for a charger the size of the AirPods Pro case... reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">We’re hitting a classic distributed systems wall and I’m looking for war stories or \"least worst\" practices.<p>The Context: We maintain a distributed stateful engine (think search/analytics). The architecture is standard: a Control Plane (Coordinator) assigns data segments to Worker Nodes. The workload involves heavy use of mmap and lazy loading for large datasets.<p>The Incident: We had a cascading failure where the Coordinator got stuck in a loop, DDOS-ing a specific node.<p>The Signal: Coordinator sees Node A has significantly fewer rows (logical count) than the cluster average. It flags Node A as \"underutilized.\"<p>The Action: Coordinator attempts to rebalance/load new segments onto Node A.<p>The Reality: Node A is actually sitting at 197GB RAM usage (near OOM). The data on it happens to be extremely wide (fat rows, huge blobs), so its logical row count is low, but physical footprint is massive.<p>The Loop: Node A rejects the load (or times out). The Coordinator ignores the backpressure, sees the low row count again, and retries immediately.<p>The Core Problem: We are trying to write a \"God Equation\" for our load balancer. We started with row_count, which failed. We looked at disk usage, but that doesn't correlate with RAM because of lazy loading.<p>Now we are staring at mmap. Because the OS manages the page cache, the application-level RSS is noisy and doesn't strictly reflect \"required\" memory vs \"reclaimable\" cache.<p>The Question: Attempting to enumerate every resource variable (CPU, IOPS, RSS, Disk, logical count) into a single scoring function feels like an NP-hard trap.<p>How do you handle placement in systems where memory usage is opaque/dynamic?<p>Dumb Coordinator, Smart Nodes: Should we just let the Coordinator blind-fire based on disk space, and rely 100% on the Node to return hard 429 Too Many Requests based on local pressure?<p>Cost Estimation: Do we try to build a synthetic \"cost model\" per segment (e.g., predicted memory footprint) and schedule based on credits, ignoring actual OS metrics?<p>Control Plane Decoupling: Separate storage balancing (disk) from query balancing (mem)?<p>Feels like we are reinventing the wheel. References to papers or similar architecture post-mortems appreciated.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "There's a simple solution: don't use mmap().  There's a reason that databases use O_DIRECT to read into their own in memory cache.  If it was Good Enough for Oracle in the 1990s, it's probably Good Enough for you. mmap() is one of those things that looks like it's an easy solution when you start writing an application, but that's only because you don't know the complexity time bomb of what you're undertaking. The entire point of the various ways of performing asynchronous disk I/O using APIs like io_uring is to manage when and where blocking of tasks for I/O occurs.  When you know where blocking I/O gets done, you can make it part of your main event loop. If you don't know when or where blocking occurs (be it on I/O or mutexes or other such things), you're forced to make up for it by increasing the size of your thread pool.  But larger thread pools come with a penalty: task switches are expensive!  Scheduling is expensive!  AVX 512 registers alone are 2KB of state per task, and if a thread hasn't run for a while, you're probably missing on your L1 and L2 caches.  That's pure overhead baked into the thread pool architecture that you can entirely avoid by using an event driven architecture. All the high performance systems I've worked on use event driven architectures -- from various network protocol implementations (protocols like BGP on JunOS, the HA functionality) to high speed (persistent and non-persistent) messaging (at Solace).  It just makes everything easier when you're able to keep threads hot on locked to a single core.  Bonus: when the system is at maximum load, you remain at pretty much the same number of requests per second rather than degrading as the number of threads ready to run starts increasing and wasting your CPU resources needlessly when you need them most. It's hard to believe that the event queue architecture I first encountered on an Amiga in the late 1980s when I was just a kid is still worth knowing today. reply",

Rewriting / refactoring is not that hard once one understands the pattern, and I've done that quite a few times.  Depending on the language, there may be other options.  Doing an mlock() on the memory being used could help, but then it's absolutely necessary to carefully limit how much memory is pinned by such mappings.

For data partitioning - I guess number of rows is not the right metric? Change it to number*avg_size or something?

          "text": "This actually seems like a simple example of memory request vs limit. Request the amount of memory needed to be healthy, you can potentially set the limit higher to account for \"reclaimable cache\". Another way to approach it if you find that there are too many limiting metrics to accurately model things: is you let the workers grab more segments until you determine that they are overloaded. Ideally for this to work though you have some idea that the node is approaching saturation. So for example: keep adding segments as long as the nth percentile response time is under some threshold. The advantage of this approach is you don't necessarily have to know which resource (memory, filehandles, etc) is at capacity. You don't even necessarily have to have deep knowledge of linux memory management. You just have to be able to probe the system to determine if it's healthy. I can even go backwards with a binary split mechanism. You sort of bring up a node that owns [A-H] (8 segments in this case). If that fails bring up 2 nodes that own [A-D],[E-H], if that fails, all the way down to one segment per node. reply",

          "text": "It's not clear whether you're using Kubernetes, but the Kubernetes way of dealing with this problem is to declare a memory reservation (i.e., a request) along with the container specification. The amount of the reservation will be deducted from the host's available memory for scheduling purposes, regardless of whether the container actually consumes the reserved amount. It's also a best practice to configure the memory limit to be identical to the reservation, so if the container exceeds the reserved amount, the kernel will terminate it via the OOM killer. Of course, for this to work, you have to figure out what that reserved amount should be. That is an exercise for the implementer (i.e., you). See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-res... >  Attempting to enumerate every resource variable (CPU, IOPS, RSS, Disk, logical count) into a single scoring function feels like an NP-hard trap. Yeah, don't do that. Figure out what resources your applications need and the declare them, and let the scheduler find the best node based on the requirements you've specified. > We are trying to write a \"God Equation\" for our load balancer. We started with row_count, which failed. We looked at disk usage, but that doesn't correlate with RAM because of lazy loading. A few things come to mind... First, you're talking about a load balancer, but it's not clear that you're trying to balance load! A good metric to use for load balancing is one whose value is proportional to response latency. It smells like you're trying to provision resources based on an optimistic prediction of your working set size. Perhaps you need a more pessimistic prediction. It might also be that you're relying too heavily on the kernel to handle paging, when what you really need is a cache tuned for your application that is scan-resistant, coupled with O_DIRECT for I/O. reply",

          "text": "AI music is completely and utterly pointless, just like any other type of AI 'art'. Art is inherently a human activity, and moving the creation of it to computers removes the entire point of it. Maybe it could be OK if it was a small part of larger workflow, but even then it just feels gross. Im not even completely against AI, i find them useful while coding and solving work problems, or even for explaining things. But it should stay far away from any art form. But its most likely a lost battle. Looking at current improvements, i wont be surprised if in 5 to 10 years large parts of new movies and shows  will be AI generated and it will be basically impossible to evade it all unless you stick to anything made before 2023 or so. reply",

Market data ingest, analysis and resulting order execution is chewing through way more data way faster than any banking transaction system. I have worked on both of them.

There are plenty of financial systems that takes days or weeks to fully process transactions. You're probably referring to stock trading systems (which by their nature have to be extremely low latency). The term to search for is \"HFT\" (high-frequency trading).

          "text": "Everything Adobe. Customer support is just a forum where 98% of the offered \"fixes\" for bugs in their software is \"revert to previous version\" or \"reset your preferences\". I swear everyone at that company doesn't even use their own products because for every one thing they fix, two new things break. Functionality of some things don't make sense. There is zero reason to have Media Encoder be its own separate program when it can be integrated into Premiere and AE on its own, which can repeatedly cause connection/bug issues if they're not able to sync properly (also not being up to date on newer file container types which it should offer). Which also leads into the problem of separating everything into more and more different programs to milk every cent. On top of the massive cancellation fees they try to stick to people and KEEP trying to force cloud saving onto everyone so you become reliant on keeping your sub to keep access to files. It's unfortunately become industry standard and while there are other/free options they're not as up to par on capabilities just yet for top tier level for an entire creative suite of work. Currently it's around $700/yr per user. Shutterstock is $1500/yr per seat for level I use, with frustrating UX in search function and now you have to pay for a subscription, and then pay even MORE if you want to use anything they deem to be \"highly desirable\" like Amazon. Oh you have a subscription? Well to get access to what you see here you have to subscribe even more. They added AI content which is chock full of AI slop and copyright issues which clearly isn't being moderated. They also have a ton of vector files which werent checked at all because they're just JPGs saved in vector containers, making them pretty much unusable. Also suffer frequent outrages/download issues that take hours to resolve which clearly is an issue when people have deadlines. reply",

The files are properly corrupted - can't view them on other devices either. I checked some out in a hex editor and sure enough there is a good chunk of null bytes in the beginning. Sometimes it's just the first byte and changing it from 00 to FF fixes the image. But oftentimes it's a whole lot more 00s to the point where I don't know how to recover the image.<p>I've been using only Pixel a-series phones for the last couple years (3a, 6a, 9a) and had this happen on all of them. It surely can't be bad storage, can it? I feel like there is a bug in some part of Google's Android OS.<p>Has anyone of you encountered this issue? I can't believe I'm alone with it.</p></p></div>",

Those jobs have been everything from startups, to boring stable small and medium  “lifestyle companies”, to boring big enterprise, to $BigTech and now I work in customer facing cloud consulting as a staff consultant. And I’ve never seen a market this shitty.  Even after the dot com bust if you were a regular old enterprise dev - and at the time I had 4 years of experience as a Windows developer in Atlanta - it was easy to find a job. 2009-2011 was a shit show but it wasn’t that bad. While I did find a job quickly after being Amazon’ed in 2023 and again last year, things have gutted worse since then. My only strategy is to keep our fixed living expenses way down (less than half my income and I’m the only one working by choice), stay out of debt, keep a years saving in the bank, keep my resume updated and a longer form career document [1], keep my skillset in line with the market (I lead   a lot of “AI” related non chatbot projects) and keep a strong network. I feel a tinge of FOMO knowing that an intern I mentored while they were an intern an a year after coming back makes a little more than I make.  They are 25 and a mid level  SA at AWS - similar to what I do. I have to think about the story of the “Mexican Fisherman”. https://bemorewithless.com/the-story-of-the-mexican-fisherma...

I read somewhere that when women started working in the war efforts, businesses took advantage and skewed home prices and whatnot to make it so women had no choice but to continue working. This worked out well, because women wanted to work and have similar social treatment as men. The issue then is that things kept skewing to the point where today a childless couple with high paying jobs can barely afford a vehicle and tiny apartment. This may or may not be accurate.

          "text": "“ the husband was the sole bread winner, kept his job for most of his life, and could afford the house, car, 4 children and a few pets.” We don’t _forget_ this.  We refute it.  It’s not true.  It’s a dream that real estate developers _sold_ that wasn’t real. In 1975 the women’s labor participation rate stood right around 50% its around 55% now [0]. In 1975 the US home ownership rate was 65%, its 65% now [1]. There were more families with no cars in the 70s than now. 1 and 2 car families were about the same rate (with more 2 car families now) but the big difference is how many more families have more than 2 cars now than then [2]. More stats for you:\n- food as a percentage of family budget is lower now than then (and the only reason its close is that we eat out way more now)[3]\n- houses are bigger now than then[4]\n- data on employee tenure doesn’t go back that far, but the data we do have to the 80s shows employee tenure hasn’t changed [5] There are lots of interesting economic challenges now, but _generally_ more people now are living better lives than then past economically.  Anyone that sells you some story about some glorious past is lying to you for some reason. Home ownership rates are always the tell.  The US had very stable home ownership rates in the 45% range until the New Deal efforts that started subsidizing like crazy home ownership. They rose in the post war era until about 1960 when they reached the mid 60s.  They have fluctuated in a tight curve in that band since then.  The home ownership rate is tightly correlated to mortgage rates, not generational values, and spikes in 2005 (right before the bubble burst) not in the dim past [6].

So people who are good at managing money, who tend to avoid credit, don't get a chance to demonstrate good -credit- management and hence end up with a low score. This is one reason why getting a credit card, using it, and then paying it off in full every month is a valuable thing to do. So for all the good money managers out there, be even smarter - build a good credit management history as a side effect of your good money management. That'll pay off in the long run. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I am doing a PhD in R1 public uni on Computer Engineering in the USA. PhD is something I really wanted to do because it allows me to dive deep into stuff. Turns out what I thought initially was not the whole story.<p>I am nearing the end of second year of my PhD. My advisor is in HPC but doesn't do hot research and I want to do efficient hardware AI research (faster kernels, ML systems etc). But whenever I read papers and see the authors and what they have accomplished and the team behind them and the prestigious schools/labs doing them while I am deep in some cuBLAS function hoping to optimize register tiling to be a nanosecond faster, I feel like a failure. I don't know what problems to work on. I wonder if what I want to do even requires a PhD.<p>I question if I will ever be able to do anything publishable as the labs in MIT/Stanford, their cohort of brilliant minds basically alone? There's so much out there that I don't know. The more I think I know the more stuffs keep popping up. I thought I had finally understood LLMs to their nitty gritty details but then there's even more new variants of attentions popping up. I am not sure if I will be able to read everything needed to be able to research. I want to be able to get a job in the US after my PhD(home is terrifying) and I am an international  so quiting is not an option.<p>I am looking for any advice or if you were in a similar boat anything would be helpful. Thank you.</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "That is the second year of a PhD - the first year you're distracted by your literature survey of the area you're interested in. The second year is where you're trying to dig out a little niche that you can work in and expand the knowledge of what's there. The third year is where you're supposed to be writing up, but in reality you're probably still working on building up enough new knowledge in the area to actually write up. It's not uncommon to feel the way you are during the second and third years - my advice is to recognise how you're feeling and then work out how to push forward (which is what you've already started to do). My advice for how you can compete with large research projects full of postdocs is, don't try to.  You're not in competition with them, you are doing your own research.  It might be in a tiny niche area, but it's your area and it's new knowledge. reply",

For example, at one of the orgs I worked my team lead was based in (and native to) a country in the south of Africa. While hammering out a big feature req he told us, based in Europe, through Teams text chat he wouldn't be around for a few hours because he wanted to take a afternoon nap. We thought he was just joking around, and we needed his opinions a little while later because of something we ran into so we tried to dial him in: no response. Chat: no response. Turns out the guy was really off taking an afternoon nap. Luckily we could solve things without his help, but to us in Europe that was really weird. Later we did some research and discovered that people in that part of the world really like to take afternoon naps, even though they should be at work... reply",

But most people wouldn't be able to speak these languages, so we mostly used English. The customer was often Indonesian and would write bug reports in the language. The non-Indo speakers would just run them through Google translate and comment what they understood and those who were native speakers would correct them if they were mistaken. Especially when there's sarcasm or some cultural context. There were a few who only spoke the Chinese dialects, and we'd use an intermediary in meetings, and AI/Google translate on text and code. This was also a good use of AI - it was fluent in whatever language, Java or Mandarin and could piece them together well. Anyway, yeah, it's workable. Nobody knows all the languages. In engineering, there's more empathy for this, especially from the multilinguals. reply",

Don't rush it 2- Its fine to formulate what you want to say in your mind before saying it. take your time. 3- Use a phone and record yourself speaking about different subject. Practice, practice and practice. 4- Some audiences are harder than others. French people for example tend to nitpick and want you to be really fluent. While most english speakers are fine with your speaking, but it depends on the audience and who you are speaking to. 5- You obviously need to immerse yourself in the language you want to speak. Tv-shows, Movies, News and even tabloid. The latter is actuallt good to understand jokes, innuendos and other subtle conversations. One thing I also noted, is that if you follow/watch people who are not native speakers, they actually tend to explain things/concepts better. Because they are limited in words and have limited scope compared to native speaker. Anyone remarked this? reply",

          "text": "I have worn hearing aids since childhood in the '90s.  Moderate sloping to profound loss.  Been through all the tech since the equalized analog era. For a while now, like the last 15 to 20 years, since hearing aids went DSP, I had not been much impressed by each new generation.  At the risk of sounding like a bit of an advertisement, that changed this year. I have the new Oticon Intent.  RIC style aid.  They have some of the best spatial awareness I've experienced.    They're capable of quite a lot of directionality - accelerometer and three microphones in each.   I had to have the intensity of the directionality turned down a bit.  It was startling me when I turned my head and I wasn't hearing things behind me enough.  But that's at the expense of less signal due to more environmental noise. The machine-learning based noise reduction is an improvement over the previous generations, too. They have a music mode.  It drops all the speech remapping and noise reduction and just makes it feel loud.  It's some sort of perceptual algorithm: in my case as I turn up the volume it gets more and more treble, because only at the loudest volumes would I hear those high frequencies.  All while being power limited at 95 dB SPL so I know I'm not blowing my ears.  I used to wear over-the-ear headphones for that but I now prefer the hearing aids.   It's nice to not worry about if it's too loud. reply",

          "text": "Just as a tip, shouting or even just speaking more loudly is rarely necessary if someone has (properly configured) hearing aids.  Just speak clearly.  Ensuring proper enunciation so they can read lips is usually more important.  Hearing aids will make it \"loud enough\" but they won't clean up the information. Does she have primarily high frequency loss?  High frequency loss is the most typical in the elderly and also from damage from noise exposure. Different people have different voices.  I usually find it easier to understand men because I hear the lower frequencies better, especially without my hearing aids but also with them.   And it's always easier to understand people you know well compared to strangers. I find small speakers to be awful.  The high frequencies are distorted and tinny.  Scratchy is a good way to put it.  I have a very hard time understanding anything played through a smartphone or tablet speaker.  The speaker is too small to reproduce the bass frequencies I can hear the best, and so it's just TSSST TSSSSSZZT sounds through my hearing aids. I cannot wear my hearing aids at full volume at the dinner table or while working in the kitchen for this reason.  Metal, plastic and paper are also common offenders.   CLINK.  CLINK.  CRSZZST.  It's almost painful and headache inducing if I'm tired. Unfortunately those high frequencies are what carry speech sounds like sh, t, ch and so on.  Without those it's like the adults talking in the Charlie Brown cartoons.  \"wah-womp-wah-wah-mhuh??\" Hearing aids can do two things for this: one is to take some of that high frequency information and remap it to lower frequencies.  This is part of why they say you won't like wearing your hearing aids when you first get them.  They're systematically distorting what you hear -- but in a way you might eventually learn to interpret. The other is just to make it loud enough that it can be heard.  And as you suggest that may be the limit of the hearing capacity if there's very little at the high frequencies the only way to make something high frequency to be perceived, is to hammer the ear with a 90 or 100 dB level of sound. It's absolutely worth having them adjusted a bit.  Also every manufacturer uses a different algorithm for speech frequency remapping.  Some people have strong preferences by brand as to the hearing aid sound.  (Phonak and Oticon certainly have different \"feels\" in my experience.) Almost all hearing aids allow multiple \"configuration profiles\" where you can switch through them with the app or buttons.  I have four: general, lecture, comfort, music.  Comfort mode just nukes the high end and cranks up the noise reduction.  That's what I use if I'm just reading alone in the living room, or when out at the grocery store, etc. As to large groups, personally I've simply conceded I can't do large groups.  If I try I will feel left out and get depressed over it.  If people want to see me at a family reunion, for example, after I do a brief tour to say hi to everyone, they'll have to join me for a small group chat in the den or whatnot. reply",

          "text": "Here's a crazy idea.  I personally prefer the fidelity of an active ambient in-ear monitor (IEM), as used by musicians on stage over the best hearing aids.  Once a year, I do a monthly trial with the latest hearing aid models and IMO the fidelity (especially low-end) and the comfort just is not there compared with the best active ambient IEMs.  The difference between hearing aids and IEMs is blurring, but they are not yet fully interchangeable. Standard IEMs isolate you from the world, which is the opposite of what a hearing aid does. However, a specific category called \"Active Ambient\" IEMs bridges this gap.  These are IEMs with embedded high-fidelity microphones on the outer shell. They pick up the sound of the room (bandmates, crowd, conductor), amplify it, and blend it with your monitor mix.  The accompanying bodypack or app often includes a multi-band EQ and Limiter. You can boost specific frequencies where you have hearing loss (e.g., boosting highs to hear cymbals or speech clearly) and set a volume ceiling to protect your remaining hearing.  I have no ownership/sponsorship in the product, but I personally LOVE the ASI Audio 3DME (powered by Sensaphonics), which is the industry standard for this. [1] It allows you to use an app to shape the ambient sound to your hearing needs. The Pros: It provides hearing protection + monitoring + hearing enhancement in one device. The Cons (Why they aren't daily hearing aids): 1) Form Factor: You are tethered to a belt pack. You likely won't wear a wired bodypack to a grocery store or dinner party. 2) Social Barrier: Wearing full-shell custom IEMs creates a \"do not disturb\" look that discourages conversation in social settings.  This can be more socially alienating than a comparatively inconspicuous hearing aid. 3) Battery Life: IEM systems typically last 6–8 hours, whereas hearing aid batteries can last days or weeks.

          "text": "Power requirements, moving mass and audio sampling and processing. Hearing aids run on tiny voltages (typically ~1.4 Volts). They are designed to amplify speech (a small frequency range) at moderate volumes.  An IEM is designed to handle the massive energy of a live drum kit without distortion. To do this, the internal amplifier needs Headroom. It likely steps up the battery voltage significantly (internally converting to higher voltage rails) to ensure that when a snare drum hits 120dB, the amplifier has enough electrical height to reproduce that spike without clipping. Hearing aids use microscopic balanced armature receivers that require almost zero power to move because they are only moving a tiny amount of air near your eardrum.  IEMs use dual-driver miniature subwoofers and tweeters that are physically larger and heavier. It takes significantly more electrical current to push these drivers back and forth. Hearing aids often use aggressive battery-saving tricks, such as lowering the sampling rate or \"sleeping\" processes when silence is detected.  The processor of an IEM is running wide open 100% of the time. It is constantly digitizing the world at a high sampling rate to ensure zero latency. If it tried to save battery by \"sleeping\" between notes, you would hear a delay (latency), which would make it impossible to play in time. reply",

          "text": "Let’s try some actual numbers. A fancy passive IEM quotes: > Sensitivity: 114 dB-SPL (@ 0.1V) That’s on the high side for an IEM.  Let’s be conservative and say it’s actually 100dB SPL at 1mW (which is on the low side) and that the user has hearing loss and the IEM is actually outputting 90dB continuously (I’m not an expert but this seems high. Certainly I would not set an active IEM anywhere near that loud, even at a concert).  That’s 0.1mW of electrical power to each IEM, for 0.2mW total.  This part could run for days on a small battery pack. A modern amplifier might as well be 100% efficient, although that body pack could easily be some wildly efficient Class A design. Let’s suppose the DSP is processing 96kSPS (might as well minimize latency and the need for a complex antialiasing setup and let’s assume it’s using a duper-high-fidelity FIR filter that’s a whole 100ms long, i.e. 9600 taps, and that the FIR implementation is pure brute force, so there are 9600 times 96k FMAs per second.  That’s about 2 billion FMAs per second for both ears.  (Again, this is a ridiculous way to do this.)  The fancy nonlinear compression stuff will be negligible in comparison. From some quick Googling, you could easily spend a whole watt on the DSP. And there’s where all that battery charge goes :) I bet that someone who really cared about optimizing this could put some software engineering into getting DSP power down below 50mW.  Either use an FFT to optimize the filter or use a much lower complexity filter bank. reply",

It got a couple of words wrong here and there, usually proper names or acronyms but it was generally quite impressive, and much better than the \"text to speech\" efforts last time I really tried them years ago. reply",

          "text": "Thanks! I have hearing aids too and, while I don't have profound hearing loss (severe one side, moderate the other), it's got to the point where I am starting to look at other solutions to supplement them. For those not aware: hearing aids are not like eyeglasses, where you can effectively have your vision restored to 20/20 with the right prescription. They help, but they don't get you up to the level of a person with ordinary hearing. This goes particularly for situations with high background noise, multiple voices, etc.: restaurants, bars, parties and other places where social life tends to happen. Your recommendation has made me think I should finally take the leap on live-caption glasses, which I've been watching for a while now. It sounds like they've finally got to the point where they're effective. A question: how do you find them in conversations with multiple people? Do the glasses help you distinguish speakers by breaking out text from different voices, or is it all just a stream of words? What if there are multiple conversations going on - do the glasses manage to \"focus\" captioning on the one you're closest to, or do other conversations creep in? The captions on google meet have been useful for me as well, although I do wish they were more configurable, e.g. being able to give the captioning model a list of technical phrases, internal company terms, or acronyms that are likely to come up. There also seems to be a gap still between real time transcription, which is good, and after-the-fact transcription, which is excellent. (You can also use an LLM for the latter and prompt it yourself with extra context, although that may not be the best model.) It's been great to see so much progress in this area in the past few years. I am hoping the current (over-)investment in AI at least has the side effect of improving the tech still further. reply",

What if there are multiple conversations going on - do the glasses manage to \"focus\" captioning on the one you're closest to, or do other conversations creep in? It really depends if people are talking at the same time or not. If in a close group (space matters, the mic only goes ~2-3m), one person talking at a time, then they're great. That's the setup I most often have at conferences, so it's been great there. In evenings/parties, it's a bit more chaotic, and the glasses tend to fall off for sure. Regarding distinguishing different speakers etc I haven't needed that, I use the glasses as a helper, they fill in the gaps. So it's \"just a stream of words\", but it has been enough to already help a ton. The directional mic does work quite well, but sometimes you have just 2 conversations happening in front of you and it's not working at all. In other setups (especially professional ones), people usually speak one at a time and it works great. reply",

They are not making it clear how the captioning is happening, but since they don't claim it'll continue working even if the company disappears/shuts down, one can be safe to assume it's a cloud product, meaning it won't actually be a good fit for most people out there with a limited amount of money to spend on things like these.

          "text": "I'll tell you what is NOT hot! I have Phonak Audeos paired over bluetooth with my iPhone.  A few years prior, I used to have Oticon, also paired with my iPhone. With the Oticon, if I made a cellphone call, the iPhone would use the default iPhone microphone while the audio would stream to my hearing aids.  It was good that way because in a noisy environment I could hold the iphone right up to my mouth and the other party would be able to hear what I was saying. With the newer Phonaks, I was very disappointed to find that the new hearing aids would only use the microphone input that is built into the hearing aids themselves, and not the iPhone mic input.  I discovered this when I realised that talking directly into iPhone mic did not make it any easier for the other party to hear me. I complained to my Audiologist who explained that yes, the new hearing aids were copying the behaviour of Apple AirPods, which also have the mic input on the earpod itself, and that there was no way at all to configure the Phonaks to use the iPhone mic input instead. Why is this a problem you might ask?  Because my hearing aids are Behind The Ear (BTE) and thus the mic input on the hearing aid is a good 4 inches away from my face and thus my voice cannot possibly sound as clear as when I could speak directly into an iPhone mic. When I next replace my hearing aids, I shall look for aids that do not mimic this crappy AirPods behaviour... reply",

Even the next generation Philips  9050 that supported Auracast didnt support this. We ended up with Phonaks rebranded as Sennheisers. The audio quality during calls may not be as clear as a separate mic (what i believe you refer to as oticon), but from a user experience its nice to not have to fish out your phone to answer a call or wonder why you can hear the other person but they cant hear you.

It’s a brain thing, my hearing itself is above average for my age (40), so I’m not sure what exactly can be done, but there was an article many years ago about someone (Bose?) working on aids for that issue, no idea what came of it. I guess all modern hearing aids have some focus mode.

Sound is slow, and readily susceptible to real-time triangulation. The math/processing is much easier if the parallaxes are fixed (eg the microphones are arranged in a line array on the top band of a rigid pair of smart glasses), but with a little latency it's not prohibitive for a deformable array to solve for its own relative position as well. reply",

But it's not a fix.  I'm still mostly lost in noise. People rely on the (usually very large) dynamic range of hearing to be able to understand in those situations.  In people with typical hearing the brain filters out the sounds too loud or too quiet to be what they are trying to listen to.  But hearing aids act as compressors reducing the dynamic range. reply",

I find the sound quality in noisy environments much better than any other aid I’ve had - much better perception of voices in restaurants, for example. I rarely have to fiddle with the volume control and in fact do not even use any other settings than the main program - I find that whatever the core program is doing tends to be basically what I want. I also very much appreciate that they can natively connect to iPhones (this is also essentially the main reason I have an iPhone). This makes phone calls and music and podcasts very easy. (Whereas up until 2017, I used to dread phone calls.) I actually tried Phonaks briefly in 2022 and hated them. Lots of controls to fiddle with (some with oddly unintuitive names), but that meant I was constantly trying to adjust it and was rarely able to just exist in the moment. I found them markedly worse in noisy environments - I basically couldn’t have a conversation in a restaurant. reply",

          "text": "Audiologist and hearing aid user here. It's a great time to be looking for new hearing aids! Speech in noise capabilities have improved massively this generation, and I can personally attest to this. For me, the most important performance metric is speech perception in noisy / challenging listening situations. For you there might be other considerations, so keep that in mind. With that said, my recommendation are the new Phonak Infinio Sphere devices with with their \"Spheric speech in noise\" feature. It's a complete game changer in terms of speech perception in loud noise. Activating this program in a noisy situation feels like turning off the background noise, leaving only (nearby) voices. The caveat is that to achieve this they use a separate, power-hungry processor and compensate by increasing the battery size (making the whole hearing aid bigger than other, similar hearing aids). The upside to this is that if you're _not_ using the spherical program, you'll have really good battery life. I use mine for exactly 16 hours a day and if I'm careful I can make them last almost three full days. The charger is much better than the previous ones; they use magnets to keep the devices in place instead of relying on plastic friction. The Oticon Intent and new Starkey AI aids are also great. You should always try more than one model before you make a decision. Happy to answer any questions! reply",

          "text": "I have the Widex SmartRIC 220, and would buy them again. They are comfortable, have musical audio quality (Widex works with musicians), very low latency (reducing comb filter effect), and in general look and feel very professional. As for technology, they use bluetooth low energy to connect to the smart phone, which works really well, with the caveat that the range is quite low and if it is in the pocket and you are moving around, media sound will often disrupt or desync intermittently. On the plus side, they last well over a day even with media use (WIdex says they last 37 hours without bluetooth use and that checks out). The case provides charge for about a week, and has wireless and usb-c charging. They are quite pricey, but there are several options (110, 220, 330, 440), and the 220 were more than enough for me. The app has several modes, including directional focus mode, and you can define your own. I sometimes use a different mode for listening to concert music, that disables most filters such as volume protection. I am wearing them for 9 months now, and there was no situation (concerts, traveling, work, sports, etc) were they gave me any issues whatsoever. reply",

I tried Phonaks and found that the use of Bluetooth to connect to my iPhone was painfully flakey (there were certain locations in my neighborhood that every time I walked in front of a particular house, I would lose audio). I ended up returning them and the only MfI hearing aids the audiologist I went to (I was limited by what was in-network by my insurance and while the old insurance covered equally in-network and out, my new insurance covered 0% out of network so I was going to be looking at double the price to go to Costco). I ended up with Resound which are essentially the same as the Jabras. The one thing that I find absolutely essential is using ear molds instead of domes. My cousin hated ear molds and gave up on them, but I definitely prefer them. Incidentally, I would recommend the HA/hearing loss subreddits (r/HearingAids and r/hardofhearing) over HN for this discussion. The HA group can get a little rigid, but I really like the community at HoH. reply",

This site is specifically a salon where a bunch of pseudonymous \"too smart\" nerds opine about topics that stimulate their curiosity, following guidelines on best-intent and good-faith that are essentially debate rules. Sometimes, amidst those discussions, you'll witness seemingly personal anecdotes or seemingly insider insights, which you should always be taking as a grain of salt, used only to drive (or repel) your own curiosity and desire for more discussion and debate. It's not a great place for earnest politics, activism, or anything so serious and existential. And because it doesn't aim to be, it doesn't beg for disclosures like location. As long as you can \"talk the talk\" here, and follow the guidelines, you're welcome to participate in the discussion how you'd like, without being measured by your person, its history, or its geography. Its great to have a place like that online. reply",

It's trivial to fake geographic location observed through source IP addresses (or even RTT multilateration) but much harder to fake time zones a user is active within, particularly if monitoring latency of replies. edit: To further clarify, I don't think a contributions calendar would be beneficial to HN either. I've never cared to think about the country a commenter resides in, and don't care about username/real name either unless the commenter is appealing to their own authority (e.g. \"I am the author of this software\"). Even then, the usefulness of an appeal to own authority is often limited to the ability to reverse lookup the user's personal website (which itself is proven to be notable from other sources) for a link back to their HN profile.

Post history for each account is already visible, so if you have an agenda, it sticks out like a sore thumb there. Moderation: Won't meaningfully impact moderation. HN can already see this info and they are the ones that take moderator action. It may hurt moderation/increase moderation costs because people may tend more to report content based on country instead of content. Transparency: Outright influencer content (political or corporate) doesn't make it to the front page enough for it to matter, or if it does, I can't tell. Anti-abuse: Same as moderation. Abuse reports should be processed based on content and not country of origin. Meaningfully improves discussion quality: If a story is about something happening in a particular country, people who look like they are from that country might get asked more or different questions. This puts people from that country on the spot. They may get increased unsolicited communication or thread hijacks. Right now, if someone wants to be on that spot, they can voluntarily identify, either in the profile or in the post. Possibly something useful would be a rule/requirement that claiming to be from a country different than the one you made an account from--seen either in a profile or post--requires verification for further posting, but if you never make such a contrary claim, the verification is not needed. reply",

Frankly, due to the strict guidlines here I suspect most state sponsored trolls would stick to places like Reddit where it's easier to disrupt things with contentious posts. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">We’re hitting a classic distributed systems wall and I’m looking for war stories or \"least worst\" practices.<p>The Context: We maintain a distributed stateful engine (think search/analytics). The architecture is standard: a Control Plane (Coordinator) assigns data segments to Worker Nodes. The workload involves heavy use of mmap and lazy loading for large datasets.<p>The Incident: We had a cascading failure where the Coordinator got stuck in a loop, DDOS-ing a specific node.<p>The Signal: Coordinator sees Node A has significantly fewer rows (logical count) than the cluster average. It flags Node A as \"underutilized.\"<p>The Action: Coordinator attempts to rebalance/load new segments onto Node A.<p>The Reality: Node A is actually sitting at 197GB RAM usage (near OOM). The data on it happens to be extremely wide (fat rows, huge blobs), so its logical row count is low, but physical footprint is massive.<p>The Loop: Node A rejects the load (or times out). The Coordinator ignores the backpressure, sees the low row count again, and retries immediately.<p>The Core Problem: We are trying to write a \"God Equation\" for our load balancer. We started with row_count, which failed. We looked at disk usage, but that doesn't correlate with RAM because of lazy loading.<p>Now we are staring at mmap. Because the OS manages the page cache, the application-level RSS is noisy and doesn't strictly reflect \"required\" memory vs \"reclaimable\" cache.<p>The Question: Attempting to enumerate every resource variable (CPU, IOPS, RSS, Disk, logical count) into a single scoring function feels like an NP-hard trap.<p>How do you handle placement in systems where memory usage is opaque/dynamic?<p>Dumb Coordinator, Smart Nodes: Should we just let the Coordinator blind-fire based on disk space, and rely 100% on the Node to return hard 429 Too Many Requests based on local pressure?<p>Cost Estimation: Do we try to build a synthetic \"cost model\" per segment (e.g., predicted memory footprint) and schedule based on credits, ignoring actual OS metrics?<p>Control Plane Decoupling: Separate storage balancing (disk) from query balancing (mem)?<p>Feels like we are reinventing the wheel. References to papers or similar architecture post-mortems appreciated.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "There's a simple solution: don't use mmap().  There's a reason that databases use O_DIRECT to read into their own in memory cache.  If it was Good Enough for Oracle in the 1990s, it's probably Good Enough for you. mmap() is one of those things that looks like it's an easy solution when you start writing an application, but that's only because you don't know the complexity time bomb of what you're undertaking. The entire point of the various ways of performing asynchronous disk I/O using APIs like io_uring is to manage when and where blocking of tasks for I/O occurs.  When you know where blocking I/O gets done, you can make it part of your main event loop. If you don't know when or where blocking occurs (be it on I/O or mutexes or other such things), you're forced to make up for it by increasing the size of your thread pool.  But larger thread pools come with a penalty: task switches are expensive!  Scheduling is expensive!  AVX 512 registers alone are 2KB of state per task, and if a thread hasn't run for a while, you're probably missing on your L1 and L2 caches.  That's pure overhead baked into the thread pool architecture that you can entirely avoid by using an event driven architecture. All the high performance systems I've worked on use event driven architectures -- from various network protocol implementations (protocols like BGP on JunOS, the HA functionality) to high speed (persistent and non-persistent) messaging (at Solace).  It just makes everything easier when you're able to keep threads hot on locked to a single core.  Bonus: when the system is at maximum load, you remain at pretty much the same number of requests per second rather than degrading as the number of threads ready to run starts increasing and wasting your CPU resources needlessly when you need them most. It's hard to believe that the event queue architecture I first encountered on an Amiga in the late 1980s when I was just a kid is still worth knowing today. reply",

There are insanely dirty hacks that you could do to start controlling the fallout of the page faults (like playing games with userfaultfd), but they're unmaintainable in the long term as they introduce a fragility that results in unexpected complexity at the worst possible times (bugs).  Rewriting / refactoring is not that hard once one understands the pattern, and I've done that quite a few times.  Depending on the language, there may be other options.  Doing an mlock() on the memory being used could help, but then it's absolutely necessary to carefully limit how much memory is pinned by such mappings.

We looked at disk usage, but that doesn't correlate with RAM because of lazy loading. I'm a big fan of straight up even distribution of requests. It's simple and predictable, although it's not going to get you the best throughput, predictability and simplicity is often better than perfection. If you always send each node 1/Nth of requests, worst case of a node that is broken but looks up is that you're still sending it a share when it should get nothing; if you have some sort of utilization based metric, if it looks underutilized because it's just dropping requests and responding with success but empty, it sucks up all your requests. Alternatively, people have good results with select M nodes by metrics, and then random selection between those.

          "text": "This actually seems like a simple example of memory request vs limit. Request the amount of memory needed to be healthy, you can potentially set the limit higher to account for \"reclaimable cache\". Another way to approach it if you find that there are too many limiting metrics to accurately model things: is you let the workers grab more segments until you determine that they are overloaded. Ideally for this to work though you have some idea that the node is approaching saturation. So for example: keep adding segments as long as the nth percentile response time is under some threshold. The advantage of this approach is you don't necessarily have to know which resource (memory, filehandles, etc) is at capacity. You don't even necessarily have to have deep knowledge of linux memory management. You just have to be able to probe the system to determine if it's healthy. I can even go backwards with a binary split mechanism. You sort of bring up a node that owns [A-H] (8 segments in this case). If that fails bring up 2 nodes that own [A-D],[E-H], if that fails, all the way down to one segment per node. reply",

It's also a best practice to configure the memory limit to be identical to the reservation, so if the container exceeds the reserved amount, the kernel will terminate it via the OOM killer.

You may be thinking of high frequency trading. In that case, traders interact directly with an exchange - e.g. via direct market access[1] - so it’s a pre-established two-party interaction. There’s no particular technical difficulty with making that fast. Usually, slow transaction times are a consequence of the structure of the market, not a technical issue particularly.

Many pieces of the puzzle need to interact correctly to remove latency, from physical location, network gear, decision about where software runs, removing unnecessary layers of everything , to algos and data structures, and doing razor-tight tradeoff analysis favoring low-latency at every step along the way.

My point is really that if transactions are taking minutes to complete, that's likely to be a social/structural problem, not a technical one. With today's technology and all the work in this space, it's not particularly technically difficult to get such times down into the seconds or milliseconds, depending on the constraints. Yes, HFT has gone to extremes to get trade execution times down as low as microseconds. And sure, that involves technical challenges. But they're mostly sort of obvious ones - you mentioned some of the major categories - that yield to throwing engineering talent at. But I was referring to the Pareto 80% of gains here. reply",

There are plenty of financial systems that takes days or weeks to fully process transactions. You're probably referring to stock trading systems (which by their nature have to be extremely low latency). The term to search for is \"HFT\" (high-frequency trading).

I'll try to articulate my reasons as follows: - In every authentication system (the airports' face scanning ones and others) there's a point at which a yes/no decision must be made: is this person authentic or is not? - This yes/no \"decision module\" must base its determination solely on a series of bits presented to it by the image sensor. - Every series of bits can be spoofed because the decision module can't tell whether the bits originated from a real image sensor or from a very convincing AI or elsewhere. The only exception to this is when the bits include a cryptographic signature, generated using a private key, securely embedded within the image sensor. - The chance of such spoofing is minuscule if the sensor and the decision module coexist within a single piece of hardware that's tamper-proof. The decision module for airport face scanners can't be, given the large number of faces that must be queried. When such a decision module and its image sensor are separated by a network, possibilities for intrusion and spoofing can no longer be ignored. - A helpful analogy is how we decry passwords stored as plain text in backend databases; after the inevitable compromise, these passwords get used to attack other systems. If backend systems store face data as a set of images (as I believe most do), how's that different in principle from storing passwords in a DB, in plain text? - I'll grant that a careful designed system will allay my fears. The backend should store nothing but salted hashes and the image sensors must send only signed images of the subject. - Stepping back, my ultimate concern with face authentication systems is that their technical details are opaque and they're used in situations where recourse is limited at best. reply",

I want the CBSA to be recording, databasing, post-analyzing including the ability to feed a photo into their database and know who that is. That's the border. The big question, I'm not sure. Should the data be freedom of information act accessible?

Although if you were a physical location with a high transaction volume, then banks offer better rates than Stripe. Then your actual commerce software.

I've also noticed the website overall becoming very deafeningly pro-AI in the past six months, often using the same idea in my screenshot to boost pro-AI content to the same headline spot or \"above the fold\" at the very least.<p>Are they taking kickbacks somehow? I don't see how a random podcast deserves headline treatment like this unless they got paid or some kind of kickback to promote it. And even then, it's not labeled as promoted content. The whole thing smells fishy to me.</p></p></div>",

We are extra careful about new accounts because we find that it helps us to prevent abuse, and in situations where a new account is somewhere in the grey zone of possibly real or fake, we may ask for additional information, or a PayPal payment, like in this situation. \nIf you choose PayPal, the €20 will go on your account in the form of credit and will automatically be used towards your future invoices. If you decide to cancel your account, and there is credit left on your account, we will refund you for that amount. \nFor the passport (or other documents) -- We have very strict data protection laws here in Germany and the EU. We only use this data to confirm your identity, and after that, it is automatically deleted from our systems after a short time. We have a data protection team who customers can contact if they have any questions at data-protection@hetzner.com. --Katie reply",

What Poopalert does is use smartpipes (toilet drains equipped with smart device tech such as employee biomedical health monitoring) - so it uses smart pipes to see if there is an unflushed toilet.  Then are staff will go flush and clean, so the next guy gets the proper clean experience, and we dock the phantom shitter a small premium for the service which goes to our bonus pool.  Anyway, with the smartpipes we can also tell if an employee is unwell or a risk, basically assess their healthy status, and cull the herd so to speak by firing the bottom 10% least healthy workforce. This will lead to an organization of obedient, respectful, team players, all of which are very healthy - and make our custodial duties - or doodies as it were - much easier!! reply",

The benefit for me is I use the main system to look things up and then switch to the target system and I have the main display as a reference and the other as well, Used to have the side monitor as the KVM one, but find I work better with the switched monitor the one in the center, as a side display I would get sore/tired neck from always looking to the side.

          "text": "Everything Adobe. Customer support is just a forum where 98% of the offered \"fixes\" for bugs in their software is \"revert to previous version\" or \"reset your preferences\". I swear everyone at that company doesn't even use their own products because for every one thing they fix, two new things break. Functionality of some things don't make sense. There is zero reason to have Media Encoder be its own separate program when it can be integrated into Premiere and AE on its own, which can repeatedly cause connection/bug issues if they're not able to sync properly (also not being up to date on newer file container types which it should offer). Which also leads into the problem of separating everything into more and more different programs to milk every cent. On top of the massive cancellation fees they try to stick to people and KEEP trying to force cloud saving onto everyone so you become reliant on keeping your sub to keep access to files. It's unfortunately become industry standard and while there are other/free options they're not as up to par on capabilities just yet for top tier level for an entire creative suite of work. Currently it's around $700/yr per user. Shutterstock is $1500/yr per seat for level I use, with frustrating UX in search function and now you have to pay for a subscription, and then pay even MORE if you want to use anything they deem to be \"highly desirable\" like Amazon. Oh you have a subscription? Well to get access to what you see here you have to subscribe even more. They added AI content which is chock full of AI slop and copyright issues which clearly isn't being moderated. They also have a ton of vector files which werent checked at all because they're just JPGs saved in vector containers, making them pretty much unusable. Also suffer frequent outrages/download issues that take hours to resolve which clearly is an issue when people have deadlines. reply",

The ‘love of craft’ can be enjoyed, whilst you’re having fun, learning and ideating on all kinds of projects, until you hit the mark, tbh. If you’re doing ‘what you love’ as a side hustle while doing a job you don’t particularly like that covers your bills, you’re in a much better position than risking it all on a whim. Even if you are in tech and do get laid-off, you’re much more likely to find something quickly in another space than if there’s a 2-year gap in your resumé. And you can always ‘trade-down’ to a more menial job if you’re desperate, whilst you build your dream. reply",

And I’ve never seen a market this shitty.  Even after the dot com bust if you were a regular old enterprise dev - and at the time I had 4 years of experience as a Windows developer in Atlanta - it was easy to find a job. 2009-2011 was a shit show but it wasn’t that bad. While I did find a job quickly after being Amazon’ed in 2023 and again last year, things have gutted worse since then. My only strategy is to keep our fixed living expenses way down (less than half my income and I’m the only one working by choice), stay out of debt, keep a years saving in the bank, keep my resume updated and a longer form career document [1], keep my skillset in line with the market (I lead   a lot of “AI” related non chatbot projects) and keep a strong network. I feel a tinge of FOMO knowing that an intern I mentored while they were an intern an a year after coming back makes a little more than I make.

When people say things like this, they gloss over the fact that the standard of living, of what most people find acceptable, has gone up dramatically. Average home size has more than doubled, while family size has gone down. Cars have significantly more technology in them. Everyone now needs a $1k smart phone in their pocket. I live in a home from the 1940s. I’m sure at some point there was a family of 5 living here. My dad grew up in a similar home in the 1950s with 6 people in the home. I think you’d be hard pressed to find someone these days who think my house is big enough for a family that size. My parents both have some emotional scars I’ve seen from growing up poor in the idyllic era everyone likes to reference. I think debt has really allowed things to get out of hand. The availability and normalization of using debt for everything has meant companies don’t have to keep prices affordable or pay decent wages, they just need to convince the public that having excessive amounts of personal debt is ok and normal. Then they also create new forms of debt to hide it from people and keep them spending, like BNPL. The idea of living within one’s means has shifted to mean if a person can make the monthly payments. reply",

It’s not true.  It’s a dream that real estate developers _sold_ that wasn’t real. In 1975 the women’s labor participation rate stood right around 50% its around 55% now [0]. In 1975 the US home ownership rate was 65%, its 65% now [1]. There were more families with no cars in the 70s than now. 1 and 2 car families were about the same rate (with more 2 car families now) but the big difference is how many more families have more than 2 cars now than then [2]. More stats for you:\n- food as a percentage of family budget is lower now than then (and the only reason its close is that we eat out way more now)[3]\n- houses are bigger now than then[4]\n- data on employee tenure doesn’t go back that far, but the data we do have to the 80s shows employee tenure hasn’t changed [5] There are lots of interesting economic challenges now, but _generally_ more people now are living better lives than then past economically.  Anyone that sells you some story about some glorious past is lying to you for some reason. Home ownership rates are always the tell.  The US had very stable home ownership rates in the 45% range until the New Deal efforts that started subsidizing like crazy home ownership. They rose in the post war era until about 1960 when they reached the mid 60s.  They have fluctuated in a tight curve in that band since then.  The home ownership rate is tightly correlated to mortgage rates, not generational values, and spikes in 2005 (right before the bubble burst) not in the dim past [6].

So people who are good at managing money, who tend to avoid credit, don't get a chance to demonstrate good -credit- management and hence end up with a low score. This is one reason why getting a credit card, using it, and then paying it off in full every month is a valuable thing to do. So for all the good money managers out there, be even smarter - build a good credit management history as a side effect of your good money management. That'll pay off in the long run. reply",

          "text": "I have worn hearing aids since childhood in the '90s.  Moderate sloping to profound loss.  Been through all the tech since the equalized analog era. For a while now, like the last 15 to 20 years, since hearing aids went DSP, I had not been much impressed by each new generation.  At the risk of sounding like a bit of an advertisement, that changed this year. I have the new Oticon Intent.  RIC style aid.  They have some of the best spatial awareness I've experienced.    They're capable of quite a lot of directionality - accelerometer and three microphones in each.   I had to have the intensity of the directionality turned down a bit.  It was startling me when I turned my head and I wasn't hearing things behind me enough.  But that's at the expense of less signal due to more environmental noise. The machine-learning based noise reduction is an improvement over the previous generations, too. They have a music mode.  It drops all the speech remapping and noise reduction and just makes it feel loud.  It's some sort of perceptual algorithm: in my case as I turn up the volume it gets more and more treble, because only at the loudest volumes would I hear those high frequencies.  All while being power limited at 95 dB SPL so I know I'm not blowing my ears.  I used to wear over-the-ear headphones for that but I now prefer the hearing aids.   It's nice to not worry about if it's too loud. reply",

          "text": "Just as a tip, shouting or even just speaking more loudly is rarely necessary if someone has (properly configured) hearing aids.  Just speak clearly.  Ensuring proper enunciation so they can read lips is usually more important.  Hearing aids will make it \"loud enough\" but they won't clean up the information. Does she have primarily high frequency loss?  High frequency loss is the most typical in the elderly and also from damage from noise exposure. Different people have different voices.  I usually find it easier to understand men because I hear the lower frequencies better, especially without my hearing aids but also with them.   And it's always easier to understand people you know well compared to strangers. I find small speakers to be awful.  The high frequencies are distorted and tinny.  Scratchy is a good way to put it.  I have a very hard time understanding anything played through a smartphone or tablet speaker.  The speaker is too small to reproduce the bass frequencies I can hear the best, and so it's just TSSST TSSSSSZZT sounds through my hearing aids. I cannot wear my hearing aids at full volume at the dinner table or while working in the kitchen for this reason.  Metal, plastic and paper are also common offenders.   CLINK.  CLINK.  CRSZZST.  It's almost painful and headache inducing if I'm tired. Unfortunately those high frequencies are what carry speech sounds like sh, t, ch and so on.  Without those it's like the adults talking in the Charlie Brown cartoons.  \"wah-womp-wah-wah-mhuh??\" Hearing aids can do two things for this: one is to take some of that high frequency information and remap it to lower frequencies.  This is part of why they say you won't like wearing your hearing aids when you first get them.  They're systematically distorting what you hear -- but in a way you might eventually learn to interpret. The other is just to make it loud enough that it can be heard.  And as you suggest that may be the limit of the hearing capacity if there's very little at the high frequencies the only way to make something high frequency to be perceived, is to hammer the ear with a 90 or 100 dB level of sound. It's absolutely worth having them adjusted a bit.  Also every manufacturer uses a different algorithm for speech frequency remapping.  Some people have strong preferences by brand as to the hearing aid sound.  (Phonak and Oticon certainly have different \"feels\" in my experience.) Almost all hearing aids allow multiple \"configuration profiles\" where you can switch through them with the app or buttons.  I have four: general, lecture, comfort, music.  Comfort mode just nukes the high end and cranks up the noise reduction.  That's what I use if I'm just reading alone in the living room, or when out at the grocery store, etc. As to large groups, personally I've simply conceded I can't do large groups.  If I try I will feel left out and get depressed over it.  If people want to see me at a family reunion, for example, after I do a brief tour to say hi to everyone, they'll have to join me for a small group chat in the den or whatnot. reply",

          "text": "Here's a crazy idea.  I personally prefer the fidelity of an active ambient in-ear monitor (IEM), as used by musicians on stage over the best hearing aids.  Once a year, I do a monthly trial with the latest hearing aid models and IMO the fidelity (especially low-end) and the comfort just is not there compared with the best active ambient IEMs.  The difference between hearing aids and IEMs is blurring, but they are not yet fully interchangeable. Standard IEMs isolate you from the world, which is the opposite of what a hearing aid does. However, a specific category called \"Active Ambient\" IEMs bridges this gap.  These are IEMs with embedded high-fidelity microphones on the outer shell. They pick up the sound of the room (bandmates, crowd, conductor), amplify it, and blend it with your monitor mix.  The accompanying bodypack or app often includes a multi-band EQ and Limiter. You can boost specific frequencies where you have hearing loss (e.g., boosting highs to hear cymbals or speech clearly) and set a volume ceiling to protect your remaining hearing.  I have no ownership/sponsorship in the product, but I personally LOVE the ASI Audio 3DME (powered by Sensaphonics), which is the industry standard for this. [1] It allows you to use an app to shape the ambient sound to your hearing needs. The Pros: It provides hearing protection + monitoring + hearing enhancement in one device. The Cons (Why they aren't daily hearing aids): 1) Form Factor: You are tethered to a belt pack. You likely won't wear a wired bodypack to a grocery store or dinner party. 2) Social Barrier: Wearing full-shell custom IEMs creates a \"do not disturb\" look that discourages conversation in social settings.  This can be more socially alienating than a comparatively inconspicuous hearing aid. 3) Battery Life: IEM systems typically last 6–8 hours, whereas hearing aid batteries can last days or weeks.

          "text": "Power requirements, moving mass and audio sampling and processing. Hearing aids run on tiny voltages (typically ~1.4 Volts). They are designed to amplify speech (a small frequency range) at moderate volumes.  An IEM is designed to handle the massive energy of a live drum kit without distortion. To do this, the internal amplifier needs Headroom. It likely steps up the battery voltage significantly (internally converting to higher voltage rails) to ensure that when a snare drum hits 120dB, the amplifier has enough electrical height to reproduce that spike without clipping. Hearing aids use microscopic balanced armature receivers that require almost zero power to move because they are only moving a tiny amount of air near your eardrum.  IEMs use dual-driver miniature subwoofers and tweeters that are physically larger and heavier. It takes significantly more electrical current to push these drivers back and forth. Hearing aids often use aggressive battery-saving tricks, such as lowering the sampling rate or \"sleeping\" processes when silence is detected.  The processor of an IEM is running wide open 100% of the time. It is constantly digitizing the world at a high sampling rate to ensure zero latency. If it tried to save battery by \"sleeping\" between notes, you would hear a delay (latency), which would make it impossible to play in time. reply",

          "text": "Let’s try some actual numbers. A fancy passive IEM quotes: > Sensitivity: 114 dB-SPL (@ 0.1V) That’s on the high side for an IEM.  Let’s be conservative and say it’s actually 100dB SPL at 1mW (which is on the low side) and that the user has hearing loss and the IEM is actually outputting 90dB continuously (I’m not an expert but this seems high. Certainly I would not set an active IEM anywhere near that loud, even at a concert).  That’s 0.1mW of electrical power to each IEM, for 0.2mW total.  This part could run for days on a small battery pack. A modern amplifier might as well be 100% efficient, although that body pack could easily be some wildly efficient Class A design. Let’s suppose the DSP is processing 96kSPS (might as well minimize latency and the need for a complex antialiasing setup and let’s assume it’s using a duper-high-fidelity FIR filter that’s a whole 100ms long, i.e. 9600 taps, and that the FIR implementation is pure brute force, so there are 9600 times 96k FMAs per second.  That’s about 2 billion FMAs per second for both ears.  (Again, this is a ridiculous way to do this.)  The fancy nonlinear compression stuff will be negligible in comparison. From some quick Googling, you could easily spend a whole watt on the DSP. And there’s where all that battery charge goes :) I bet that someone who really cared about optimizing this could put some software engineering into getting DSP power down below 50mW.  Either use an FFT to optimize the filter or use a much lower complexity filter bank. reply",

          "text": "Thanks! I have hearing aids too and, while I don't have profound hearing loss (severe one side, moderate the other), it's got to the point where I am starting to look at other solutions to supplement them. For those not aware: hearing aids are not like eyeglasses, where you can effectively have your vision restored to 20/20 with the right prescription. They help, but they don't get you up to the level of a person with ordinary hearing. This goes particularly for situations with high background noise, multiple voices, etc.: restaurants, bars, parties and other places where social life tends to happen. Your recommendation has made me think I should finally take the leap on live-caption glasses, which I've been watching for a while now. It sounds like they've finally got to the point where they're effective. A question: how do you find them in conversations with multiple people? Do the glasses help you distinguish speakers by breaking out text from different voices, or is it all just a stream of words? What if there are multiple conversations going on - do the glasses manage to \"focus\" captioning on the one you're closest to, or do other conversations creep in? The captions on google meet have been useful for me as well, although I do wish they were more configurable, e.g. being able to give the captioning model a list of technical phrases, internal company terms, or acronyms that are likely to come up. There also seems to be a gap still between real time transcription, which is good, and after-the-fact transcription, which is excellent. (You can also use an LLM for the latter and prompt it yourself with extra context, although that may not be the best model.) It's been great to see so much progress in this area in the past few years. I am hoping the current (over-)investment in AI at least has the side effect of improving the tech still further. reply",

What if there are multiple conversations going on - do the glasses manage to \"focus\" captioning on the one you're closest to, or do other conversations creep in? It really depends if people are talking at the same time or not. If in a close group (space matters, the mic only goes ~2-3m), one person talking at a time, then they're great. That's the setup I most often have at conferences, so it's been great there. In evenings/parties, it's a bit more chaotic, and the glasses tend to fall off for sure. Regarding distinguishing different speakers etc I haven't needed that, I use the glasses as a helper, they fill in the gaps. So it's \"just a stream of words\", but it has been enough to already help a ton. The directional mic does work quite well, but sometimes you have just 2 conversations happening in front of you and it's not working at all. In other setups (especially professional ones), people usually speak one at a time and it works great. reply",

But considering the kind of hardware they most likely are using, how is the captioning actually happening? I'm really scared of getting hardware that is 100% cloud dependent, as eventually the company gets bought or shut down, and then you end up having to repeat the process of figuring out what to buy next, and sometimes that just one or two years in the future. They are not making it clear how the captioning is happening, but since they don't claim it'll continue working even if the company disappears/shuts down, one can be safe to assume it's a cloud product, meaning it won't actually be a good fit for most people out there with a limited amount of money to spend on things like these. Edit: I realize now this product is not at all for people like me, \"Boost caption accuracy up to 98%\" and \"More accurate translations\" are locked behind a $15/month subscription, kind of disgusting how they hide making the product work as it should behind a subscription. I just want some simple glasses that can caption what people are saying without ripping me off, I guess we're too late into capitalism for that to actually be made for consumer. reply",

If it's associated with an ongoing cost it's perfectly justifiable to charge an ongoing fee, IMO. That said I’d much prefer an option tied to how much you actually use it. reply",

          "text": "I'll tell you what is NOT hot! I have Phonak Audeos paired over bluetooth with my iPhone.  A few years prior, I used to have Oticon, also paired with my iPhone. With the Oticon, if I made a cellphone call, the iPhone would use the default iPhone microphone while the audio would stream to my hearing aids.  It was good that way because in a noisy environment I could hold the iphone right up to my mouth and the other party would be able to hear what I was saying. With the newer Phonaks, I was very disappointed to find that the new hearing aids would only use the microphone input that is built into the hearing aids themselves, and not the iPhone mic input.  I discovered this when I realised that talking directly into iPhone mic did not make it any easier for the other party to hear me. I complained to my Audiologist who explained that yes, the new hearing aids were copying the behaviour of Apple AirPods, which also have the mic input on the earpod itself, and that there was no way at all to configure the Phonaks to use the iPhone mic input instead. Why is this a problem you might ask?  Because my hearing aids are Behind The Ear (BTE) and thus the mic input on the hearing aid is a good 4 inches away from my face and thus my voice cannot possibly sound as clear as when I could speak directly into an iPhone mic. When I next replace my hearing aids, I shall look for aids that do not mimic this crappy AirPods behaviour... reply",

          "text": "An elaboration on how complicated call handling can be with hearing aids (and how I wanted AirPods-like behavior): I assisted someone with purchasing hearing aids a year ago, and we first had a pair of Philips and returned them within a few months because they only worked with iPhone for supporting phone calls with the microphone on the hearing aids themselves, for Android it didnt work. Even the next generation Philips  9050 that supported Auracast didnt support this. We ended up with Phonaks rebranded as Sennheisers. The audio quality during calls may not be as clear as a separate mic (what i believe you refer to as oticon), but from a user experience its nice to not have to fish out your phone to answer a call or wonder why you can hear the other person but they cant hear you. Note that my complaint here is specific to Android support. reply",

It’s a brain thing, my hearing itself is above average for my age (40), so I’m not sure what exactly can be done, but there was an article many years ago about someone (Bose?) working on aids for that issue, no idea what came of it. I guess all modern hearing aids have some focus mode.

          "text": "That sounds awkward. The tech for isolating a speaker at conversational distances exists.  You use half a dozen microphone transducers (minimum; Crappy microphone transducers are cheap and quality is expensive, so just use a bunch of them), and through a combination of phase and intensity they decode relative location, and amplify that phase expectation while suppressing everything that isn't phased like that. Sound is slow, and readily susceptible to real-time triangulation. The math/processing is much easier if the parallaxes are fixed (eg the microphones are arranged in a line array on the top band of a rigid pair of smart glasses), but with a little latency it's not prohibitive for a deformable array to solve for its own relative position as well. reply",

In this context, the signal and noise have similar properties and are coming from the same direction. Directionality helps but can only do so much. Noise reduction can make hearing aids more comfortable to wear but don't necessarily improve comprehension in challenging situations. Progress here is fantastic -- at the same time it helps to have realistic expectations. Putting the mic on the person speaking sidesteps the problem -- it's like the rest of the room isn't there. reply",

I currently have Oticon Opn1’s and have had Oticons since 2017 (and got new ones in 2022) and they are fabulous. I find the sound quality in noisy environments much better than any other aid I’ve had - much better perception of voices in restaurants, for example. I rarely have to fiddle with the volume control and in fact do not even use any other settings than the main program - I find that whatever the core program is doing tends to be basically what I want. I also very much appreciate that they can natively connect to iPhones (this is also essentially the main reason I have an iPhone). This makes phone calls and music and podcasts very easy. (Whereas up until 2017, I used to dread phone calls.) I actually tried Phonaks briefly in 2022 and hated them. Lots of controls to fiddle with (some with oddly unintuitive names), but that meant I was constantly trying to adjust it and was rarely able to just exist in the moment. I found them markedly worse in noisy environments - I basically couldn’t have a conversation in a restaurant. reply",

They are comfortable, have musical audio quality (Widex works with musicians), very low latency (reducing comb filter effect), and in general look and feel very professional. As for technology, they use bluetooth low energy to connect to the smart phone, which works really well, with the caveat that the range is quite low and if it is in the pocket and you are moving around, media sound will often disrupt or desync intermittently. On the plus side, they last well over a day even with media use (WIdex says they last 37 hours without bluetooth use and that checks out). The case provides charge for about a week, and has wireless and usb-c charging. They are quite pricey, but there are several options (110, 220, 330, 440), and the 220 were more than enough for me. The app has several modes, including directional focus mode, and you can define your own. I sometimes use a different mode for listening to concert music, that disables most filters such as volume protection. I am wearing them for 9 months now, and there was no situation (concerts, traveling, work, sports, etc) were they gave me any issues whatsoever. reply",

          "text": "Audiologist and hearing aid user here. It's a great time to be looking for new hearing aids! Speech in noise capabilities have improved massively this generation, and I can personally attest to this. For me, the most important performance metric is speech perception in noisy / challenging listening situations. For you there might be other considerations, so keep that in mind. With that said, my recommendation are the new Phonak Infinio Sphere devices with with their \"Spheric speech in noise\" feature. It's a complete game changer in terms of speech perception in loud noise. Activating this program in a noisy situation feels like turning off the background noise, leaving only (nearby) voices. The caveat is that to achieve this they use a separate, power-hungry processor and compensate by increasing the battery size (making the whole hearing aid bigger than other, similar hearing aids). The upside to this is that if you're _not_ using the spherical program, you'll have really good battery life. I use mine for exactly 16 hours a day and if I'm careful I can make them last almost three full days. The charger is much better than the previous ones; they use magnets to keep the devices in place instead of relying on plastic friction. The Oticon Intent and new Starkey AI aids are also great. You should always try more than one model before you make a decision. Happy to answer any questions! reply",

I ended up returning them and the only MfI hearing aids the audiologist I went to (I was limited by what was in-network by my insurance and while the old insurance covered equally in-network and out, my new insurance covered 0% out of network so I was going to be looking at double the price to go to Costco). I ended up with Resound which are essentially the same as the Jabras. The one thing that I find absolutely essential is using ear molds instead of domes. My cousin hated ear molds and gave up on them, but I definitely prefer them. Incidentally, I would recommend the HA/hearing loss subreddits (r/HearingAids and r/hardofhearing) over HN for this discussion. The HA group can get a little rigid, but I really like the community at HoH. reply",

          "text": "Weird - in an incredibly similar situation and my RICs are overdue an upgrade (Oticon Opn 3).\nI've been keeping an eye on developments for some time, and I've been looking for something ideally CIC, though I do like the RIC Opns.\nHowever, nothing has had the feature set I wanted - bluetooth, auracast, Apple MFI and being CIC. Oticon just announced/released their 'Zeal' product - a non-custom CIC, with seemingly all the bells and whistles, including bluetooth.\nPlanning to try them soon. I have tried a few aids before (Starkey and some older Phonak) and I do really like the Oticon 'sound'. They work for me, but of course YMMV. I think many aid manufacturers (many of them the same company - WDH!) do 60 day trials. Worth a shot. My only dislike is the new fad, particularly of Oticon, of stopping disposable batteries and only going rechargeable.\nDisposable zinc-air cells have great life (I'd get a week on the Opns at least, with a few hours streaming per day). I travel for work a lot, so carrying a couple of tiny 312's in my wallet or keychain was perfect.\nThe Zeal look to have what Oticon think is a 'compact' charger - but it ain't small.\nMy kingdom for a charger the size of the AirPods Pro case... reply",

What I didn’t know though, is that the charger holds three full charges worth of capacity. Meaning it doesn’t need to be plugged in for three nights in a row. Due to my level of loss (80db), I need the custom mold option. This seems to be primarily to reduce feedback. I’m swapping between the custom mold and the standard tip to see which is best for my use case. So far though, I’m impressed. reply",

The big differentiator for me wasn’t the brand, but the quality of the automatic scene-classification and how fast it adapts between quiet → speech → noisy environments. Phonak and Oticon both do this well, but if you haven't tried devices with real-time binaural processing and multi-band directionality, it's worth demoing a pair. The jump in music clarity and spatial cues is noticeable even for moderate loss. Also, don’t underestimate how much the fitting + REM session matters - the same device can feel completely different depending on how thorough the audiologist is. reply",

It's trivial to fake geographic location observed through source IP addresses (or even RTT multilateration) but much harder to fake time zones a user is active within, particularly if monitoring latency of replies. edit: To further clarify, I don't think a contributions calendar would be beneficial to HN either. I've never cared to think about the country a commenter resides in, and don't care about username/real name either unless the commenter is appealing to their own authority (e.g. \"I am the author of this software\"). Even then, the usefulness of an appeal to own authority is often limited to the ability to reverse lookup the user's personal website (which itself is proven to be notable from other sources) for a link back to their HN profile.

Post history for each account is already visible, so if you have an agenda, it sticks out like a sore thumb there. Moderation: Won't meaningfully impact moderation. HN can already see this info and they are the ones that take moderator action. It may hurt moderation/increase moderation costs because people may tend more to report content based on country instead of content. Transparency: Outright influencer content (political or corporate) doesn't make it to the front page enough for it to matter, or if it does, I can't tell. Anti-abuse: Same as moderation. Abuse reports should be processed based on content and not country of origin. Meaningfully improves discussion quality: If a story is about something happening in a particular country, people who look like they are from that country might get asked more or different questions. This puts people from that country on the spot. They may get increased unsolicited communication or thread hijacks. Right now, if someone wants to be on that spot, they can voluntarily identify, either in the profile or in the post. Possibly something useful would be a rule/requirement that claiming to be from a country different than the one you made an account from--seen either in a profile or post--requires verification for further posting, but if you never make such a contrary claim, the verification is not needed. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">We’re hitting a classic distributed systems wall and I’m looking for war stories or \"least worst\" practices.<p>The Context: We maintain a distributed stateful engine (think search/analytics). The architecture is standard: a Control Plane (Coordinator) assigns data segments to Worker Nodes. The workload involves heavy use of mmap and lazy loading for large datasets.<p>The Incident: We had a cascading failure where the Coordinator got stuck in a loop, DDOS-ing a specific node.<p>The Signal: Coordinator sees Node A has significantly fewer rows (logical count) than the cluster average. It flags Node A as \"underutilized.\"<p>The Action: Coordinator attempts to rebalance/load new segments onto Node A.<p>The Reality: Node A is actually sitting at 197GB RAM usage (near OOM). The data on it happens to be extremely wide (fat rows, huge blobs), so its logical row count is low, but physical footprint is massive.<p>The Loop: Node A rejects the load (or times out). The Coordinator ignores the backpressure, sees the low row count again, and retries immediately.<p>The Core Problem: We are trying to write a \"God Equation\" for our load balancer. We started with row_count, which failed. We looked at disk usage, but that doesn't correlate with RAM because of lazy loading.<p>Now we are staring at mmap. Because the OS manages the page cache, the application-level RSS is noisy and doesn't strictly reflect \"required\" memory vs \"reclaimable\" cache.<p>The Question: Attempting to enumerate every resource variable (CPU, IOPS, RSS, Disk, logical count) into a single scoring function feels like an NP-hard trap.<p>How do you handle placement in systems where memory usage is opaque/dynamic?<p>Dumb Coordinator, Smart Nodes: Should we just let the Coordinator blind-fire based on disk space, and rely 100% on the Node to return hard 429 Too Many Requests based on local pressure?<p>Cost Estimation: Do we try to build a synthetic \"cost model\" per segment (e.g., predicted memory footprint) and schedule based on credits, ignoring actual OS metrics?<p>Control Plane Decoupling: Separate storage balancing (disk) from query balancing (mem)?<p>Feels like we are reinventing the wheel. References to papers or similar architecture post-mortems appreciated.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "There's a simple solution: don't use mmap().  There's a reason that databases use O_DIRECT to read into their own in memory cache.  If it was Good Enough for Oracle in the 1990s, it's probably Good Enough for you. mmap() is one of those things that looks like it's an easy solution when you start writing an application, but that's only because you don't know the complexity time bomb of what you're undertaking. The entire point of the various ways of performing asynchronous disk I/O using APIs like io_uring is to manage when and where blocking of tasks for I/O occurs.  When you know where blocking I/O gets done, you can make it part of your main event loop. If you don't know when or where blocking occurs (be it on I/O or mutexes or other such things), you're forced to make up for it by increasing the size of your thread pool.  But larger thread pools come with a penalty: task switches are expensive!  Scheduling is expensive!  AVX 512 registers alone are 2KB of state per task, and if a thread hasn't run for a while, you're probably missing on your L1 and L2 caches.  That's pure overhead baked into the thread pool architecture that you can entirely avoid by using an event driven architecture. All the high performance systems I've worked on use event driven architectures -- from various network protocol implementations (protocols like BGP on JunOS, the HA functionality) to high speed (persistent and non-persistent) messaging (at Solace).  It just makes everything easier when you're able to keep threads hot on locked to a single core.  Bonus: when the system is at maximum load, you remain at pretty much the same number of requests per second rather than degrading as the number of threads ready to run starts increasing and wasting your CPU resources needlessly when you need them most. It's hard to believe that the event queue architecture I first encountered on an Amiga in the late 1980s when I was just a kid is still worth knowing today. reply",

There are insanely dirty hacks that you could do to start controlling the fallout of the page faults (like playing games with userfaultfd), but they're unmaintainable in the long term as they introduce a fragility that results in unexpected complexity at the worst possible times (bugs).  Rewriting / refactoring is not that hard once one understands the pattern, and I've done that quite a few times.  Depending on the language, there may be other options.  Doing an mlock() on the memory being used could help, but then it's absolutely necessary to carefully limit how much memory is pinned by such mappings. Having been a kernel developer for a long time makes it a lot easier to spot what will work well for applications versus what can be considered glass jaws. reply",

It's simple and predictable, although it's not going to get you the best throughput, predictability and simplicity is often better than perfection. If you always send each node 1/Nth of requests, worst case of a node that is broken but looks up is that you're still sending it a share when it should get nothing; if you have some sort of utilization based metric, if it looks underutilized because it's just dropping requests and responding with success but empty, it sucks up all your requests. Alternatively, people have good results with select M nodes by metrics, and then random selection between those.

          "text": "This actually seems like a simple example of memory request vs limit. Request the amount of memory needed to be healthy, you can potentially set the limit higher to account for \"reclaimable cache\". Another way to approach it if you find that there are too many limiting metrics to accurately model things: is you let the workers grab more segments until you determine that they are overloaded. Ideally for this to work though you have some idea that the node is approaching saturation. So for example: keep adding segments as long as the nth percentile response time is under some threshold. The advantage of this approach is you don't necessarily have to know which resource (memory, filehandles, etc) is at capacity. You don't even necessarily have to have deep knowledge of linux memory management. You just have to be able to probe the system to determine if it's healthy. I can even go backwards with a binary split mechanism. You sort of bring up a node that owns [A-H] (8 segments in this case). If that fails bring up 2 nodes that own [A-D],[E-H], if that fails, all the way down to one segment per node. reply",

          "text": "It's not clear whether you're using Kubernetes, but the Kubernetes way of dealing with this problem is to declare a memory reservation (i.e., a request) along with the container specification. The amount of the reservation will be deducted from the host's available memory for scheduling purposes, regardless of whether the container actually consumes the reserved amount. It's also a best practice to configure the memory limit to be identical to the reservation, so if the container exceeds the reserved amount, the kernel will terminate it via the OOM killer. Of course, for this to work, you have to figure out what that reserved amount should be. That is an exercise for the implementer (i.e., you). See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-res... >  Attempting to enumerate every resource variable (CPU, IOPS, RSS, Disk, logical count) into a single scoring function feels like an NP-hard trap. Yeah, don't do that. Figure out what resources your applications need and the declare them, and let the scheduler find the best node based on the requirements you've specified. > We are trying to write a \"God Equation\" for our load balancer. We started with row_count, which failed. We looked at disk usage, but that doesn't correlate with RAM because of lazy loading. A few things come to mind... First, you're talking about a load balancer, but it's not clear that you're trying to balance load! A good metric to use for load balancing is one whose value is proportional to response latency. It smells like you're trying to provision resources based on an optimistic prediction of your working set size. Perhaps you need a more pessimistic prediction. It might also be that you're relying too heavily on the kernel to handle paging, when what you really need is a cache tuned for your application that is scan-resistant, coupled with O_DIRECT for I/O. reply",

My point is really that if transactions are taking minutes to complete, that's likely to be a social/structural problem, not a technical one. With today's technology and all the work in this space, it's not particularly technically difficult to get such times down into the seconds or milliseconds, depending on the constraints. Yes, HFT has gone to extremes to get trade execution times down as low as microseconds. And sure, that involves technical challenges.

Or if they didn't like your last name, your age or your sex. Then all kinds of strange fees. Although if you were a physical location with a high transaction volume, then banks offer better rates than Stripe. Then your actual commerce software. The best quality systems for online sales all work with Stripe, and not with your local bank's offering. So if you want to forego Stripe, that also means you need to use a lower quality system.

          "text": "Previously you had a few choices, go with: 1. PayPal, who wanted to own the customer relationship 2. A payment processor who all had awful APIs and you had to do lots of setup around having a merchant account. Authorize.net I think was one of these. Recurring payments were often a nightmare to get to work. 3. An intermediary processor, who didn't need you to have a merchant account, nochex, Worldpay, sagepay, etc. who again generally all had awful APIs and hard to embed widgets and complicated setup processes. Again, recurring payments a nightmare. Stripe solved all these pain points, and the API was great. It wasn't one pain point they solved, it was many. You controlled the customer relationship, it was easy to embed the stripe widget, it had a great API, you didn't need a merchant account and the setup was quick and easy. Recurring payments were (fairly) easy to set up. Oh, and great documentation! That was another big thing. And then they brought out a little widget you could attach to your phone/tablet to allow easy in-person card payments! It probably seems a bit incomprehensible now, but this was a time when everyone did everything slightly awkwardly. Integrating with any third party was a big job. Documentation was terrible. Formats were all over the place. SOAP, XML, JSON was only just emerging as the defacto standard. For example, the APIs. Great APIs were rare, as far as I remember twilio and I think MailChimp really blazed the way there. Companies like Google were putting out absolute dogshit, complicated APIs, often strict REST with weird header requirements, or strange signing with private keys. If you've never dealt with it, strict REST really, really sucks. reply",

I'll try to articulate my reasons as follows: - In every authentication system (the airports' face scanning ones and others) there's a point at which a yes/no decision must be made: is this person authentic or is not? - This yes/no \"decision module\" must base its determination solely on a series of bits presented to it by the image sensor. - Every series of bits can be spoofed because the decision module can't tell whether the bits originated from a real image sensor or from a very convincing AI or elsewhere. The only exception to this is when the bits include a cryptographic signature, generated using a private key, securely embedded within the image sensor. - The chance of such spoofing is minuscule if the sensor and the decision module coexist within a single piece of hardware that's tamper-proof. The decision module for airport face scanners can't be, given the large number of faces that must be queried. When such a decision module and its image sensor are separated by a network, possibilities for intrusion and spoofing can no longer be ignored. - A helpful analogy is how we decry passwords stored as plain text in backend databases; after the inevitable compromise, these passwords get used to attack other systems. If backend systems store face data as a set of images (as I believe most do), how's that different in principle from storing passwords in a DB, in plain text? - I'll grant that a careful designed system will allay my fears. The backend should store nothing but salted hashes and the image sensors must send only signed images of the subject. - Stepping back, my ultimate concern with face authentication systems is that their technical details are opaque and they're used in situations where recourse is limited at best. reply",

Imagine all the cameras you walked by even getting to the new cameras you seemingly have problems with? If you're at an airport, people have their phones out recording all the time. It's public. I want the CBSA to be recording, databasing, post-analyzing including the ability to feed a photo into their database and know who that is. That's the border. The big question, I'm not sure. Should the data be freedom of information act accessible? I think we side on privacy here; ban the government from sharing the ID information. >EU rules are currently stricter and US rules allow some opt-outs for people that are uncomfortable with it. Here in Canada, no significant rules. You can ride on an international flight fully covered except eyes to see where you're going. We recently increased privacy having everyone ride with a mask.

What Poopalert does is use smartpipes (toilet drains equipped with smart device tech such as employee biomedical health monitoring) - so it uses smart pipes to see if there is an unflushed toilet.  Then are staff will go flush and clean, so the next guy gets the proper clean experience, and we dock the phantom shitter a small premium for the service which goes to our bonus pool.  Anyway, with the smartpipes we can also tell if an employee is unwell or a risk, basically assess their healthy status, and cull the herd so to speak by firing the bottom 10% least healthy workforce. This will lead to an organization of obedient, respectful, team players, all of which are very healthy - and make our custodial duties - or doodies as it were - much easier!! reply",

We are extra careful about new accounts because we find that it helps us to prevent abuse, and in situations where a new account is somewhere in the grey zone of possibly real or fake, we may ask for additional information, or a PayPal payment, like in this situation. \nIf you choose PayPal, the €20 will go on your account in the form of credit and will automatically be used towards your future invoices. If you decide to cancel your account, and there is credit left on your account, we will refund you for that amount. \nFor the passport (or other documents) -- We have very strict data protection laws here in Germany and the EU.

I emailed Hetz two days ago, explained the situation (passport a no-no, friend has PP, but I'm signed up with bank transfer so could I just use that). Hetz replied saying account has now been enabled and I'm good to go. Also excellent. 3. The observations in this reply about passport - if you've been hacked and not noticed yet, all passports passing through your hands are being exfiltrated (assuming attackers cares about them, of course).  You'd only realize how long its being going on for once the breach is detected.  I'm not worried about what you are going to use it for, I trust you - the concern is that security is basically impossible and everyone gets breached sooner or later.  There's nothing you or any organization can say or do to ameliorate this concern.  The basic ground working assumption is : everyone is hacked, if not already, then sooner or later, and it won't be noticed for some time. Given that , how do we behave?  what do we do?  how do we act?  obviously, identity via passports is off the menu. Finally, there's no info during sign about about passport document being held only for a short time; seems potentially useful to have that. reply",

I have noticed this uptick in mentions of Hetzner on the internet via personal stories in past month or two which makes me believe they invested into some guerilla promotion campaign. If you search the internet and go beyond articles older than one year, you will find all the bad stories related to Hetzner and how they treat their customers. Personally, I tried to set up account with them in the past, fully being aware of their reputation, because of one service I wanted to use. But after I registered and gave them my payment card details, all fully legit, they blocked the account and I never had a chance to use them. So my own personal opinion is that they can pound sand and experiences of other people should not be ignored and you should definitely not risk putting your data or your business reputation into their hands. There are MUCH better providers in Europe that. Again, I have no idea why people even give Hetzner a chance nowadays. reply",

It's not the best but I cannot say I had any issues or miss any features. I paid 850€ which was a lot but specs-wise, anything close was well above 1000€. So it was a clear winner. Basically, I would say that don't chase max specs, you will likely use only half of the capabilities anyway. Decide what are your deal-breakers and just find the cheapest match. PS: I went to 32\" from 24\". I was concerned with the size but I think I would be able to use up to 38\". It depends on your desk setup and how far the screen is from your face. I cannot touch my screen with my hand, it's too far. So larger screen works for me. But above 38\", I would definitely have to use my eyes more and maybe even move my head so see the corners, which is a clear indicator of oversized screen. reply",

          "text": "Dual 24\" monitors (decent quality IPS), one uses an HDMI KVM to switch between different/retro systems,  Recently upgraded from VGA to HDMI switchbox, the difference was worth the cost to buy some [X] to HDMI adapters.  Now there's enough inexpensive ones to cover all the bases. The benefit for me is I use the main system to look things up and then switch to the target system and I have the main display as a reference and the other as well, Used to have the side monitor as the KVM one, but find I work better with the switched monitor the one in the center, as a side display I would get sore/tired neck from always looking to the side.  With it center I am more comfortable to concentrate on the task at hand on the other system I have up. reply",

          "text": "I have worn hearing aids since childhood in the '90s.  Moderate sloping to profound loss.  Been through all the tech since the equalized analog era. For a while now, like the last 15 to 20 years, since hearing aids went DSP, I had not been much impressed by each new generation.  At the risk of sounding like a bit of an advertisement, that changed this year. I have the new Oticon Intent.  RIC style aid.  They have some of the best spatial awareness I've experienced.    They're capable of quite a lot of directionality - accelerometer and three microphones in each.   I had to have the intensity of the directionality turned down a bit.  It was startling me when I turned my head and I wasn't hearing things behind me enough.  But that's at the expense of less signal due to more environmental noise. The machine-learning based noise reduction is an improvement over the previous generations, too. They have a music mode.  It drops all the speech remapping and noise reduction and just makes it feel loud.  It's some sort of perceptual algorithm: in my case as I turn up the volume it gets more and more treble, because only at the loudest volumes would I hear those high frequencies.  All while being power limited at 95 dB SPL so I know I'm not blowing my ears.  I used to wear over-the-ear headphones for that but I now prefer the hearing aids.   It's nice to not worry about if it's too loud. reply",

          "text": "Just as a tip, shouting or even just speaking more loudly is rarely necessary if someone has (properly configured) hearing aids.  Just speak clearly.  Ensuring proper enunciation so they can read lips is usually more important.  Hearing aids will make it \"loud enough\" but they won't clean up the information. Does she have primarily high frequency loss?  High frequency loss is the most typical in the elderly and also from damage from noise exposure. Different people have different voices.  I usually find it easier to understand men because I hear the lower frequencies better, especially without my hearing aids but also with them.   And it's always easier to understand people you know well compared to strangers. I find small speakers to be awful.  The high frequencies are distorted and tinny.  Scratchy is a good way to put it.  I have a very hard time understanding anything played through a smartphone or tablet speaker.  The speaker is too small to reproduce the bass frequencies I can hear the best, and so it's just TSSST TSSSSSZZT sounds through my hearing aids. I cannot wear my hearing aids at full volume at the dinner table or while working in the kitchen for this reason.  Metal, plastic and paper are also common offenders.   CLINK.  CLINK.  CRSZZST.  It's almost painful and headache inducing if I'm tired. Unfortunately those high frequencies are what carry speech sounds like sh, t, ch and so on.  Without those it's like the adults talking in the Charlie Brown cartoons.  \"wah-womp-wah-wah-mhuh??\" Hearing aids can do two things for this: one is to take some of that high frequency information and remap it to lower frequencies.  This is part of why they say you won't like wearing your hearing aids when you first get them.  They're systematically distorting what you hear -- but in a way you might eventually learn to interpret. The other is just to make it loud enough that it can be heard.  And as you suggest that may be the limit of the hearing capacity if there's very little at the high frequencies the only way to make something high frequency to be perceived, is to hammer the ear with a 90 or 100 dB level of sound. It's absolutely worth having them adjusted a bit.  Also every manufacturer uses a different algorithm for speech frequency remapping.  Some people have strong preferences by brand as to the hearing aid sound.  (Phonak and Oticon certainly have different \"feels\" in my experience.) Almost all hearing aids allow multiple \"configuration profiles\" where you can switch through them with the app or buttons.  I have four: general, lecture, comfort, music.  Comfort mode just nukes the high end and cranks up the noise reduction.  That's what I use if I'm just reading alone in the living room, or when out at the grocery store, etc. As to large groups, personally I've simply conceded I can't do large groups.  If I try I will feel left out and get depressed over it.  If people want to see me at a family reunion, for example, after I do a brief tour to say hi to everyone, they'll have to join me for a small group chat in the den or whatnot. reply",

The newer tech is definitely worth it but spendy. There are times though when I'm a bit jealous, too!

          "text": "Here's a crazy idea.  I personally prefer the fidelity of an active ambient in-ear monitor (IEM), as used by musicians on stage over the best hearing aids.  Once a year, I do a monthly trial with the latest hearing aid models and IMO the fidelity (especially low-end) and the comfort just is not there compared with the best active ambient IEMs.  The difference between hearing aids and IEMs is blurring, but they are not yet fully interchangeable. Standard IEMs isolate you from the world, which is the opposite of what a hearing aid does. However, a specific category called \"Active Ambient\" IEMs bridges this gap.  These are IEMs with embedded high-fidelity microphones on the outer shell. They pick up the sound of the room (bandmates, crowd, conductor), amplify it, and blend it with your monitor mix.  The accompanying bodypack or app often includes a multi-band EQ and Limiter. You can boost specific frequencies where you have hearing loss (e.g., boosting highs to hear cymbals or speech clearly) and set a volume ceiling to protect your remaining hearing.  I have no ownership/sponsorship in the product, but I personally LOVE the ASI Audio 3DME (powered by Sensaphonics), which is the industry standard for this. [1] It allows you to use an app to shape the ambient sound to your hearing needs. The Pros: It provides hearing protection + monitoring + hearing enhancement in one device. The Cons (Why they aren't daily hearing aids): 1) Form Factor: You are tethered to a belt pack. You likely won't wear a wired bodypack to a grocery store or dinner party. 2) Social Barrier: Wearing full-shell custom IEMs creates a \"do not disturb\" look that discourages conversation in social settings.  This can be more socially alienating than a comparatively inconspicuous hearing aid. 3) Battery Life: IEM systems typically last 6–8 hours, whereas hearing aid batteries can last days or weeks.

          "text": "Power requirements, moving mass and audio sampling and processing. Hearing aids run on tiny voltages (typically ~1.4 Volts). They are designed to amplify speech (a small frequency range) at moderate volumes.  An IEM is designed to handle the massive energy of a live drum kit without distortion. To do this, the internal amplifier needs Headroom. It likely steps up the battery voltage significantly (internally converting to higher voltage rails) to ensure that when a snare drum hits 120dB, the amplifier has enough electrical height to reproduce that spike without clipping. Hearing aids use microscopic balanced armature receivers that require almost zero power to move because they are only moving a tiny amount of air near your eardrum.  IEMs use dual-driver miniature subwoofers and tweeters that are physically larger and heavier. It takes significantly more electrical current to push these drivers back and forth. Hearing aids often use aggressive battery-saving tricks, such as lowering the sampling rate or \"sleeping\" processes when silence is detected.  The processor of an IEM is running wide open 100% of the time. It is constantly digitizing the world at a high sampling rate to ensure zero latency. If it tried to save battery by \"sleeping\" between notes, you would hear a delay (latency), which would make it impossible to play in time. reply",

Let’s be conservative and say it’s actually 100dB SPL at 1mW (which is on the low side) and that the user has hearing loss and the IEM is actually outputting 90dB continuously (I’m not an expert but this seems high. Certainly I would not set an active IEM anywhere near that loud, even at a concert).  That’s 0.1mW of electrical power to each IEM, for 0.2mW total.  This part could run for days on a small battery pack. A modern amplifier might as well be 100% efficient, although that body pack could easily be some wildly efficient Class A design. Let’s suppose the DSP is processing 96kSPS (might as well minimize latency and the need for a complex antialiasing setup and let’s assume it’s using a duper-high-fidelity FIR filter that’s a whole 100ms long, i.e. 9600 taps, and that the FIR implementation is pure brute force, so there are 9600 times 96k FMAs per second.  That’s about 2 billion FMAs per second for both ears.  (Again, this is a ridiculous way to do this.)  The fancy nonlinear compression stuff will be negligible in comparison. From some quick Googling, you could easily spend a whole watt on the DSP. And there’s where all that battery charge goes :) I bet that someone who really cared about optimizing this could put some software engineering into getting DSP power down below 50mW.  Either use an FFT to optimize the filter or use a much lower complexity filter bank. reply",

The 3DME uses small MEMS microphones embedded in the faceplate of the earphone and has no physical windscreen or noise suppression like digital hearing aids and consumer buds which use aggressive software algorithms to detect wind and instantly cut the low frequencies to stop the rumble. As a workaround, some artists performing outside wear a thin, acoustically transparent beanie or headband over the ears effectively acting as a pop-filter/windscreen. This breaks the wind before it hits the mic while still letting mid-to-high frequency sound (speech/music) pass through.  Not exactly a hearing aid alternative. reply",

          "text": "Thanks! I have hearing aids too and, while I don't have profound hearing loss (severe one side, moderate the other), it's got to the point where I am starting to look at other solutions to supplement them. For those not aware: hearing aids are not like eyeglasses, where you can effectively have your vision restored to 20/20 with the right prescription. They help, but they don't get you up to the level of a person with ordinary hearing. This goes particularly for situations with high background noise, multiple voices, etc.: restaurants, bars, parties and other places where social life tends to happen. Your recommendation has made me think I should finally take the leap on live-caption glasses, which I've been watching for a while now. It sounds like they've finally got to the point where they're effective. A question: how do you find them in conversations with multiple people? Do the glasses help you distinguish speakers by breaking out text from different voices, or is it all just a stream of words? What if there are multiple conversations going on - do the glasses manage to \"focus\" captioning on the one you're closest to, or do other conversations creep in? The captions on google meet have been useful for me as well, although I do wish they were more configurable, e.g. being able to give the captioning model a list of technical phrases, internal company terms, or acronyms that are likely to come up. There also seems to be a gap still between real time transcription, which is good, and after-the-fact transcription, which is excellent. (You can also use an LLM for the latter and prompt it yourself with extra context, although that may not be the best model.) It's been great to see so much progress in this area in the past few years. I am hoping the current (over-)investment in AI at least has the side effect of improving the tech still further. reply",

What if there are multiple conversations going on - do the glasses manage to \"focus\" captioning on the one you're closest to, or do other conversations creep in? It really depends if people are talking at the same time or not. If in a close group (space matters, the mic only goes ~2-3m), one person talking at a time, then they're great. That's the setup I most often have at conferences, so it's been great there. In evenings/parties, it's a bit more chaotic, and the glasses tend to fall off for sure. Regarding distinguishing different speakers etc I haven't needed that, I use the glasses as a helper, they fill in the gaps. So it's \"just a stream of words\", but it has been enough to already help a ton. The directional mic does work quite well, but sometimes you have just 2 conversations happening in front of you and it's not working at all. In other setups (especially professional ones), people usually speak one at a time and it works great. reply",

          "text": "> Specifically, the ones from [Captify][1]. Looks and seems great, always felt like a no-brainer use case for the smart glasses. But considering the kind of hardware they most likely are using, how is the captioning actually happening? I'm really scared of getting hardware that is 100% cloud dependent, as eventually the company gets bought or shut down, and then you end up having to repeat the process of figuring out what to buy next, and sometimes that just one or two years in the future. They are not making it clear how the captioning is happening, but since they don't claim it'll continue working even if the company disappears/shuts down, one can be safe to assume it's a cloud product, meaning it won't actually be a good fit for most people out there with a limited amount of money to spend on things like these. Edit: I realize now this product is not at all for people like me, \"Boost caption accuracy up to 98%\" and \"More accurate translations\" are locked behind a $15/month subscription, kind of disgusting how they hide making the product work as it should behind a subscription. I just want some simple glasses that can caption what people are saying without ripping me off, I guess we're too late into capitalism for that to actually be made for consumer. reply",

          "text": "I'll tell you what is NOT hot! I have Phonak Audeos paired over bluetooth with my iPhone.  A few years prior, I used to have Oticon, also paired with my iPhone. With the Oticon, if I made a cellphone call, the iPhone would use the default iPhone microphone while the audio would stream to my hearing aids.  It was good that way because in a noisy environment I could hold the iphone right up to my mouth and the other party would be able to hear what I was saying. With the newer Phonaks, I was very disappointed to find that the new hearing aids would only use the microphone input that is built into the hearing aids themselves, and not the iPhone mic input.  I discovered this when I realised that talking directly into iPhone mic did not make it any easier for the other party to hear me. I complained to my Audiologist who explained that yes, the new hearing aids were copying the behaviour of Apple AirPods, which also have the mic input on the earpod itself, and that there was no way at all to configure the Phonaks to use the iPhone mic input instead. Why is this a problem you might ask?  Because my hearing aids are Behind The Ear (BTE) and thus the mic input on the hearing aid is a good 4 inches away from my face and thus my voice cannot possibly sound as clear as when I could speak directly into an iPhone mic. When I next replace my hearing aids, I shall look for aids that do not mimic this crappy AirPods behaviour... reply",

Even the next generation Philips  9050 that supported Auracast didnt support this. We ended up with Phonaks rebranded as Sennheisers. The audio quality during calls may not be as clear as a separate mic (what i believe you refer to as oticon), but from a user experience its nice to not have to fish out your phone to answer a call or wonder why you can hear the other person but they cant hear you.

You use half a dozen microphone transducers (minimum; Crappy microphone transducers are cheap and quality is expensive, so just use a bunch of them), and through a combination of phase and intensity they decode relative location, and amplify that phase expectation while suppressing everything that isn't phased like that. Sound is slow, and readily susceptible to real-time triangulation. The math/processing is much easier if the parallaxes are fixed (eg the microphones are arranged in a line array on the top band of a rigid pair of smart glasses), but with a little latency it's not prohibitive for a deformable array to solve for its own relative position as well. reply",

In this context, the signal and noise have similar properties and are coming from the same direction. Directionality helps but can only do so much. Noise reduction can make hearing aids more comfortable to wear but don't necessarily improve comprehension in challenging situations.

I find the sound quality in noisy environments much better than any other aid I’ve had - much better perception of voices in restaurants, for example. I rarely have to fiddle with the volume control and in fact do not even use any other settings than the main program - I find that whatever the core program is doing tends to be basically what I want. I also very much appreciate that they can natively connect to iPhones (this is also essentially the main reason I have an iPhone). This makes phone calls and music and podcasts very easy. (Whereas up until 2017, I used to dread phone calls.) I actually tried Phonaks briefly in 2022 and hated them. Lots of controls to fiddle with (some with oddly unintuitive names), but that meant I was constantly trying to adjust it and was rarely able to just exist in the moment. I found them markedly worse in noisy environments - I basically couldn’t have a conversation in a restaurant. reply",

They are comfortable, have musical audio quality (Widex works with musicians), very low latency (reducing comb filter effect), and in general look and feel very professional. As for technology, they use bluetooth low energy to connect to the smart phone, which works really well, with the caveat that the range is quite low and if it is in the pocket and you are moving around, media sound will often disrupt or desync intermittently. On the plus side, they last well over a day even with media use (WIdex says they last 37 hours without bluetooth use and that checks out). The case provides charge for about a week, and has wireless and usb-c charging. They are quite pricey, but there are several options (110, 220, 330, 440), and the 220 were more than enough for me. The app has several modes, including directional focus mode, and you can define your own. I sometimes use a different mode for listening to concert music, that disables most filters such as volume protection. I am wearing them for 9 months now, and there was no situation (concerts, traveling, work, sports, etc) were they gave me any issues whatsoever. reply",

          "text": "Audiologist and hearing aid user here. It's a great time to be looking for new hearing aids! Speech in noise capabilities have improved massively this generation, and I can personally attest to this. For me, the most important performance metric is speech perception in noisy / challenging listening situations. For you there might be other considerations, so keep that in mind. With that said, my recommendation are the new Phonak Infinio Sphere devices with with their \"Spheric speech in noise\" feature. It's a complete game changer in terms of speech perception in loud noise. Activating this program in a noisy situation feels like turning off the background noise, leaving only (nearby) voices. The caveat is that to achieve this they use a separate, power-hungry processor and compensate by increasing the battery size (making the whole hearing aid bigger than other, similar hearing aids). The upside to this is that if you're _not_ using the spherical program, you'll have really good battery life. I use mine for exactly 16 hours a day and if I'm careful I can make them last almost three full days. The charger is much better than the previous ones; they use magnets to keep the devices in place instead of relying on plastic friction. The Oticon Intent and new Starkey AI aids are also great. You should always try more than one model before you make a decision. Happy to answer any questions! reply",

I tried Phonaks and found that the use of Bluetooth to connect to my iPhone was painfully flakey (there were certain locations in my neighborhood that every time I walked in front of a particular house, I would lose audio). I ended up returning them and the only MfI hearing aids the audiologist I went to (I was limited by what was in-network by my insurance and while the old insurance covered equally in-network and out, my new insurance covered 0% out of network so I was going to be looking at double the price to go to Costco). I ended up with Resound which are essentially the same as the Jabras. The one thing that I find absolutely essential is using ear molds instead of domes. My cousin hated ear molds and gave up on them, but I definitely prefer them. Incidentally, I would recommend the HA/hearing loss subreddits (r/HearingAids and r/hardofhearing) over HN for this discussion. The HA group can get a little rigid, but I really like the community at HoH. reply",

Whenever I’d get a call or some audio thing was going to happen, my HA mics would go silent and second or so later the audio would come in.

Oticon just announced/released their 'Zeal' product - a non-custom CIC, with seemingly all the bells and whistles, including bluetooth.\nPlanning to try them soon. I have tried a few aids before (Starkey and some older Phonak) and I do really like the Oticon 'sound'. They work for me, but of course YMMV. I think many aid manufacturers (many of them the same company - WDH!) do 60 day trials. Worth a shot. My only dislike is the new fad, particularly of Oticon, of stopping disposable batteries and only going rechargeable.\nDisposable zinc-air cells have great life (I'd get a week on the Opns at least, with a few hours streaming per day). I travel for work a lot, so carrying a couple of tiny 312's in my wallet or keychain was perfect.\nThe Zeal look to have what Oticon think is a 'compact' charger - but it ain't small.\nMy kingdom for a charger the size of the AirPods Pro case... reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">We’re hitting a classic distributed systems wall and I’m looking for war stories or \"least worst\" practices.<p>The Context: We maintain a distributed stateful engine (think search/analytics). The architecture is standard: a Control Plane (Coordinator) assigns data segments to Worker Nodes. The workload involves heavy use of mmap and lazy loading for large datasets.<p>The Incident: We had a cascading failure where the Coordinator got stuck in a loop, DDOS-ing a specific node.<p>The Signal: Coordinator sees Node A has significantly fewer rows (logical count) than the cluster average. It flags Node A as \"underutilized.\"<p>The Action: Coordinator attempts to rebalance/load new segments onto Node A.<p>The Reality: Node A is actually sitting at 197GB RAM usage (near OOM). The data on it happens to be extremely wide (fat rows, huge blobs), so its logical row count is low, but physical footprint is massive.<p>The Loop: Node A rejects the load (or times out). The Coordinator ignores the backpressure, sees the low row count again, and retries immediately.<p>The Core Problem: We are trying to write a \"God Equation\" for our load balancer. We started with row_count, which failed. We looked at disk usage, but that doesn't correlate with RAM because of lazy loading.<p>Now we are staring at mmap. Because the OS manages the page cache, the application-level RSS is noisy and doesn't strictly reflect \"required\" memory vs \"reclaimable\" cache.<p>The Question: Attempting to enumerate every resource variable (CPU, IOPS, RSS, Disk, logical count) into a single scoring function feels like an NP-hard trap.<p>How do you handle placement in systems where memory usage is opaque/dynamic?<p>Dumb Coordinator, Smart Nodes: Should we just let the Coordinator blind-fire based on disk space, and rely 100% on the Node to return hard 429 Too Many Requests based on local pressure?<p>Cost Estimation: Do we try to build a synthetic \"cost model\" per segment (e.g., predicted memory footprint) and schedule based on credits, ignoring actual OS metrics?<p>Control Plane Decoupling: Separate storage balancing (disk) from query balancing (mem)?<p>Feels like we are reinventing the wheel. References to papers or similar architecture post-mortems appreciated.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "There's a simple solution: don't use mmap().  There's a reason that databases use O_DIRECT to read into their own in memory cache.  If it was Good Enough for Oracle in the 1990s, it's probably Good Enough for you. mmap() is one of those things that looks like it's an easy solution when you start writing an application, but that's only because you don't know the complexity time bomb of what you're undertaking. The entire point of the various ways of performing asynchronous disk I/O using APIs like io_uring is to manage when and where blocking of tasks for I/O occurs.  When you know where blocking I/O gets done, you can make it part of your main event loop. If you don't know when or where blocking occurs (be it on I/O or mutexes or other such things), you're forced to make up for it by increasing the size of your thread pool.  But larger thread pools come with a penalty: task switches are expensive!  Scheduling is expensive!  AVX 512 registers alone are 2KB of state per task, and if a thread hasn't run for a while, you're probably missing on your L1 and L2 caches.  That's pure overhead baked into the thread pool architecture that you can entirely avoid by using an event driven architecture. All the high performance systems I've worked on use event driven architectures -- from various network protocol implementations (protocols like BGP on JunOS, the HA functionality) to high speed (persistent and non-persistent) messaging (at Solace).  It just makes everything easier when you're able to keep threads hot on locked to a single core.  Bonus: when the system is at maximum load, you remain at pretty much the same number of requests per second rather than degrading as the number of threads ready to run starts increasing and wasting your CPU resources needlessly when you need them most. It's hard to believe that the event queue architecture I first encountered on an Amiga in the late 1980s when I was just a kid is still worth knowing today. reply",

There are insanely dirty hacks that you could do to start controlling the fallout of the page faults (like playing games with userfaultfd), but they're unmaintainable in the long term as they introduce a fragility that results in unexpected complexity at the worst possible times (bugs).  Rewriting / refactoring is not that hard once one understands the pattern, and I've done that quite a few times.  Depending on the language, there may be other options.  Doing an mlock() on the memory being used could help, but then it's absolutely necessary to carefully limit how much memory is pinned by such mappings. Having been a kernel developer for a long time makes it a lot easier to spot what will work well for applications versus what can be considered glass jaws. reply",

          "text": "This actually seems like a simple example of memory request vs limit. Request the amount of memory needed to be healthy, you can potentially set the limit higher to account for \"reclaimable cache\". Another way to approach it if you find that there are too many limiting metrics to accurately model things: is you let the workers grab more segments until you determine that they are overloaded. Ideally for this to work though you have some idea that the node is approaching saturation. So for example: keep adding segments as long as the nth percentile response time is under some threshold. The advantage of this approach is you don't necessarily have to know which resource (memory, filehandles, etc) is at capacity. You don't even necessarily have to have deep knowledge of linux memory management. You just have to be able to probe the system to determine if it's healthy. I can even go backwards with a binary split mechanism. You sort of bring up a node that owns [A-H] (8 segments in this case). If that fails bring up 2 nodes that own [A-D],[E-H], if that fails, all the way down to one segment per node. reply",

          "text": "It's not clear whether you're using Kubernetes, but the Kubernetes way of dealing with this problem is to declare a memory reservation (i.e., a request) along with the container specification. The amount of the reservation will be deducted from the host's available memory for scheduling purposes, regardless of whether the container actually consumes the reserved amount. It's also a best practice to configure the memory limit to be identical to the reservation, so if the container exceeds the reserved amount, the kernel will terminate it via the OOM killer. Of course, for this to work, you have to figure out what that reserved amount should be. That is an exercise for the implementer (i.e., you). See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-res... >  Attempting to enumerate every resource variable (CPU, IOPS, RSS, Disk, logical count) into a single scoring function feels like an NP-hard trap. Yeah, don't do that. Figure out what resources your applications need and the declare them, and let the scheduler find the best node based on the requirements you've specified. > We are trying to write a \"God Equation\" for our load balancer. We started with row_count, which failed. We looked at disk usage, but that doesn't correlate with RAM because of lazy loading. A few things come to mind... First, you're talking about a load balancer, but it's not clear that you're trying to balance load! A good metric to use for load balancing is one whose value is proportional to response latency. It smells like you're trying to provision resources based on an optimistic prediction of your working set size. Perhaps you need a more pessimistic prediction. It might also be that you're relying too heavily on the kernel to handle paging, when what you really need is a cache tuned for your application that is scan-resistant, coupled with O_DIRECT for I/O. reply",

My point is really that if transactions are taking minutes to complete, that's likely to be a social/structural problem, not a technical one. With today's technology and all the work in this space, it's not particularly technically difficult to get such times down into the seconds or milliseconds, depending on the constraints. Yes, HFT has gone to extremes to get trade execution times down as low as microseconds. And sure, that involves technical challenges.

It's trivial to fake geographic location observed through source IP addresses (or even RTT multilateration) but much harder to fake time zones a user is active within, particularly if monitoring latency of replies. edit: To further clarify, I don't think a contributions calendar would be beneficial to HN either. I've never cared to think about the country a commenter resides in, and don't care about username/real name either unless the commenter is appealing to their own authority (e.g. \"I am the author of this software\"). Even then, the usefulness of an appeal to own authority is often limited to the ability to reverse lookup the user's personal website (which itself is proven to be notable from other sources) for a link back to their HN profile.

Seemingly, it's the same kind of misalignment that makes people loudly complain when political threads get flagged and killed. This site is specifically a salon where a bunch of pseudonymous \"too smart\" nerds opine about topics that stimulate their curiosity, following guidelines on best-intent and good-faith that are essentially debate rules. Sometimes, amidst those discussions, you'll witness seemingly personal anecdotes or seemingly insider insights, which you should always be taking as a grain of salt, used only to drive (or repel) your own curiosity and desire for more discussion and debate. It's not a great place for earnest politics, activism, or anything so serious and existential. And because it doesn't aim to be, it doesn't beg for disclosures like location. As long as you can \"talk the talk\" here, and follow the guidelines, you're welcome to participate in the discussion how you'd like, without being measured by your person, its history, or its geography. Its great to have a place like that online. reply",

Post history for each account is already visible, so if you have an agenda, it sticks out like a sore thumb there. Moderation: Won't meaningfully impact moderation. HN can already see this info and they are the ones that take moderator action. It may hurt moderation/increase moderation costs because people may tend more to report content based on country instead of content. Transparency: Outright influencer content (political or corporate) doesn't make it to the front page enough for it to matter, or if it does, I can't tell. Anti-abuse: Same as moderation. Abuse reports should be processed based on content and not country of origin. Meaningfully improves discussion quality: If a story is about something happening in a particular country, people who look like they are from that country might get asked more or different questions. This puts people from that country on the spot. They may get increased unsolicited communication or thread hijacks. Right now, if someone wants to be on that spot, they can voluntarily identify, either in the profile or in the post. Possibly something useful would be a rule/requirement that claiming to be from a country different than the one you made an account from--seen either in a profile or post--requires verification for further posting, but if you never make such a contrary claim, the verification is not needed. reply",

          "text": "\"Disclose\" is kinda ambiguous here. One of the hindrances to getting a patent is prior art. Meaning that the thing you're trying yo patent already exists. After a patent is issued lots of people typically say \"but that's obvious\". Ok, so let's capture the obvious before someone patents it. Equally, I might be doing something which is patentable, but I have no interest in patenting it. By registering it somewhere I make it easy for the patent office to search, thus turning down a patent application. Thus preventing me being sued by some new patent holder. But to answer the question, no I wouldn't use a service like this. Partly because I wouldn't spend the money and partly because (in isolation) the service doesn't work. Unless the patent office is involved and actively using it, bad patents still get granted. Yes, it might add some weight to a court case where I'm being sued, but honestly if I get there I've already lost. And my code backups show the same thing anyway. Plus, which of the thousands of things I am doing, should I register? Am I supposed to trawl through my code deciding on each line if it's novel? If I do all this work I might as well just get a patent. That can at least be used in cross-licencing agreements. Yes, software patents are a blight, but I'm not sure this is really a solution. reply",

What Poopalert does is use smartpipes (toilet drains equipped with smart device tech such as employee biomedical health monitoring) - so it uses smart pipes to see if there is an unflushed toilet.  Then are staff will go flush and clean, so the next guy gets the proper clean experience, and we dock the phantom shitter a small premium for the service which goes to our bonus pool.  Anyway, with the smartpipes we can also tell if an employee is unwell or a risk, basically assess their healthy status, and cull the herd so to speak by firing the bottom 10% least healthy workforce. This will lead to an organization of obedient, respectful, team players, all of which are very healthy - and make our custodial duties - or doodies as it were - much easier!! reply",

A payment processor who all had awful APIs and you had to do lots of setup around having a merchant account. Authorize.net I think was one of these. Recurring payments were often a nightmare to get to work. 3. An intermediary processor, who didn't need you to have a merchant account, nochex, Worldpay, sagepay, etc. who again generally all had awful APIs and hard to embed widgets and complicated setup processes. Again, recurring payments a nightmare. Stripe solved all these pain points, and the API was great. It wasn't one pain point they solved, it was many. You controlled the customer relationship, it was easy to embed the stripe widget, it had a great API, you didn't need a merchant account and the setup was quick and easy. Recurring payments were (fairly) easy to set up. Oh, and great documentation! That was another big thing. And then they brought out a little widget you could attach to your phone/tablet to allow easy in-person card payments! It probably seems a bit incomprehensible now, but this was a time when everyone did everything slightly awkwardly. Integrating with any third party was a big job. Documentation was terrible. Formats were all over the place. SOAP, XML, JSON was only just emerging as the defacto standard. For example, the APIs. Great APIs were rare, as far as I remember twilio and I think MailChimp really blazed the way there. Companies like Google were putting out absolute dogshit, complicated APIs, often strict REST with weird header requirements, or strange signing with private keys. If you've never dealt with it, strict REST really, really sucks. reply",

Imagine all the cameras you walked by even getting to the new cameras you seemingly have problems with? If you're at an airport, people have their phones out recording all the time. It's public. I want the CBSA to be recording, databasing, post-analyzing including the ability to feed a photo into their database and know who that is. That's the border. The big question, I'm not sure. Should the data be freedom of information act accessible? I think we side on privacy here; ban the government from sharing the ID information. >EU rules are currently stricter and US rules allow some opt-outs for people that are uncomfortable with it. Here in Canada, no significant rules. You can ride on an international flight fully covered except eyes to see where you're going. We recently increased privacy having everyone ride with a mask. You can opt out of the radiation/xray scans for health and religious reasons. reply",

          "text": "Given how many pictures governments and corporations collect from public places, the GP's concern seems moot. I'll try to articulate my reasons as follows: - In every authentication system (the airports' face scanning ones and others) there's a point at which a yes/no decision must be made: is this person authentic or is not? - This yes/no \"decision module\" must base its determination solely on a series of bits presented to it by the image sensor. - Every series of bits can be spoofed because the decision module can't tell whether the bits originated from a real image sensor or from a very convincing AI or elsewhere. The only exception to this is when the bits include a cryptographic signature, generated using a private key, securely embedded within the image sensor. - The chance of such spoofing is minuscule if the sensor and the decision module coexist within a single piece of hardware that's tamper-proof. The decision module for airport face scanners can't be, given the large number of faces that must be queried. When such a decision module and its image sensor are separated by a network, possibilities for intrusion and spoofing can no longer be ignored. - A helpful analogy is how we decry passwords stored as plain text in backend databases; after the inevitable compromise, these passwords get used to attack other systems. If backend systems store face data as a set of images (as I believe most do), how's that different in principle from storing passwords in a DB, in plain text? - I'll grant that a careful designed system will allay my fears. The backend should store nothing but salted hashes and the image sensors must send only signed images of the subject. - Stepping back, my ultimate concern with face authentication systems is that their technical details are opaque and they're used in situations where recourse is limited at best. reply",

Microsoft Azure was also very confusing and I don't think I was even able to use it because I had no clue how. Google had the best dashboard and I never had issue with anything, despite it lacking in offering(back then). In the end, I ditched all cloud providers and went to standard VPS providers because cloud is good to get you going when you might need elasticity for unknown growth. Buts after that, it makes no financial sense and is a huge vendor lock-in trap. PS and no, companies that provide VPS hosting are not \"cloud\". reply",

You'd have to be more specific about what you actually want to do before someone could give you a more informed take than that. I've built out at least one nontrivial thing on all of the major names and many of the lesser known ones by this point and I'm likely to continue to just because infra is fun :) From a position of zero knowledge otherwise, I would probably default to Azure just because I have a lot of faith in it being able to drive enterprise workloads while staying compliant with whatever regulations exist under the sun. If I find out that more or less we don't care about that I then pass the torch to AWS because they tend to have a slight pride advantage. If I find out yet more information, like e.g. the client prefers running everything on VMs they themselves control, I might look into Hetzner, etc. Cloudflare for very specific egress or serverless needs... But you can see it really all depends on the project, and if you don't know any better you might as well just pick one of the big three at random and go for it. reply",

          "text": "I have worn hearing aids since childhood in the '90s.  Moderate sloping to profound loss.  Been through all the tech since the equalized analog era. For a while now, like the last 15 to 20 years, since hearing aids went DSP, I had not been much impressed by each new generation.  At the risk of sounding like a bit of an advertisement, that changed this year. I have the new Oticon Intent.  RIC style aid.  They have some of the best spatial awareness I've experienced.    They're capable of quite a lot of directionality - accelerometer and three microphones in each.   I had to have the intensity of the directionality turned down a bit.  It was startling me when I turned my head and I wasn't hearing things behind me enough.  But that's at the expense of less signal due to more environmental noise. The machine-learning based noise reduction is an improvement over the previous generations, too. They have a music mode.  It drops all the speech remapping and noise reduction and just makes it feel loud.  It's some sort of perceptual algorithm: in my case as I turn up the volume it gets more and more treble, because only at the loudest volumes would I hear those high frequencies.  All while being power limited at 95 dB SPL so I know I'm not blowing my ears.  I used to wear over-the-ear headphones for that but I now prefer the hearing aids.   It's nice to not worry about if it's too loud. reply",

          "text": "Just as a tip, shouting or even just speaking more loudly is rarely necessary if someone has (properly configured) hearing aids.  Just speak clearly.  Ensuring proper enunciation so they can read lips is usually more important.  Hearing aids will make it \"loud enough\" but they won't clean up the information. Does she have primarily high frequency loss?  High frequency loss is the most typical in the elderly and also from damage from noise exposure. Different people have different voices.  I usually find it easier to understand men because I hear the lower frequencies better, especially without my hearing aids but also with them.   And it's always easier to understand people you know well compared to strangers. I find small speakers to be awful.  The high frequencies are distorted and tinny.  Scratchy is a good way to put it.  I have a very hard time understanding anything played through a smartphone or tablet speaker.  The speaker is too small to reproduce the bass frequencies I can hear the best, and so it's just TSSST TSSSSSZZT sounds through my hearing aids. I cannot wear my hearing aids at full volume at the dinner table or while working in the kitchen for this reason.  Metal, plastic and paper are also common offenders.   CLINK.  CLINK.  CRSZZST.  It's almost painful and headache inducing if I'm tired. Unfortunately those high frequencies are what carry speech sounds like sh, t, ch and so on.  Without those it's like the adults talking in the Charlie Brown cartoons.  \"wah-womp-wah-wah-mhuh??\" Hearing aids can do two things for this: one is to take some of that high frequency information and remap it to lower frequencies.  This is part of why they say you won't like wearing your hearing aids when you first get them.  They're systematically distorting what you hear -- but in a way you might eventually learn to interpret. The other is just to make it loud enough that it can be heard.  And as you suggest that may be the limit of the hearing capacity if there's very little at the high frequencies the only way to make something high frequency to be perceived, is to hammer the ear with a 90 or 100 dB level of sound. It's absolutely worth having them adjusted a bit.  Also every manufacturer uses a different algorithm for speech frequency remapping.  Some people have strong preferences by brand as to the hearing aid sound.  (Phonak and Oticon certainly have different \"feels\" in my experience.) Almost all hearing aids allow multiple \"configuration profiles\" where you can switch through them with the app or buttons.  I have four: general, lecture, comfort, music.  Comfort mode just nukes the high end and cranks up the noise reduction.  That's what I use if I'm just reading alone in the living room, or when out at the grocery store, etc. As to large groups, personally I've simply conceded I can't do large groups.  If I try I will feel left out and get depressed over it.  If people want to see me at a family reunion, for example, after I do a brief tour to say hi to everyone, they'll have to join me for a small group chat in the den or whatnot. reply",

But tech progressed and we started noticing that he was having trouble hearing \"s\" sounds. I researched and got him the Oticon Real and it's been amazing and his speech dramatically improved with the new tech. There have been a lot fewer problems with wind noise and he can talk and pay attention in loud environments like school or a restaurant. His grades shot up. The newer tech is definitely worth it but spendy. There are times though when I'm a bit jealous, too!

          "text": "Here's a crazy idea.  I personally prefer the fidelity of an active ambient in-ear monitor (IEM), as used by musicians on stage over the best hearing aids.  Once a year, I do a monthly trial with the latest hearing aid models and IMO the fidelity (especially low-end) and the comfort just is not there compared with the best active ambient IEMs.  The difference between hearing aids and IEMs is blurring, but they are not yet fully interchangeable. Standard IEMs isolate you from the world, which is the opposite of what a hearing aid does. However, a specific category called \"Active Ambient\" IEMs bridges this gap.  These are IEMs with embedded high-fidelity microphones on the outer shell. They pick up the sound of the room (bandmates, crowd, conductor), amplify it, and blend it with your monitor mix.  The accompanying bodypack or app often includes a multi-band EQ and Limiter. You can boost specific frequencies where you have hearing loss (e.g., boosting highs to hear cymbals or speech clearly) and set a volume ceiling to protect your remaining hearing.  I have no ownership/sponsorship in the product, but I personally LOVE the ASI Audio 3DME (powered by Sensaphonics), which is the industry standard for this. [1] It allows you to use an app to shape the ambient sound to your hearing needs. The Pros: It provides hearing protection + monitoring + hearing enhancement in one device. The Cons (Why they aren't daily hearing aids): 1) Form Factor: You are tethered to a belt pack. You likely won't wear a wired bodypack to a grocery store or dinner party. 2) Social Barrier: Wearing full-shell custom IEMs creates a \"do not disturb\" look that discourages conversation in social settings.  This can be more socially alienating than a comparatively inconspicuous hearing aid. 3) Battery Life: IEM systems typically last 6–8 hours, whereas hearing aid batteries can last days or weeks.

          "text": "Power requirements, moving mass and audio sampling and processing. Hearing aids run on tiny voltages (typically ~1.4 Volts). They are designed to amplify speech (a small frequency range) at moderate volumes.  An IEM is designed to handle the massive energy of a live drum kit without distortion. To do this, the internal amplifier needs Headroom. It likely steps up the battery voltage significantly (internally converting to higher voltage rails) to ensure that when a snare drum hits 120dB, the amplifier has enough electrical height to reproduce that spike without clipping. Hearing aids use microscopic balanced armature receivers that require almost zero power to move because they are only moving a tiny amount of air near your eardrum.  IEMs use dual-driver miniature subwoofers and tweeters that are physically larger and heavier. It takes significantly more electrical current to push these drivers back and forth. Hearing aids often use aggressive battery-saving tricks, such as lowering the sampling rate or \"sleeping\" processes when silence is detected.  The processor of an IEM is running wide open 100% of the time. It is constantly digitizing the world at a high sampling rate to ensure zero latency. If it tried to save battery by \"sleeping\" between notes, you would hear a delay (latency), which would make it impossible to play in time. reply",

          "text": "Let’s try some actual numbers. A fancy passive IEM quotes: > Sensitivity: 114 dB-SPL (@ 0.1V) That’s on the high side for an IEM.  Let’s be conservative and say it’s actually 100dB SPL at 1mW (which is on the low side) and that the user has hearing loss and the IEM is actually outputting 90dB continuously (I’m not an expert but this seems high. Certainly I would not set an active IEM anywhere near that loud, even at a concert).  That’s 0.1mW of electrical power to each IEM, for 0.2mW total.  This part could run for days on a small battery pack. A modern amplifier might as well be 100% efficient, although that body pack could easily be some wildly efficient Class A design. Let’s suppose the DSP is processing 96kSPS (might as well minimize latency and the need for a complex antialiasing setup and let’s assume it’s using a duper-high-fidelity FIR filter that’s a whole 100ms long, i.e. 9600 taps, and that the FIR implementation is pure brute force, so there are 9600 times 96k FMAs per second.  That’s about 2 billion FMAs per second for both ears.  (Again, this is a ridiculous way to do this.)  The fancy nonlinear compression stuff will be negligible in comparison. From some quick Googling, you could easily spend a whole watt on the DSP. And there’s where all that battery charge goes :) I bet that someone who really cared about optimizing this could put some software engineering into getting DSP power down below 50mW.  Either use an FFT to optimize the filter or use a much lower complexity filter bank. reply",

          "text": "Thanks! I have hearing aids too and, while I don't have profound hearing loss (severe one side, moderate the other), it's got to the point where I am starting to look at other solutions to supplement them. For those not aware: hearing aids are not like eyeglasses, where you can effectively have your vision restored to 20/20 with the right prescription. They help, but they don't get you up to the level of a person with ordinary hearing. This goes particularly for situations with high background noise, multiple voices, etc.: restaurants, bars, parties and other places where social life tends to happen. Your recommendation has made me think I should finally take the leap on live-caption glasses, which I've been watching for a while now. It sounds like they've finally got to the point where they're effective. A question: how do you find them in conversations with multiple people? Do the glasses help you distinguish speakers by breaking out text from different voices, or is it all just a stream of words? What if there are multiple conversations going on - do the glasses manage to \"focus\" captioning on the one you're closest to, or do other conversations creep in? The captions on google meet have been useful for me as well, although I do wish they were more configurable, e.g. being able to give the captioning model a list of technical phrases, internal company terms, or acronyms that are likely to come up. There also seems to be a gap still between real time transcription, which is good, and after-the-fact transcription, which is excellent. (You can also use an LLM for the latter and prompt it yourself with extra context, although that may not be the best model.) It's been great to see so much progress in this area in the past few years. I am hoping the current (over-)investment in AI at least has the side effect of improving the tech still further. reply",

What if there are multiple conversations going on - do the glasses manage to \"focus\" captioning on the one you're closest to, or do other conversations creep in? It really depends if people are talking at the same time or not. If in a close group (space matters, the mic only goes ~2-3m), one person talking at a time, then they're great. That's the setup I most often have at conferences, so it's been great there. In evenings/parties, it's a bit more chaotic, and the glasses tend to fall off for sure. Regarding distinguishing different speakers etc I haven't needed that, I use the glasses as a helper, they fill in the gaps. So it's \"just a stream of words\", but it has been enough to already help a ton. The directional mic does work quite well, but sometimes you have just 2 conversations happening in front of you and it's not working at all. In other setups (especially professional ones), people usually speak one at a time and it works great. reply",

But considering the kind of hardware they most likely are using, how is the captioning actually happening? I'm really scared of getting hardware that is 100% cloud dependent, as eventually the company gets bought or shut down, and then you end up having to repeat the process of figuring out what to buy next, and sometimes that just one or two years in the future. They are not making it clear how the captioning is happening, but since they don't claim it'll continue working even if the company disappears/shuts down, one can be safe to assume it's a cloud product, meaning it won't actually be a good fit for most people out there with a limited amount of money to spend on things like these. Edit: I realize now this product is not at all for people like me, \"Boost caption accuracy up to 98%\" and \"More accurate translations\" are locked behind a $15/month subscription, kind of disgusting how they hide making the product work as it should behind a subscription. I just want some simple glasses that can caption what people are saying without ripping me off, I guess we're too late into capitalism for that to actually be made for consumer. reply",

With the Oticon, if I made a cellphone call, the iPhone would use the default iPhone microphone while the audio would stream to my hearing aids.  It was good that way because in a noisy environment I could hold the iphone right up to my mouth and the other party would be able to hear what I was saying. With the newer Phonaks, I was very disappointed to find that the new hearing aids would only use the microphone input that is built into the hearing aids themselves, and not the iPhone mic input.  I discovered this when I realised that talking directly into iPhone mic did not make it any easier for the other party to hear me. I complained to my Audiologist who explained that yes, the new hearing aids were copying the behaviour of Apple AirPods, which also have the mic input on the earpod itself, and that there was no way at all to configure the Phonaks to use the iPhone mic input instead. Why is this a problem you might ask?  Because my hearing aids are Behind The Ear (BTE) and thus the mic input on the hearing aid is a good 4 inches away from my face and thus my voice cannot possibly sound as clear as when I could speak directly into an iPhone mic. When I next replace my hearing aids, I shall look for aids that do not mimic this crappy AirPods behaviour... reply",

Even the next generation Philips  9050 that supported Auracast didnt support this. We ended up with Phonaks rebranded as Sennheisers. The audio quality during calls may not be as clear as a separate mic (what i believe you refer to as oticon), but from a user experience its nice to not have to fish out your phone to answer a call or wonder why you can hear the other person but they cant hear you.

It’s a brain thing, my hearing itself is above average for my age (40), so I’m not sure what exactly can be done, but there was an article many years ago about someone (Bose?) working on aids for that issue, no idea what came of it. I guess all modern hearing aids have some focus mode.

You use half a dozen microphone transducers (minimum; Crappy microphone transducers are cheap and quality is expensive, so just use a bunch of them), and through a combination of phase and intensity they decode relative location, and amplify that phase expectation while suppressing everything that isn't phased like that. Sound is slow, and readily susceptible to real-time triangulation. The math/processing is much easier if the parallaxes are fixed (eg the microphones are arranged in a line array on the top band of a rigid pair of smart glasses), but with a little latency it's not prohibitive for a deformable array to solve for its own relative position as well. reply",

I currently have Oticon Opn1’s and have had Oticons since 2017 (and got new ones in 2022) and they are fabulous. I find the sound quality in noisy environments much better than any other aid I’ve had - much better perception of voices in restaurants, for example. I rarely have to fiddle with the volume control and in fact do not even use any other settings than the main program - I find that whatever the core program is doing tends to be basically what I want. I also very much appreciate that they can natively connect to iPhones (this is also essentially the main reason I have an iPhone). This makes phone calls and music and podcasts very easy. (Whereas up until 2017, I used to dread phone calls.) I actually tried Phonaks briefly in 2022 and hated them. Lots of controls to fiddle with (some with oddly unintuitive names), but that meant I was constantly trying to adjust it and was rarely able to just exist in the moment. I found them markedly worse in noisy environments - I basically couldn’t have a conversation in a restaurant. reply",

They are comfortable, have musical audio quality (Widex works with musicians), very low latency (reducing comb filter effect), and in general look and feel very professional. As for technology, they use bluetooth low energy to connect to the smart phone, which works really well, with the caveat that the range is quite low and if it is in the pocket and you are moving around, media sound will often disrupt or desync intermittently. On the plus side, they last well over a day even with media use (WIdex says they last 37 hours without bluetooth use and that checks out). The case provides charge for about a week, and has wireless and usb-c charging. They are quite pricey, but there are several options (110, 220, 330, 440), and the 220 were more than enough for me. The app has several modes, including directional focus mode, and you can define your own. I sometimes use a different mode for listening to concert music, that disables most filters such as volume protection. I am wearing them for 9 months now, and there was no situation (concerts, traveling, work, sports, etc) were they gave me any issues whatsoever. reply",

          "text": "Audiologist and hearing aid user here. It's a great time to be looking for new hearing aids! Speech in noise capabilities have improved massively this generation, and I can personally attest to this. For me, the most important performance metric is speech perception in noisy / challenging listening situations. For you there might be other considerations, so keep that in mind. With that said, my recommendation are the new Phonak Infinio Sphere devices with with their \"Spheric speech in noise\" feature. It's a complete game changer in terms of speech perception in loud noise. Activating this program in a noisy situation feels like turning off the background noise, leaving only (nearby) voices. The caveat is that to achieve this they use a separate, power-hungry processor and compensate by increasing the battery size (making the whole hearing aid bigger than other, similar hearing aids). The upside to this is that if you're _not_ using the spherical program, you'll have really good battery life. I use mine for exactly 16 hours a day and if I'm careful I can make them last almost three full days. The charger is much better than the previous ones; they use magnets to keep the devices in place instead of relying on plastic friction. The Oticon Intent and new Starkey AI aids are also great. You should always try more than one model before you make a decision. Happy to answer any questions! reply",

I tried Phonaks and found that the use of Bluetooth to connect to my iPhone was painfully flakey (there were certain locations in my neighborhood that every time I walked in front of a particular house, I would lose audio). I ended up returning them and the only MfI hearing aids the audiologist I went to (I was limited by what was in-network by my insurance and while the old insurance covered equally in-network and out, my new insurance covered 0% out of network so I was going to be looking at double the price to go to Costco). I ended up with Resound which are essentially the same as the Jabras. The one thing that I find absolutely essential is using ear molds instead of domes. My cousin hated ear molds and gave up on them, but I definitely prefer them. Incidentally, I would recommend the HA/hearing loss subreddits (r/HearingAids and r/hardofhearing) over HN for this discussion. The HA group can get a little rigid, but I really like the community at HoH. reply",

Oticon just announced/released their 'Zeal' product - a non-custom CIC, with seemingly all the bells and whistles, including bluetooth.\nPlanning to try them soon. I have tried a few aids before (Starkey and some older Phonak) and I do really like the Oticon 'sound'. They work for me, but of course YMMV. I think many aid manufacturers (many of them the same company - WDH!) do 60 day trials. Worth a shot. My only dislike is the new fad, particularly of Oticon, of stopping disposable batteries and only going rechargeable.\nDisposable zinc-air cells have great life (I'd get a week on the Opns at least, with a few hours streaming per day). I travel for work a lot, so carrying a couple of tiny 312's in my wallet or keychain was perfect.\nThe Zeal look to have what Oticon think is a 'compact' charger - but it ain't small.\nMy kingdom for a charger the size of the AirPods Pro case... reply",

Market data ingest, analysis and resulting order execution is chewing through way more data way faster than any banking transaction system. I have worked on both of them.

You may be thinking of high frequency trading. In that case, traders interact directly with an exchange - e.g. via direct market access[1] - so it’s a pre-established two-party interaction. There’s no particular technical difficulty with making that fast. Usually, slow transaction times are a consequence of the structure of the market, not a technical issue particularly.

My point is really that if transactions are taking minutes to complete, that's likely to be a social/structural problem, not a technical one. With today's technology and all the work in this space, it's not particularly technically difficult to get such times down into the seconds or milliseconds, depending on the constraints. Yes, HFT has gone to extremes to get trade execution times down as low as microseconds. And sure, that involves technical challenges. But they're mostly sort of obvious ones - you mentioned some of the major categories - that yield to throwing engineering talent at. But I was referring to the Pareto 80% of gains here. reply",

There are plenty of financial systems that takes days or weeks to fully process transactions. You're probably referring to stock trading systems (which by their nature have to be extremely low latency). The term to search for is \"HFT\" (high-frequency trading).

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">We’re hitting a classic distributed systems wall and I’m looking for war stories or \"least worst\" practices.<p>The Context: We maintain a distributed stateful engine (think search/analytics). The architecture is standard: a Control Plane (Coordinator) assigns data segments to Worker Nodes. The workload involves heavy use of mmap and lazy loading for large datasets.<p>The Incident: We had a cascading failure where the Coordinator got stuck in a loop, DDOS-ing a specific node.<p>The Signal: Coordinator sees Node A has significantly fewer rows (logical count) than the cluster average. It flags Node A as \"underutilized.\"<p>The Action: Coordinator attempts to rebalance/load new segments onto Node A.<p>The Reality: Node A is actually sitting at 197GB RAM usage (near OOM). The data on it happens to be extremely wide (fat rows, huge blobs), so its logical row count is low, but physical footprint is massive.<p>The Loop: Node A rejects the load (or times out). The Coordinator ignores the backpressure, sees the low row count again, and retries immediately.<p>The Core Problem: We are trying to write a \"God Equation\" for our load balancer. We started with row_count, which failed. We looked at disk usage, but that doesn't correlate with RAM because of lazy loading.<p>Now we are staring at mmap. Because the OS manages the page cache, the application-level RSS is noisy and doesn't strictly reflect \"required\" memory vs \"reclaimable\" cache.<p>The Question: Attempting to enumerate every resource variable (CPU, IOPS, RSS, Disk, logical count) into a single scoring function feels like an NP-hard trap.<p>How do you handle placement in systems where memory usage is opaque/dynamic?<p>Dumb Coordinator, Smart Nodes: Should we just let the Coordinator blind-fire based on disk space, and rely 100% on the Node to return hard 429 Too Many Requests based on local pressure?<p>Cost Estimation: Do we try to build a synthetic \"cost model\" per segment (e.g., predicted memory footprint) and schedule based on credits, ignoring actual OS metrics?<p>Control Plane Decoupling: Separate storage balancing (disk) from query balancing (mem)?<p>Feels like we are reinventing the wheel. References to papers or similar architecture post-mortems appreciated.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "There's a simple solution: don't use mmap().  There's a reason that databases use O_DIRECT to read into their own in memory cache.  If it was Good Enough for Oracle in the 1990s, it's probably Good Enough for you. mmap() is one of those things that looks like it's an easy solution when you start writing an application, but that's only because you don't know the complexity time bomb of what you're undertaking. The entire point of the various ways of performing asynchronous disk I/O using APIs like io_uring is to manage when and where blocking of tasks for I/O occurs.  When you know where blocking I/O gets done, you can make it part of your main event loop. If you don't know when or where blocking occurs (be it on I/O or mutexes or other such things), you're forced to make up for it by increasing the size of your thread pool.  But larger thread pools come with a penalty: task switches are expensive!  Scheduling is expensive!  AVX 512 registers alone are 2KB of state per task, and if a thread hasn't run for a while, you're probably missing on your L1 and L2 caches.  That's pure overhead baked into the thread pool architecture that you can entirely avoid by using an event driven architecture. All the high performance systems I've worked on use event driven architectures -- from various network protocol implementations (protocols like BGP on JunOS, the HA functionality) to high speed (persistent and non-persistent) messaging (at Solace).  It just makes everything easier when you're able to keep threads hot on locked to a single core.  Bonus: when the system is at maximum load, you remain at pretty much the same number of requests per second rather than degrading as the number of threads ready to run starts increasing and wasting your CPU resources needlessly when you need them most. It's hard to believe that the event queue architecture I first encountered on an Amiga in the late 1980s when I was just a kid is still worth knowing today. reply",

There are insanely dirty hacks that you could do to start controlling the fallout of the page faults (like playing games with userfaultfd), but they're unmaintainable in the long term as they introduce a fragility that results in unexpected complexity at the worst possible times (bugs).  Rewriting / refactoring is not that hard once one understands the pattern, and I've done that quite a few times.  Depending on the language, there may be other options.  Doing an mlock() on the memory being used could help, but then it's absolutely necessary to carefully limit how much memory is pinned by such mappings. Having been a kernel developer for a long time makes it a lot easier to spot what will work well for applications versus what can be considered glass jaws. reply",

It's simple and predictable, although it's not going to get you the best throughput, predictability and simplicity is often better than perfection. If you always send each node 1/Nth of requests, worst case of a node that is broken but looks up is that you're still sending it a share when it should get nothing; if you have some sort of utilization based metric, if it looks underutilized because it's just dropping requests and responding with success but empty, it sucks up all your requests. Alternatively, people have good results with select M nodes by metrics, and then random selection between those.

          "text": "This actually seems like a simple example of memory request vs limit. Request the amount of memory needed to be healthy, you can potentially set the limit higher to account for \"reclaimable cache\". Another way to approach it if you find that there are too many limiting metrics to accurately model things: is you let the workers grab more segments until you determine that they are overloaded. Ideally for this to work though you have some idea that the node is approaching saturation. So for example: keep adding segments as long as the nth percentile response time is under some threshold. The advantage of this approach is you don't necessarily have to know which resource (memory, filehandles, etc) is at capacity. You don't even necessarily have to have deep knowledge of linux memory management. You just have to be able to probe the system to determine if it's healthy. I can even go backwards with a binary split mechanism. You sort of bring up a node that owns [A-H] (8 segments in this case). If that fails bring up 2 nodes that own [A-D],[E-H], if that fails, all the way down to one segment per node. reply",

The amount of the reservation will be deducted from the host's available memory for scheduling purposes, regardless of whether the container actually consumes the reserved amount. It's also a best practice to configure the memory limit to be identical to the reservation, so if the container exceeds the reserved amount, the kernel will terminate it via the OOM killer. Of course, for this to work, you have to figure out what that reserved amount should be. That is an exercise for the implementer (i.e., you).

It smells like you're trying to provision resources based on an optimistic prediction of your working set size. Perhaps you need a more pessimistic prediction. It might also be that you're relying too heavily on the kernel to handle paging, when what you really need is a cache tuned for your application that is scan-resistant, coupled with O_DIRECT for I/O. reply",

          "text": "It might have a minor beneficial impact to tourism in Saint Barthelemy and Norfolk Island from geeks wanting a trendy new account registered in a territory with fewer than 1000 IPv4 addresses allocated.[1] A more useful addition would be a contributions calendar similar to GitHub's [2] but focused on which time zones the user is active within, and importantly, the latency of the user's replies. It's trivial to fake geographic location observed through source IP addresses (or even RTT multilateration) but much harder to fake time zones a user is active within, particularly if monitoring latency of replies. edit: To further clarify, I don't think a contributions calendar would be beneficial to HN either. I've never cared to think about the country a commenter resides in, and don't care about username/real name either unless the commenter is appealing to their own authority (e.g. \"I am the author of this software\"). Even then, the usefulness of an appeal to own authority is often limited to the ability to reverse lookup the user's personal website (which itself is proven to be notable from other sources) for a link back to their HN profile.

Seemingly, it's the same kind of misalignment that makes people loudly complain when political threads get flagged and killed. This site is specifically a salon where a bunch of pseudonymous \"too smart\" nerds opine about topics that stimulate their curiosity, following guidelines on best-intent and good-faith that are essentially debate rules. Sometimes, amidst those discussions, you'll witness seemingly personal anecdotes or seemingly insider insights, which you should always be taking as a grain of salt, used only to drive (or repel) your own curiosity and desire for more discussion and debate. It's not a great place for earnest politics, activism, or anything so serious and existential. And because it doesn't aim to be, it doesn't beg for disclosures like location. As long as you can \"talk the talk\" here, and follow the guidelines, you're welcome to participate in the discussion how you'd like, without being measured by your person, its history, or its geography. Its great to have a place like that online. reply",

          "text": "Privacy: Won't meaningfully impact privacy. HN like any forum is a bad place to post your secrets simply because the servers are not yours. Post history for each account is already visible, so if you have an agenda, it sticks out like a sore thumb there. Moderation: Won't meaningfully impact moderation. HN can already see this info and they are the ones that take moderator action. It may hurt moderation/increase moderation costs because people may tend more to report content based on country instead of content. Transparency: Outright influencer content (political or corporate) doesn't make it to the front page enough for it to matter, or if it does, I can't tell. Anti-abuse: Same as moderation. Abuse reports should be processed based on content and not country of origin. Meaningfully improves discussion quality: If a story is about something happening in a particular country, people who look like they are from that country might get asked more or different questions. This puts people from that country on the spot. They may get increased unsolicited communication or thread hijacks. Right now, if someone wants to be on that spot, they can voluntarily identify, either in the profile or in the post. Possibly something useful would be a rule/requirement that claiming to be from a country different than the one you made an account from--seen either in a profile or post--requires verification for further posting, but if you never make such a contrary claim, the verification is not needed. reply",

It's weirdly controversial to suggest that a large number of accounts on any platform are \"shill\" accounts, despite that the fact there are clear incentives for these to exist and it's not particularly hard to make one. Even today with social networks being quite large, a few votes in your target direction can majorly swing the ultimate outcome: on reddit just 5-10 downvotes will get the collective to see the comment is \"bad\" and continue downvoting, on HN you just need a handful of people to flag a post and it will disappear from the front page (similarly you only need a few upvotes that HN doesn't detect as ring to get to the home page). Any puppet account you recognize is one that has already failed. Just like with websites, time is a major factor in detecting these type of accounts. So if you can get away with posting relatively innocuous content in an automated way for a few years you can build \"trust\" on these various platforms. reply",

          "text": "I think that due to how sophisticated anti-bot measures have gotten, bots now go through a \"life cycle.\" An engagement bot spends the first phase of it's life building up an innocent and legitimate looking history. It does this by blending into the noise with innocuous and pointless comments that you'd never take a second glance at, and definitely not report or flag. Then when the account has aged and is in good enough standing, metamorphosis to the adult stage occurs, and the bot starts posting the kind of blatant spam that you'd think would be automatically ban filtered, but somehow isn't. These bot farmers are quite literally farming bots like vegetables and selling them when they've ripened. I am very confident that this is the case in YouTube comments, where most people find they can not use violent words like \"kill\" or \"genocide\" when discussing war, but somehow there are bots posting uncensored racial slurs. reply",

          "text": "\"Disclose\" is kinda ambiguous here. One of the hindrances to getting a patent is prior art. Meaning that the thing you're trying yo patent already exists. After a patent is issued lots of people typically say \"but that's obvious\". Ok, so let's capture the obvious before someone patents it. Equally, I might be doing something which is patentable, but I have no interest in patenting it. By registering it somewhere I make it easy for the patent office to search, thus turning down a patent application. Thus preventing me being sued by some new patent holder. But to answer the question, no I wouldn't use a service like this. Partly because I wouldn't spend the money and partly because (in isolation) the service doesn't work. Unless the patent office is involved and actively using it, bad patents still get granted. Yes, it might add some weight to a court case where I'm being sued, but honestly if I get there I've already lost. And my code backups show the same thing anyway. Plus, which of the thousands of things I am doing, should I register? Am I supposed to trawl through my code deciding on each line if it's novel? If I do all this work I might as well just get a patent. That can at least be used in cross-licencing agreements. Yes, software patents are a blight, but I'm not sure this is really a solution. reply",

What Poopalert does is use smartpipes (toilet drains equipped with smart device tech such as employee biomedical health monitoring) - so it uses smart pipes to see if there is an unflushed toilet.  Then are staff will go flush and clean, so the next guy gets the proper clean experience, and we dock the phantom shitter a small premium for the service which goes to our bonus pool.  Anyway, with the smartpipes we can also tell if an employee is unwell or a risk, basically assess their healthy status, and cull the herd so to speak by firing the bottom 10% least healthy workforce. This will lead to an organization of obedient, respectful, team players, all of which are very healthy - and make our custodial duties - or doodies as it were - much easier!! reply",

          "text": "Previously you had a few choices, go with: 1. PayPal, who wanted to own the customer relationship 2. A payment processor who all had awful APIs and you had to do lots of setup around having a merchant account. Authorize.net I think was one of these. Recurring payments were often a nightmare to get to work. 3. An intermediary processor, who didn't need you to have a merchant account, nochex, Worldpay, sagepay, etc. who again generally all had awful APIs and hard to embed widgets and complicated setup processes. Again, recurring payments a nightmare. Stripe solved all these pain points, and the API was great. It wasn't one pain point they solved, it was many. You controlled the customer relationship, it was easy to embed the stripe widget, it had a great API, you didn't need a merchant account and the setup was quick and easy. Recurring payments were (fairly) easy to set up. Oh, and great documentation! That was another big thing. And then they brought out a little widget you could attach to your phone/tablet to allow easy in-person card payments! It probably seems a bit incomprehensible now, but this was a time when everyone did everything slightly awkwardly. Integrating with any third party was a big job. Documentation was terrible. Formats were all over the place. SOAP, XML, JSON was only just emerging as the defacto standard. For example, the APIs. Great APIs were rare, as far as I remember twilio and I think MailChimp really blazed the way there. Companies like Google were putting out absolute dogshit, complicated APIs, often strict REST with weird header requirements, or strange signing with private keys. If you've never dealt with it, strict REST really, really sucks. reply",
