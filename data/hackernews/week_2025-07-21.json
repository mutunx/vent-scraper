          "text": "Very old coder here. Wrote COBOL to help Atari add features to a inventory processing system to account for the fact that \"inventory\" intially was items received at the loading dock, fork-lifted to the shipping dock and shipped. So \"inventory\" needed to be booked immediately as sales. Now I dabble mostly with Python and JS/HTML. My memory of the Atari gig was that the most critical part was the CICS code. There was just one guy who knew enough to setup the CICS. If he got hit buy a bus... Well after about a year, the bus would not have mattered. Atari buried millions on unsold carts, and I went from working in a beautiful office complex next to Great America Park, to a windowless basement closet somewhere near Mountain View now making changess because the \"forklift inventory\" version was no longer needed. I know this is a bit off topic, but \"COBOL\" was the into I needed. reply",

The system contained records of all their policies including all the premium factors (e.g. make, model, year of car, parking location, physical address, etc). These premium factors were then fed into a rating engine which would use actuarial tables with custom actuarial defined algorithms to determine premiums. In insurance companies, working out the correct premium is core to everything. Insurance companies can have lots of different products and their competitive edge comes from how well they structure their offerings and determine the correct premiums based on risk factors. One does not simply rewrite such a thing. Couple of things I thought were a bit interesting about the place: - Their single server running Universe Basic (with a hot spare I believe) had 4TB of RAM.\n- While I was used to the devs being the stars of the show at the consulting house I worked at, at insurance companies it’s the actuaries. reply",

          "text": "I think you got most details from the others, but insurance is two basically two different things: Life Insurance is mostly a savings product, and the insurance part protects you if you live too long. Property and casualty insurance protects you from losses, including someone's life, but also houses, cars, etc. The domains are quite different, but they both have specific \"insurance business\" computing that's related to actuarial science or analysis, i.e. the statistics needed to calculate reserves, policies, prices etc. I doubt COBOL is used for any actuarial analysis. I think SAS is still strong, but I suspect R is used now. Maybe Python is used in the more static calculations that are handed over to developers, but the actuaries are typically coding whatever they need when they create their models. The rest is just case management, automating business rules, bookkeeping, payments, and for life insurance also systems for trading securities and funds, and possibly in-house tools for asset management. There isn't really a strong case for COBOL. The only reason COBOL still is used is that the insurance companies where early adopters and saw computing as a way to reduce the administrative overhead. The investments were made at a time when trusting some hippies running UNIX wasn't really on the table, and even less so trusting some nerds and their rickety PCs. They built up a workforce with COBOL devs that also gained quite a lot of business knowledge. The digitalisation created another problem - a lot of the older employees were hired to do simple administrative tasks. Even big corporations aren't totally psychopathic so it actually has taken a long time to shift out the employees, and retrain the remainder for the jobs that got more demanding. Even the employees that didn't really have that much high-value domain-specific knowledge to begin with. So the case for more automation was actually not as strong as it could have been. Even still, although especially life insurance is a totally digital product (damage claims is not), they primarily see IT as a cost centre at heart although they probably claim they do not. This has shaped their systems and they have tended to replace their old systems when they're forced by external factors, as the upsides  - better digital sales, more automated decisions, better trading experience for their customers,etc \nare not as easy to achieve as the more tangible administrative automation cost savings they started out with. Actually, this also applies to banks. You could totally run an insurance company or bank without any mainframes or a single line of COBOL. But the organisations still have COBOL developers and maybe more important an upper management that come from that tradition. reply",

Integrations are mostly file based but we do both call and expose APIs (“regular REST APIs”) as well as consuming from and producing to Kafka among other things. We integrate with both mainframe and distributed systems on prem as well as “internal” systems hosted on cloud. We use Git for source control but have a CI/CD solution that is built in house.

As a result, these legacy systems are often using default passwords, have tons of crazy stuff exposed to the network, and are comprised of custom code written specifically for the business purpose (so the documentation is only as good as what they made). On the other hand, these guys generally write pretty neat, lean code that is quick, reliable, and directly responsive to the business.

Super handy while reading someone's else code, which is like 90% on large projects. 2. Quick refactorings. Often times I see people discuss in lengths what would/could be instead of just go and try it out quickly, seeing all the pros and cons. Many times I proven myself wrong by trying it out and seeing pitfalls I didn't see earlier. 3. Warnings: so many real bugs could've been prevented if developers had seen (or cared about) to IDE showing a warning. Many PR review suggestions are detectable by a proper IDE without wasting reviewer's time. 4. Hotkeys (what the parent comment was talking about) -- speeds up all of that, especially refactorings, freeing dev's brain for thinking of architecture and other problems. I can go on an on. Sometimes it feels like 50%+ of AI usage for coding is to free up fingers, not knowing that they were already mostly free by using static analysis features/hotkeys. reply",

And also having worked at IBM in the past where I sat adjacent to the mainframe support team for Business Services, I totally get it. Mainframes are awesome if you ask me, and in a sense we have been trying to reinvent a lot of its goodness with \"commodity\" x86 hardware. From a technical-cultural perspective it was mostly sulkiness, and a complete and utter lack of embracing the paradigms of distributed computing. Also, like most internal clouds, there were plenty of issues as it was. Initially they just tried to replace mainframe application components 1:1 onto VMs in whatever way and whenever anything was <100% reliable they complained that our cloud was not able to do it. I had to explain in a very harsh way, under a lot of pressure (I believe not hitting the deadline of switching off the mainframes meant renewal for a year at 40 Mil.. or thereabouts) the realities of \"cloud\". The developers I spoke with in that time though, were very much the opposite of the move fast breaking things crowd. Intelligent, but also narrow minded I would say. reply",

Additionally everybody who knew the COBOL side of things was retiring at the same time as she was and she did not want to know what the system would look like in five years. reply",

          "text": "I haven't worked in COBOL, but I've worked with it. This was around 1999, and I was building a system for configuring and ordering custom PC's at a large distribution company. One of the feature requirements was that we display inventory over the various options. (ie: There are 373 20G disks in stock, but only 12 30G disks in stock). The idea was that this would let a customer ordering 200 machines know that they should pick the 20G disk if the wanted it now. The way inventory at this company was done was via two systems. There was a normal SQL database that had access to a daily snapshot of inventory taken from a mainframe that always had the up to date data. With the mainframe taking a while to process queries, we used the less current SQL database for the majority of the UI, but took the time to query the mainframe once a customer was in the shopping cart.  Customers might see a change during the flow, but it would at least let them see the most current data prior to committing to a purchase. The mainframe query itself was implemented by someone else as a COBOL job that produced the required inventory numbers.  From my point of view, it was just a limited sort of query conducted over a specialized JDBC driver. (Not necessarily the weirdest aspect of that design.... for a variety of reasons, we did the UI in ASP/VBScript, the back end using Microsoft's JVM invoked via COM Automation, and the SQL database link was via a dubious use of a JDBC/ODBC bridge to connect to SQL Server. It all worked, but not the most solid architecture.) == My only other mainframe experience was working as an intern for a utility company a few years prior (1991-1992). They used CDC Cyber mainframes to run the power grid, using something like 4MM lines of FORTRAN code. The dispatchers themselves interfaced to the system using consoles with 4 19\" color displays running at 1280x1024. Heady stuff for 1991. (The real time weather radar screen was cool too, in an age before the internet made it common place.) reply",

I was the head of product at Pocket in 2018/19, and ever since I left, I’ve had this itch to build my own version. Mozilla shutting it down finally gave me the excuse I needed. https://savewithfolio.com/ Folio lets you save articles from anywhere, has a lovely reading view, lets you listen to articles with some really nice text-to-speech voices, and access all your saves offline across all of your devices. If you enjoyed Pocket, you'll feel right at home! It’s still early days but all the core features are solid and working well. Pocket imports are available via their API (though it’s been a little flaky lately), and I’m wrapping up file imports from Pocket, Instapaper, Matter, Raindrop, and Readwise so it should be easy to make the switch really soon. Lots of fun stuff planned ahead. I’d love to have you join us if you’re looking for a new home! reply",

Relay is also collaborative, so I frequently clip things, clean them up a bit, and move them into shared folders (like docs pages). I like the feeling of local-first combined with a malleable UX.

Case studies in certain engineering/programming tasks, something I read that I found useful and want to have handy to share with others in the future, project ideas or notes for long-running efforts I pursue and sometimes want a \"bucket to pull from\" for instance. While it's certainly true that I probably _use_ 10-20% of what I bookmark, I don't think it would be possible to realize the same positive outcomes without the 80% that I don't.  (Just last week I was able to braindump a large piles of 'examples/essays I found helpful learning about neural network optimization' to one of my engineers because I'd kept them handy after they helped me.) I should say though, I sense this is a slightly different use case than the \"I want to read this article just to read it\" bookmarks where I know I never will, which is certainly something I've experienced but is a minority case in my life nowadays, so I wanted to vouch for productive scenarios too. reply",

          "text": "I depended heavily on Pocket for over a decade as a free user.  It started to get bogged down with about 20k bookmarks.  I used to spend hours manually tagging saves and the search function never seemed to actually return results.  This time around I wanted a self hosted solution. I looked at Walabag and Shiori before I decided on Karakeep.  I just didn't like the UI of the first two.  I already have an Ollama server and the AI tagging feature of Karakeep is far better than Walabag's, in fact the tag management feature in general is.  And Meilisearch adds a really fast search engine to Karakeep that has allowed me to discover new value to the 16k bookmarks from Pocket after cleaning down from the 20k I exported, it's super impressive. Now the less great news, Karakeep is much newer and less mature than the other options and currently only supports a SQLite backend and I really hope that changes.  The only API for Karakeep goes through its web interface and so I don't think I even could export all my bookmarks.  If the data was stored in a standalone real database like MySQL or PostgreSQL other options would be possible. The AI tagging is AMAZING but it generates a LOT of tags and that makes the tag management screens in Karakeep difficult or impossible to use because they are overwhelmed.  I am looking forward to the next and future releases which aim to help with this. I use the Android app which works really well. Karakeep does make your server into a web crawler and because of the little war on AI LLMs we're experiencing these days an unfortunate number of websites have started to fight all crawling.   Karakeep uses a SingleFile browser extension which allows you to prove you are a human or log in to a website and then capture a page and submit it to Karakeep.  This is a little awkward because you may end up bookmarking something once using the regular Karakeep extension and then see that you didn't get what you want and have to do it again via SingleFile.  I'm hoping that at least a config list will be added so that the regular Karakaap browser extension will automatically invoke SingleFile for websites known to block bots. reply",

          "text": "I stopped using Pocket, Instapaper, and the likes in my ongoing effort to be able to walk out[1] whenever I want/need to. I tried out and still wanted to have something that keeps archives of the content I like to read. That is also largely resolved with Archive.org. So, I end up with just a plain-text of some of the links I want as bookmarks. If they shut down or go away; its fine. I have tested a few similar app. I'm currently happy with a minimal foot-print of Shiori.[2] I tried and liked the UI/UX of Readeck[3] better but it has its own convoluted saving and sharing (public) style and way of working. I didn't want to deal with that. Shiori saves a local copy (my default), and I can read it later. I also default it to public share so I can share with people asking for similar topic and such. It is a single Go binary with support for sqlite3, PostgreSQL, MariaDB and MySQL as its database. Most of the online services such as archivebox.io, raindrop.io, readwise.io, and the plethora of other replacements are cheap enough but I've been long enough on the Internet to know that I have to deal with the loss yet again. Here is an example of Shiori Saved and Shareable article https://read.oinam.com/bookmark/39/content 1. https://brajeshwar.com/2025/can-i-walk-out/ 2. https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori 3. https://readeck.org/en/ reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Hi everyone. I'm making an app called HRAM (hand-rolled assembly machine), and I plan to release it this week. But I need some beta testers first. Please send me an email at admin@90s.dev if you're interested. Your feedback will be helpful enough that I'll give you a free license. The app is only for Windows (10 or 11).<p>The app is programmable via Lua and has an assembly library built in, so you can create and run assembly functions at runtime. It has a 320x180 pixel screen that you can manipulate to help you practice assembly. The point of the app is to help learn low level concepts, in the fun environment of making a retro style game. I'm also in the process of adding threading/mutexes/etc also, but that may have to wait post release.<p><i>Very</i> early manual, likely to change dramatically: https://hram.dev/docs.txt<p>Thanks for your time, have a great Sunday!</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Someone requested clarification on another post, so here it is: It's a native Win32 app, with a window of 320x180 pixels, which scales upwards as you resize bigger. By itself the program does nothing except read and run a specific Lua file located in AppData. Drawing to the screen is the main operation of the program. The Lua API has a few built in modules: - \"image\" for dealing with gpu images, which includes the screen - \"lpeg\" so you can write a custom parser - \"asm\" so you can compile and run assembly code from Lua - \"memory\" so you can read and write to real memory addresses It uses real memory: All the APIs, including the assembly you write, can access real memory addresses. So you can write to 0x20000 and read from it, either in Lua or Asm, and it just works. And you get raw pointers as Lua integers that you can pass around, which lets you pass them through assembly and back. The app has a few competing primary purposes: - Learn or practice writing x64 win32 assembly - Learn or practice writing a programming language - Learn or practice writing video games like it's 1979 - Learn or practice writing programs that manage raw memory reply",

LLM inference hasn't been too useful for me for writing code, but it has proven very useful for explaining my coworkers' code to me. Recently I had Gemma3-27B-it explain every Python script and library in a repo with the command: $ find -name '*.py' -print -exec /home/ttk/bin/g3 \"Explain this code in detail:\\n\\n`cat {}`\" \\; | tee explain.txt There were a few files it couldn't figure out without other files, so I ran a second pass with those, giving it the source files it needed to understand source files that used them.  Overall, pretty easy, and highly clarifying. My shell script for wrapping llama.cpp's llama-cli and Gemma3: http://ciar.org/h/g3 That script references this grammar file which forces llama.cpp to infer only ASCII: http://ciar.org/h/ascii.gbnf Cost: electricity I've been meaning to check out Aider and GLM-4, but even if it's all it's cracked up to be, I expect to use it sparingly.  Skills which aren't exercised are lost, and I'd like to keep my programming skills sharp. reply",

Even Claude is only marginally better than Gemini (at coding), and they all suck to the point that I wouldn't trust any of them without reviewing every line. Far better to just pick a tool, get comfortable with it, and not screw around too much. I don't understand people who pay hundreds of dollars a month for multiple tools.

Every day it was the same discussion over again, from someone who didn't bother to do a Google search or look at what was posted the day prior. After a week or so of seeing the same discussion over and over again, I stopped reading the news site. Needless to say, it's important to occasionally have discussions like this. I also think we under-appreciate the amount of moderation that goes on here. Sometimes I look at the \"new\" feed and it is just loaded with lots and lots of nonsense, so I get that someone has to put their finger on the scale to keep the quality up. reply",

The solution is not to divide the community and make people unwelcome, but to provide at least some minimal set of filters and ways to opt out of the hype frenzy. I don't want people to feel unwelcome, but I do wish there was a way to turn the AI firehose off. reply",

After a while things settled down, and all players use the tool in some way or another. Some chess players benefited more from the tool than others. I always analyze my games carefully with an engine after the game. After less than 10 years I managed to get from zero to almost master level. I attribute that to extensive engine analysis I put on my games afterwards. The user needs to know how to use the engine, LLM or chess engine, when it makes sense to use it, what are the shortcomings of the tool and so on. LLMs are game changers, and AI's ability to distinguish the signal from noise is marvelous. Will it be a game changer like it is now for chess, a very narrow game compared to everything else, remains to be seen. reply",

When I first saw this thread earlier today, there were 12 AI-related posts on the front page. Even more oddly, threads unrelated to AI somehow still end up getting hijacked by AI-related comments. I use AI and find it very useful, but I really don’t see the reason to bring it up all the time. Not everything needs to be framed around AI, and constantly forcing it into unrelated discussions just dilutes real conversations. It feels less like enthusiasm and more like obsession.

It is weak because this tool is strongly coupled to the problem: filtering HN. It's an example of the more general problem of people wanting to control what they see. This has existed at least since the classic usenet \"killfiles\", but is an area that, I believe, has been ripe for a comprehensive local solution for some time. OTOH, narrow solutions validate the broader solution, especially if there are a lot of them. Although in that case you invite a ton of \"momentum\" issues with ingrained user bases (and heated advocacy), hopelessly incompatible data models and/or UX models, and so on. It's an interesting world (in the Chinese curse sense) where such tools can be trivially created. It's not clear to me that fitness selection will work to clean up the landscape once it's made. reply",

The value can be a lot more for some people than others: - Utility-wise:\nIf you need to perform at work.. even if having it every day means the coffee nolonger changes from your original no-coffee baseline.. - Social:\nMy girlfriend doesn't really go to the expensive coffee shop because it's worth the 2x marker. It's because she can chat about relationships, have security in her relationships with her friends and they can designate this as an unscheduled-long time to talk through issues - Regulating your emotions\nFor me at least buying something small and pleasant can avoid troughs/peaks. In fact overstressing the financial ratio of cost:price of a product causes these troughs for me. That's also why poorer people often buy small but tasty things, even when it's pricy for them, it regulates their mood up enough to slog through the rest of the 1am shifts with difficulty seeing the future (I have been there...) That's why I'd be wary of having an app pressure you not to buy something. You don't always know the real reasons your body gets you to do things. reply",

          "text": "Utility-wise: I specifically mentioned same amount of coffee so this one is moot. Social: most coffee is consumed for takeaway and on Auto-Pilot. In the usa most starbuckses make 80%! From takeaway and 20% from sit ins (they tried to close some Starbucks locations because of this but the funny part is that sales drop more than the 20%... Probably because people take the \"cost of the store\" into their reasoning why they are spending 7-12$ on a cup of Joe.) -regulating your emotions: if you are in a luxury position that's fine... Being / perceiving / stressing about being poor causes a drop of 8 IQ points. I know/understand what you mean and changing a default always causes stress but the question is always about short term pain vs long term gain...\nNobody likes to change... Being told what to do... The app is not pressuring you - it's making you aware of options / costs that you might not have considered. (Did you know)\nThe thing is that if the app is well made and you trust the maker you know you have a \"friend\" who is looking out for you... Even though you might still ignore him/her (think friends who smoke cigarettes etc...) The brain's main goal is not too think because it tries to preserve energy... Unfortunately the environment is simultaneously safer (we killed all animals that literally can kill us) and more dangerous (our fellow humans who used to stand next to us having our back against the animals are often against our interests now.) The question is always what is a low effort high reward substitute...\nI'd say takeaway coffee is probably one of the best options for a lot of people. The art is just to visualize the profit you're gonna make in the future in the now --- because your brain focuses on the now...\nIf I said to you that if you drink a coffee less every other day you'd \"make\" 4140$ in 5 years would you --- pretty sure for most people in dire financial straits they would... On the other hand not meeting with your friend for brunch once a month might save you more even but a friend is harder to substitute than some sugary beverage... The question is always \"why\" - the \"suffering\" now is always certain (change is painful if it is not perceived as improvement) but by making the future gains big, visual and realistic people (can be) more self motivated. reply",

But assuming it's true, I would also assume that \"anyone\" is somewhat exclusive to people who already understand or have the ability to understand how existing SaaS products work. So that just means every company should have a team of people creating whatever SaaS products they need that week. Except that would create so much unreasonable amount of codes to support that the point would be that coding would simply be a race to build edge case scenarios to account for everything. which is also a huge issue. and so i think that the true skill to have that will offer competitive advantage is people management. alternatively some domain knowledge. since domain knowledge will give you the standpoint to decide what you should be doing. but i think a lot of this is kind of overblown. like you aren't really going to want an AI generated on the fly payments system like Stripe or an HR system like tripletex.

          "text": "Not sure if it's appropriate to post ChatGPT's response here, but I gave the same challenge to o3 and it's response was: ```\n2025-07-20 10:32\nThat’s an exhilarating challenge! But here’s the sober reality: *1. Scale & Surface Area* * *Jira* and *GitLab* each represent well over a decade of engineering effort from dozens‑to‑hundreds of developers, QA, designers, product managers, and SREs.\n* They’re not just web apps—they’re ecosystems: issue tracking, CI/CD pipelines, permissions, integrations, APIs, marketplace extensions, mobile clients, high‑availability clustering, compliance tooling, analytics, and elaborate permission models. *2. Engineering Effort in One Week*\nEven an aggressive “strip‑to‑core‑features” build would demand: | Area                         | Must‑Have Functionality         | Typical Complexity | Realistic Time (solo) |\n| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |\n| Auth & user management       | SSO, 2FA, roles                 | weeks              | 3‑4 weeks             |\n| Issue / Merge request model  | CRUD, workflow, attachments     | months             | 4‑6 weeks             |\n| Git backend or sprint boards | Repo storage or board drag‑drop | months‑years       | 8‑12 weeks            |\n| CI runner orchestration      | Job scheduler, logs, artifacts  | years              | 6‑12 months           |\n| Notifications & webhooks     | Email, Slack, webhooks          | weeks              | 3‑4 weeks             |\n| Security & compliance        | RBAC, audits, CVE patching      | ongoing            | Ongoing               | That’s after *scope‑cutting to the bone*—and still well beyond seven days for even a seasoned full‑stack team. *3. Minimum Viable “Clone”*\nIf the goal is a demo that looks Jira‑ or GitLab‑like and handles the absolute basics (login, create issue, simple Kanban board or Git repo viewer), you’d still need: * *Pre‑built OSS components* (e.g., Focalboard, Gitea, Drone CI)\n* *Glue code* to stitch UI, auth, and database models\n* *DevOps* for cloud deploy, backups, SSL, monitoring\n* *Acceptance tests* so the demo doesn’t fall over during the pitch With a well‑coordinated *5‑7 person tiger team*, an MVP façade might be shown inside a week—but it would be fragile, feature‑poor, and nowhere near production‑ready. *4. What \\$1 million can buy fast* * *Fork & skin* an existing open‑source platform (e.g., Forgejo for GitLab‑like, OpenProject or Plane for Jira‑like).\n* Hire a *dedicated squad* (engineers, designer, DevOps) on a 3‑to‑6‑month crash program to reach parity for the specific subset of features you actually need.\n* Budget for *security audit, uptime SLA, and ongoing maintenance*—because the first release is only the beginning. *5. Suggested Next Steps* 1. *Clarify scope:* Which exact capabilities do you really need on Day 1?\n2. *Select a foundation:* OSS codebase vs. greenfield build.\n3. *Form a team + timeline:* Realistically 12–24 weeks for a hardened v1 with a mid‑sized team.\n4. *Milestones & deliverables:* Demo, beta, public launch, enterprise tier.\n5. *Contingency planning:* Budget for security, scaling, and feature creep. If you’d like, I can help map out a detailed project plan, assemble a tech‑stack recommendation, or break down resourcing and costs. Let me know how you’d like to proceed!\n``` :-) reply",

I m a junior level developer (not entry level though) that has been working on a company that creates systems for banks. A coworker of mine attended a presentation done by the company that focused on a project that would normally be done by a group of 5 people over a span of 6 months, but was done by a single person on merely 6 days through a no-coding / vibe coding platform.<p>This made me worry more than ever for the threat of becoming obsolete on my career due to the evolution of AI. What do you all think here? Is a programming career in legit threat under AI, more than other careers at least? And how long term you estimate the actual threat to be in this case? Lastly, how do you think it would be a good idea for a programmer to move like in order to conform to the new standards, aside ofc from using AI to help with work whenever it makes sense to do so?</p></div>",

Sometimes, though, reading the transcription, I find it hard to figure out which speaker is speaking what. I have to listen to the audio to figure it out.

I think that adding a speaker diarization step might make the transcription easier to understand and analyze.<p>I am looking for Speaker Diarization tools that I can use.

And so (as I referred to a couple comments down) OpenAI and the others are in the Google pre-2006 moment where the products are highly successfully engaging and grabbing our attention, but they haven't quite found the business model that prints money in the way Google Ads do.

          "text": "Yup, but my earlier comment was a bit flippant, so here’s a more in-depth response. It was an answer to the OP’s question about why Gmail search feels broken, and a nod to the previous comment pointing out Google’s core business is selling ads. In that context, Gmail isn’t optimized for superior search. It’s part of a data funnel that enables keyword targeting, ad placement, and behavioral profiling. For me, there’s a deeper product lesson here, but also a signal about how someone thinks. Whether a candidate answers “ads” or “search” or “email” isn’t what really matters. It’s the why behind the answer that matters most. At the end of the day, business models directly shape product decisions. That tension is something every product manager has to navigate because they sit between the business and technical sides of a company. Being able to see and articulate that tradeoff, especially when user needs diverge from monetization incentives, is key to both building effectively and being a successful product manager. More often the business model, like subscriptions, is more tightly connected to the product. User has X problem that product Y solves and the company receives Z dollars in exchange for access. However, there are many examples where the pricing or monetization strategy is not so clearly connected to the feature set, of which google search is a great example. For the record, I don't ask this question to junior PMs. reply",

I keep thinking of writing an IMAP->SQL interface¹ so I can search more manually that way. Or even just mapping to files in a filesystem² so I can find/grep/etc, though the DB option would also allow some more complex searches (search for X in messages that are replies to messages containing Y, for example). -------- [1] Keeping mail on the mail server, but syncing it with a DB. This is more complicated than it would first sound as it will mean decoding MIME and various sub-encodings to extract the plain text so I can properly query it, hence that project is still on my “when hell freezes over so I have enough free time” list. [2] Yeah, maildir and similar storage formats already do this, but there is still the unpacking/decoding issue before being able to directly search the text of many messages. reply",

My primary email is apart of some vast international spam program where the mail servers responsible for sending me spam forge headers, falsify source record information, lie about which downstream service provider is hosting them, etc. It’s really quite interesting, but more so than that, it’s annoying. I pondered my problem for a few days, thinking about what sort of external service I could use to surgically remove these numerous, daily, very specifically identifiable spam emails before I stumbled on a thread on StackOverflow where some people discussed using Google App Scripts to do this very thing. I’d recommend searching the web for that sort of topic. You’ll find that there’s a way to set up an hourly script job that will wipe this spam completely off your mailbox and find some peace. Hope this points you in the right direction. The idea of having to use yet another Google service to fix an existing separate one is such a stupid labyrinthine experience, but at least it beats having to set up a job on a VPS for this. If you had this issue with another mailbox service provider, a VPS approach would probably be necessary, though. reply",

Somebody saved that post and extracted all the links in to the CSV file with their name and karma, and put it on a website(it's not there now).\nI've downloaded that CSV file and slowly went through all 1626 blog links over the last 2 years. I finished just about a week ago. It was quite a journey! Some links I would glance at the homepage and immidiately close, and some I stayed for days - reading all interesting articles from the Archive link. It was a blast! reply",

          "text": "I've been working on something that directly targets this problem: WFGY — a reasoning engine built for RAG on large-scale PDF/Word documents, especially when you're doing deep research, not just shallow QA. Instead of just chunking text and throwing it into an embedding model, WFGY builds a persistent semantic resonance layer — meaning it tracks context through formatting breaks, footnotes, diagram captions, even corrupted OCR sections. The engine applies multiple self-correcting pathways (we call them BBMC and BBPF) so even when parsing is incomplete or wrong, reasoning still holds. That’s crucial if your source materials are academic papers, messy reports, or 1000+ page archives. It’s open source.\nNo tuning.\nWorks with any LLM.\nNo tricks. Backed by the creator of tesseract.js (36k) — who gets why document mess is the real challenge. Check it out: https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY reply",

Wrote COBOL to help Atari add features to a inventory processing system to account for the fact that \"inventory\" intially was items received at the loading dock, fork-lifted to the shipping dock and shipped. So \"inventory\" needed to be booked immediately as sales. Now I dabble mostly with Python and JS/HTML. My memory of the Atari gig was that the most critical part was the CICS code. There was just one guy who knew enough to setup the CICS. If he got hit buy a bus... Well after about a year, the bus would not have mattered. Atari buried millions on unsold carts, and I went from working in a beautiful office complex next to Great America Park, to a windowless basement closet somewhere near Mountain View now making changess because the \"forklift inventory\" version was no longer needed. I know this is a bit off topic, but \"COBOL\" was the into I needed. reply",

The system contained records of all their policies including all the premium factors (e.g. make, model, year of car, parking location, physical address, etc). These premium factors were then fed into a rating engine which would use actuarial tables with custom actuarial defined algorithms to determine premiums. In insurance companies, working out the correct premium is core to everything. Insurance companies can have lots of different products and their competitive edge comes from how well they structure their offerings and determine the correct premiums based on risk factors. One does not simply rewrite such a thing. Couple of things I thought were a bit interesting about the place: - Their single server running Universe Basic (with a hot spare I believe) had 4TB of RAM.\n- While I was used to the devs being the stars of the show at the consulting house I worked at, at insurance companies it’s the actuaries. reply",

          "text": "I think you got most details from the others, but insurance is two basically two different things: Life Insurance is mostly a savings product, and the insurance part protects you if you live too long. Property and casualty insurance protects you from losses, including someone's life, but also houses, cars, etc. The domains are quite different, but they both have specific \"insurance business\" computing that's related to actuarial science or analysis, i.e. the statistics needed to calculate reserves, policies, prices etc. I doubt COBOL is used for any actuarial analysis. I think SAS is still strong, but I suspect R is used now. Maybe Python is used in the more static calculations that are handed over to developers, but the actuaries are typically coding whatever they need when they create their models. The rest is just case management, automating business rules, bookkeeping, payments, and for life insurance also systems for trading securities and funds, and possibly in-house tools for asset management. There isn't really a strong case for COBOL. The only reason COBOL still is used is that the insurance companies where early adopters and saw computing as a way to reduce the administrative overhead. The investments were made at a time when trusting some hippies running UNIX wasn't really on the table, and even less so trusting some nerds and their rickety PCs. They built up a workforce with COBOL devs that also gained quite a lot of business knowledge. The digitalisation created another problem - a lot of the older employees were hired to do simple administrative tasks. Even big corporations aren't totally psychopathic so it actually has taken a long time to shift out the employees, and retrain the remainder for the jobs that got more demanding. Even the employees that didn't really have that much high-value domain-specific knowledge to begin with. So the case for more automation was actually not as strong as it could have been. Even still, although especially life insurance is a totally digital product (damage claims is not), they primarily see IT as a cost centre at heart although they probably claim they do not. This has shaped their systems and they have tended to replace their old systems when they're forced by external factors, as the upsides  - better digital sales, more automated decisions, better trading experience for their customers,etc \nare not as easy to achieve as the more tangible administrative automation cost savings they started out with. Actually, this also applies to banks. You could totally run an insurance company or bank without any mainframes or a single line of COBOL. But the organisations still have COBOL developers and maybe more important an upper management that come from that tradition. reply",

          "text": "I am working as a mainframe developer at a bank, currently within a kind of data warehouse solution. Mainly writing in COBOL and Java (in USS), with some scripting in Rexx for internal ISPF tools. A lot of SQL as well, we use DB2 as our main database. Most of our processes are EOD centric, we run a lot of batch jobs (mainly TSO, very little IMS). Integrations are mostly file based but we do both call and expose APIs (“regular REST APIs”) as well as consuming from and producing to Kafka among other things. We integrate with both mainframe and distributed systems on prem as well as “internal” systems hosted on cloud. We use Git for source control but have a CI/CD solution that is built in house. Quite a lot of other infrastructure is also built in house. I am mid 30s and am on the younger side looking at the mainframe area as a whole at my employer, however in my team we have several developers is in their 20/30s. My background is mainly back- and frontend development on the Microsoft tech stack but I have worked, and do work, with whatever is at hand/required. But mostly stuff like .NET and SQL Server on the backend, and Angular/Vue/React on the front end before this. reply",

They would be able to shave off an insane percentage off expenses (in the form of employees whose job exists for no real reason), but the switching costs would also be immense.

          "text": "Hard disagree. Few points I can easily remember: 1. Navigating the code, e.g easily see all the callers, navigate up/down the call tree requires static code analysis. Super handy while reading someone's else code, which is like 90% on large projects. 2. Quick refactorings. Often times I see people discuss in lengths what would/could be instead of just go and try it out quickly, seeing all the pros and cons. Many times I proven myself wrong by trying it out and seeing pitfalls I didn't see earlier. 3. Warnings: so many real bugs could've been prevented if developers had seen (or cared about) to IDE showing a warning. Many PR review suggestions are detectable by a proper IDE without wasting reviewer's time. 4. Hotkeys (what the parent comment was talking about) -- speeds up all of that, especially refactorings, freeing dev's brain for thinking of architecture and other problems. I can go on an on. Sometimes it feels like 50%+ of AI usage for coding is to free up fingers, not knowing that they were already mostly free by using static analysis features/hotkeys. reply",

And also having worked at IBM in the past where I sat adjacent to the mainframe support team for Business Services, I totally get it. Mainframes are awesome if you ask me, and in a sense we have been trying to reinvent a lot of its goodness with \"commodity\" x86 hardware. From a technical-cultural perspective it was mostly sulkiness, and a complete and utter lack of embracing the paradigms of distributed computing. Also, like most internal clouds, there were plenty of issues as it was. Initially they just tried to replace mainframe application components 1:1 onto VMs in whatever way and whenever anything was <100% reliable they complained that our cloud was not able to do it. I had to explain in a very harsh way, under a lot of pressure (I believe not hitting the deadline of switching off the mainframes meant renewal for a year at 40 Mil.. or thereabouts) the realities of \"cloud\". The developers I spoke with in that time though, were very much the opposite of the move fast breaking things crowd. Intelligent, but also narrow minded I would say. reply",

          "text": "I haven't worked in COBOL, but I've worked with it. This was around 1999, and I was building a system for configuring and ordering custom PC's at a large distribution company. One of the feature requirements was that we display inventory over the various options. (ie: There are 373 20G disks in stock, but only 12 30G disks in stock). The idea was that this would let a customer ordering 200 machines know that they should pick the 20G disk if the wanted it now. The way inventory at this company was done was via two systems. There was a normal SQL database that had access to a daily snapshot of inventory taken from a mainframe that always had the up to date data. With the mainframe taking a while to process queries, we used the less current SQL database for the majority of the UI, but took the time to query the mainframe once a customer was in the shopping cart.  Customers might see a change during the flow, but it would at least let them see the most current data prior to committing to a purchase. The mainframe query itself was implemented by someone else as a COBOL job that produced the required inventory numbers.  From my point of view, it was just a limited sort of query conducted over a specialized JDBC driver. (Not necessarily the weirdest aspect of that design.... for a variety of reasons, we did the UI in ASP/VBScript, the back end using Microsoft's JVM invoked via COM Automation, and the SQL database link was via a dubious use of a JDBC/ODBC bridge to connect to SQL Server. It all worked, but not the most solid architecture.) == My only other mainframe experience was working as an intern for a utility company a few years prior (1991-1992). They used CDC Cyber mainframes to run the power grid, using something like 4MM lines of FORTRAN code. The dispatchers themselves interfaced to the system using consoles with 4 19\" color displays running at 1280x1024. Heady stuff for 1991. (The real time weather radar screen was cool too, in an age before the internet made it common place.) reply",

          "text": "I’ve been working on my own Pocket replacement for the past few months. I was the head of product at Pocket in 2018/19, and ever since I left, I’ve had this itch to build my own version. Mozilla shutting it down finally gave me the excuse I needed. https://savewithfolio.com/ Folio lets you save articles from anywhere, has a lovely reading view, lets you listen to articles with some really nice text-to-speech voices, and access all your saves offline across all of your devices. If you enjoyed Pocket, you'll feel right at home! It’s still early days but all the core features are solid and working well. Pocket imports are available via their API (though it’s been a little flaky lately), and I’m wrapping up file imports from Pocket, Instapaper, Matter, Raindrop, and Readwise so it should be easy to make the switch really soon. Lots of fun stuff planned ahead. I’d love to have you join us if you’re looking for a new home! reply",

Relay is also collaborative, so I frequently clip things, clean them up a bit, and move them into shared folders (like docs pages). I like the feeling of local-first combined with a malleable UX.

Case studies in certain engineering/programming tasks, something I read that I found useful and want to have handy to share with others in the future, project ideas or notes for long-running efforts I pursue and sometimes want a \"bucket to pull from\" for instance. While it's certainly true that I probably _use_ 10-20% of what I bookmark, I don't think it would be possible to realize the same positive outcomes without the 80% that I don't.  (Just last week I was able to braindump a large piles of 'examples/essays I found helpful learning about neural network optimization' to one of my engineers because I'd kept them handy after they helped me.) I should say though, I sense this is a slightly different use case than the \"I want to read this article just to read it\" bookmarks where I know I never will, which is certainly something I've experienced but is a minority case in my life nowadays, so I wanted to vouch for productive scenarios too. reply",

          "text": "I depended heavily on Pocket for over a decade as a free user.  It started to get bogged down with about 20k bookmarks.  I used to spend hours manually tagging saves and the search function never seemed to actually return results.  This time around I wanted a self hosted solution. I looked at Walabag and Shiori before I decided on Karakeep.  I just didn't like the UI of the first two.  I already have an Ollama server and the AI tagging feature of Karakeep is far better than Walabag's, in fact the tag management feature in general is.  And Meilisearch adds a really fast search engine to Karakeep that has allowed me to discover new value to the 16k bookmarks from Pocket after cleaning down from the 20k I exported, it's super impressive. Now the less great news, Karakeep is much newer and less mature than the other options and currently only supports a SQLite backend and I really hope that changes.  The only API for Karakeep goes through its web interface and so I don't think I even could export all my bookmarks.  If the data was stored in a standalone real database like MySQL or PostgreSQL other options would be possible. The AI tagging is AMAZING but it generates a LOT of tags and that makes the tag management screens in Karakeep difficult or impossible to use because they are overwhelmed.  I am looking forward to the next and future releases which aim to help with this. I use the Android app which works really well. Karakeep does make your server into a web crawler and because of the little war on AI LLMs we're experiencing these days an unfortunate number of websites have started to fight all crawling.   Karakeep uses a SingleFile browser extension which allows you to prove you are a human or log in to a website and then capture a page and submit it to Karakeep.  This is a little awkward because you may end up bookmarking something once using the regular Karakeep extension and then see that you didn't get what you want and have to do it again via SingleFile.  I'm hoping that at least a config list will be added so that the regular Karakaap browser extension will automatically invoke SingleFile for websites known to block bots. reply",

          "text": "I stopped using Pocket, Instapaper, and the likes in my ongoing effort to be able to walk out[1] whenever I want/need to. I tried out and still wanted to have something that keeps archives of the content I like to read. That is also largely resolved with Archive.org. So, I end up with just a plain-text of some of the links I want as bookmarks. If they shut down or go away; its fine. I have tested a few similar app. I'm currently happy with a minimal foot-print of Shiori.[2] I tried and liked the UI/UX of Readeck[3] better but it has its own convoluted saving and sharing (public) style and way of working. I didn't want to deal with that. Shiori saves a local copy (my default), and I can read it later. I also default it to public share so I can share with people asking for similar topic and such. It is a single Go binary with support for sqlite3, PostgreSQL, MariaDB and MySQL as its database. Most of the online services such as archivebox.io, raindrop.io, readwise.io, and the plethora of other replacements are cheap enough but I've been long enough on the Internet to know that I have to deal with the loss yet again. Here is an example of Shiori Saved and Shareable article https://read.oinam.com/bookmark/39/content 1. https://brajeshwar.com/2025/can-i-walk-out/ 2. https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori 3. https://readeck.org/en/ reply",

Typically I would either find a warm intro from a past colleague, or I would specifically find someone involved in the hiring pipeline at the company on Linkedin and say \"Hey im so and so, and blah blah blah, im thinking of applying but would love if you could tell me more about the role and the culture before I commit\" From here, so long as you baseline can stand out as a solid engineer and communicator those US only barriers fall down. This is why to someone elses point\n> if they’d hire you, why wouldn’t they hire someone much cheaper. They'd hire someone cheaper certainly, provided they could find a person with identical quality, similar culture, and near PST timezones. Which is a fairly tall order in reality.

Plus, they might be happier with a lower salary in a lower cost of living, especially if the quality of life is boosted by weather/location/food/hot people into foreigners. American salaries likely anchor high though, and you can probably still get a decent amount above locals for the same work. Plus even if you were mid, you'd be mid for the upper tier market.

My shell script for wrapping llama.cpp's llama-cli and Gemma3: http://ciar.org/h/g3 That script references this grammar file which forces llama.cpp to infer only ASCII: http://ciar.org/h/ascii.gbnf Cost: electricity I've been meaning to check out Aider and GLM-4, but even if it's all it's cracked up to be, I expect to use it sparingly.  Skills which aren't exercised are lost, and I'd like to keep my programming skills sharp. reply",

If you want to skimp you can drop one of the GPUs until you're sure you need 48GB VRAM and some of the RAM but you really don't save that much. Just make sure you get a case that can fit multiple full size GPU and a mobo that can support it as well. The slot configurations are pretty bad on the AM5 generation for multi GPU. You'll probably end up with a mobo such as Asus ProArt Also none of this is worth the money because it's simply not possible to run the same kinds of models you pay for online on a standard home system. Things like ChatGPT 4o use more VRAM than you'll ever be able to scrounge up unless your budget is closer to $10,000-25,000+. Think multiple RTX A6000 cards or similar.

To me this seems like the subtext is \"Those people are not welcome here,  they are not like us.   It's not like we have anything against them, we just don't want them ramming it down our throats\" Anyone is free to make a website with whatever content they want,  they can invite people to it and grow your own community.    Directing a community to divide to remove an element you dislike is an attempt to appropriate the established community. reply",

After a week or so of seeing the same discussion over and over again, I stopped reading the news site. Needless to say, it's important to occasionally have discussions like this. I also think we under-appreciate the amount of moderation that goes on here.

          "text": "It must have been somewhat the same when chess engines started to beat human players. The chess community should be fairly divided about the usefulness of such a tool. After a while things settled down, and all players use the tool in some way or another. Some chess players benefited more from the tool than others. I always analyze my games carefully with an engine after the game. After less than 10 years I managed to get from zero to almost master level. I attribute that to extensive engine analysis I put on my games afterwards. The user needs to know how to use the engine, LLM or chess engine, when it makes sense to use it, what are the shortcomings of the tool and so on. LLMs are game changers, and AI's ability to distinguish the signal from noise is marvelous. Will it be a game changer like it is now for chess, a very narrow game compared to everything else, remains to be seen. reply",

There were so many posts about how all the topics are about crypto and how it is annoying. Ultimately, all that noise and the billions of dollars poured into that turned into a meme if we're honest. Most people just buy/flip crypto or hold BTC that they'll sell when they double it after a year. AI in LLM form is at least useful in many ways and in front of millions of people without any rugpulls and other shit, but due to their inherent limitations (doesn't matter how much python it writes and executes, half the time or more its wrong for any actual/meaningful work) I think the hype will settle in the next couple of years. reply",

Since then, they've increased to: - \"show hn\" \"llm\" – 2,417 (+54) - \"show hn\" \"ai\" – 13,376 (+248) - \"show hn\" \"vibe coded\" – 23 (past month) That’s about 6 LLM-related and 27 AI-related posts per day, just in the \"show hn\" category. When I first saw this thread earlier today, there were 12 AI-related posts on the front page. Even more oddly, threads unrelated to AI somehow still end up getting hijacked by AI-related comments. I use AI and find it very useful, but I really don’t see the reason to bring it up all the time. Not everything needs to be framed around AI, and constantly forcing it into unrelated discussions just dilutes real conversations. It feels less like enthusiasm and more like obsession. Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if there is a non-negligible amount of astroturfing going on across HN.

I find I can do that with granular enough subreddits, or the (maybe old) feature in Twitter where you could group people you follow into lists and see multiple \"homepages\". This for me has solved the issue of dividing community, which at the least from a practical level can be tricky. Ive been exploring how to achieve this effect \"on top\" of HN lately, rather than by controlling followers, by popping a very simple AI filter on top that re-ranks it for me, and found it quite satisfying, but not sure what the ultimate value/usecase might be. reply",

It is weak because this tool is strongly coupled to the problem: filtering HN. It's an example of the more general problem of people wanting to control what they see. This has existed at least since the classic usenet \"killfiles\", but is an area that, I believe, has been ripe for a comprehensive local solution for some time. OTOH, narrow solutions validate the broader solution, especially if there are a lot of them. Although in that case you invite a ton of \"momentum\" issues with ingrained user bases (and heated advocacy), hopelessly incompatible data models and/or UX models, and so on. It's an interesting world (in the Chinese curse sense) where such tools can be trivially created.

The graininess and low framerate of the video made it a lot harder to tell that it was AI generated than the usual shiny, high res, oddly smooth AI look. There were only very subtle tells - non-reaction of bystanders in the background, and a physics mistake that was easy to miss in the commotion. We're very close to nearly every video on the internet being worthless as a form of proof. This bothers me a lot more than text generation because typically video is admissible as evidence in the court of law, and especially in the court of public opinion. reply",

They happen because the language model hits a semantic dead-end — a kind of “collapse” where it can't reconcile competing meanings and defaults to whatever sounds fluent. We’re building WFGY, a reasoning system that catches these failure points before they explode. It tracks meaning across documents and across time, even when formatting, structure, or logic goes off the rails. The scariest part?\nLanguage never promised to stay consistent. Most models assume it does.\nWe don’t. Backed by the creator of tesseract.js (36k)\nMore info: https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY reply",

The mass extraction and substitution of art has also caused a lot of unnecessary grief. Instead of AI enabling us to pursue creative work… it’s producing slop and making it harder for newbies to develop their craft. And making a lot of people anxious, fearful, and angry. And finally of course astroturfing, phishing, that kind of thing has in principle become a lot more sophisticated.

The value can be a lot more for some people than others: - Utility-wise:\nIf you need to perform at work.. even if having it every day means the coffee nolonger changes from your original no-coffee baseline.. - Social:\nMy girlfriend doesn't really go to the expensive coffee shop because it's worth the 2x marker. It's because she can chat about relationships, have security in her relationships with her friends and they can designate this as an unscheduled-long time to talk through issues - Regulating your emotions\nFor me at least buying something small and pleasant can avoid troughs/peaks. In fact overstressing the financial ratio of cost:price of a product causes these troughs for me. That's also why poorer people often buy small but tasty things, even when it's pricy for them, it regulates their mood up enough to slog through the rest of the 1am shifts with difficulty seeing the future (I have been there...) That's why I'd be wary of having an app pressure you not to buy something. You don't always know the real reasons your body gets you to do things. reply",

          "text": "Utility-wise: I specifically mentioned same amount of coffee so this one is moot. Social: most coffee is consumed for takeaway and on Auto-Pilot. In the usa most starbuckses make 80%! From takeaway and 20% from sit ins (they tried to close some Starbucks locations because of this but the funny part is that sales drop more than the 20%... Probably because people take the \"cost of the store\" into their reasoning why they are spending 7-12$ on a cup of Joe.) -regulating your emotions: if you are in a luxury position that's fine... Being / perceiving / stressing about being poor causes a drop of 8 IQ points. I know/understand what you mean and changing a default always causes stress but the question is always about short term pain vs long term gain...\nNobody likes to change... Being told what to do... The app is not pressuring you - it's making you aware of options / costs that you might not have considered. (Did you know)\nThe thing is that if the app is well made and you trust the maker you know you have a \"friend\" who is looking out for you... Even though you might still ignore him/her (think friends who smoke cigarettes etc...) The brain's main goal is not too think because it tries to preserve energy... Unfortunately the environment is simultaneously safer (we killed all animals that literally can kill us) and more dangerous (our fellow humans who used to stand next to us having our back against the animals are often against our interests now.) The question is always what is a low effort high reward substitute...\nI'd say takeaway coffee is probably one of the best options for a lot of people. The art is just to visualize the profit you're gonna make in the future in the now --- because your brain focuses on the now...\nIf I said to you that if you drink a coffee less every other day you'd \"make\" 4140$ in 5 years would you --- pretty sure for most people in dire financial straits they would... On the other hand not meeting with your friend for brunch once a month might save you more even but a friend is harder to substitute than some sugary beverage... The question is always \"why\" - the \"suffering\" now is always certain (change is painful if it is not perceived as improvement) but by making the future gains big, visual and realistic people (can be) more self motivated. reply",

Each $10/m reduced is a gold star. You get to buy a frappe each time you do that. (Less than one month). It's a good goal because you can reduce interest by paying off and also by consolidation and refinancing. reply",
