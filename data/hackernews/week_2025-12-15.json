At a high level, Google does not have a product culture, so there is a lot of white space for companies like ours to make adopting Google Cloud APIs much easier for less technical users. It's also wild how much Agentic AI is creeping into all of our conversations - this space is constantly evolving as we're building. reply",

They can order their hot chocolate and their coffee as if they were going to grab something at a fancy café downtown, but instead it's at home and I'm the barista. It is quite nice to have for when my wife comes back from work and want something specific, or when we are waiting for the visit of a few friend, they can order exactly the available beverages and everything is ready when they're here. It was also a good playground for me to implement Web Push notifications (to never miss new orders). It's a basic Nuxt 3 app with Appwrite as the backend with rough edges, but much enough for our household use ! If you want to spam my phone with notifications, please visit my café : https://mytinycafe.com/alix reply",

          "text": "https://meetlace.ai - LACE, a self-organising research companion for long-horizon inquiry. With LLMs, generating ideas and snippets is cheap; what’s hard is keeping track of fragments with their “why I cared” context over months. Most tools (Notion/Obsidian/etc.) assume you will do the work (folder/tag/linking) structure  will maintain it forever. I don’t. In LACE we:\n– capture fragments from the web via a browser extension\n– auto-cluster them into evolving “threads” / projects with summaries & reading lists\n– maintain a graph of connections across threads (“topology of attention”)\n– let you turn a cluster of fragments into an essay draft when you’re ready to share. Stack is a fairly standard web app + LLM pipeline. Used neo4j's llm-graph-builder as a starting point. The interesting bit is self-organising graph. treating fragments/questions/lines of inquiry as first-class objects and letting the system reorganise around them over time instead of fixed folders. It’s in a small test phase right now. If you’re a researcher/writer/engineer/founder who constantly loses good ideas in your notes and want to try something opinionated in this space, I’d love feedback. background write-up: https://open.substack.com/pub/ozthinks/p/from-fragments-to-i... reply",

UI is very nice and simple, one tiny bit of feedback is that a 'guidelines' page would be worthwhile, especially while it's new! I thought I'd post my own project on the site - sometimes that's a little bit of a no-no though, and I couldn't find any guidelines to steer me towards what types of things to share, etc. Edit: Tiny extra feedback, is upvoting something immediately changes the rankings in the browser. It's pretty impressive speedwise, but especially if you're a couple pages in, you can bump something off of the page you're on which makes it a little weird to do something like 'upvote article and then check the comments'. reply",

I've updated a port of WxWidgets and now I support all the features KiCad needs with ~200 tests. Right now I have a build that loads in the browser, but I really want to have \"multithreading\" which means workers in the web. One can use asyncify with emscripten to translate blocking C++ to WASM, but that transition is not perfect, right now I'm debugging a bug where there's a race condition that halts all execution and the main thread runs in an infinite loop waiting for the workers to stand up. I guess I'll have a few of those ahead. The main goal is to 1. just have fun 2. use yjs as a collab backend so multiple people can edit the same PCB. This will probably work with pcbnew, KiCad's layout editor, since it has a plugin system and AFAIK I can do the sync layer there. For the rest ( schematic, component editor etc. ) I'll have to figure out something..\nKiCad does not sync automatically if you modify a file, I'll have to do some lifting there. Anyway, it's a lot of fun, I really want this thing to exist, I'm hoping that I won't run into a \"wellll, this is just not going to work\" kind of issue in the end. reply",

We just won silver at the Big Indie Pitch competition as well! - Currently in free Early Access with 18 competitive mini-games. - Players use their mobile phones as controllers (you can use game pads as well!) - Everything is completely web-based, no downloads or installs are necessary to play - All games support up to 8 players at a time and are action based, with quick ~one minute rounds to keep a good pace. This means there are no language based trivia or asynchronous games! - In the future we plan to open up the platform for 3rd party developers (and Gamejams!) as well. We take care of the network connectivity, controllers etc.. 3rd party devs can focus on developing cool multiplayer mini-games without spending an eternity with networking code and building the infrastructure.

          "text": "On the subject of whisper being great... A few weeks ago a co-worker commented about the difficulty he'd had editing a work demo, I pointed at various jump-cutting tools that had automated what he did in the past (editing out silences). But I'd also wanted to play with whisper for a while... So a couple of hours later I'd written a script that does transcription based editing: on the first pass it grabs a timestamped transcript and a plain text transcript for editing; you edit the words into any order you like and a second pass reassembles the video (it's just a couple of hundred lines of python wrapping whisper and ffmpeg). It also speeds up 4x any silences detected that sit within retained sequences in the video. Matching up transcripts turns out to be not that hard; I normalise the text, split it, and then compare to the sequence of normalised words from the timestamped transcript. I find the longest common sequence, keep that, then recurse on the before/after sections (there's a little more detail, but not much). I also sent the transcription to ffmpeg to burn in as captions, because sometimes it makes the audio choppy and the captions make it easier to follow. I know, tools have been doing this for years now. I just didn't have one to hand, and now I do, and I couldn't have done this without whisper. reply",

Paul Graham’s idea that essays are a way to learn really resonates with me. But I rarely publish anything beyond occasional LinkedIn posts.<p>My blockers:<p>•“Nobody needs this” / “It’s not original”<p>•“AI can explain most topics better than I can”<p>•A bit of fear: shipping something that feels naive or low-signal<p>At the same time, I read a lot of personal blogs + LinkedIn and I do get real value from them — mostly from perspective, lived experience, and clear thinking, not novelty.<p>For those of you who blog (or used to):<p>•What made it worth it for you?<p>•What kinds of posts actually worked (for learning, career, network, opportunities)?<p>•Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)?<p>•If you were starting today, what would you do differently?<p>I’m not trying to build a media business — more like building a “public notebook” that compounds over years.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

And making it public also inspires me to spend a bit more time thinking about it and double-checking some things before putting it out there. Sometimes I get a nice comment on a years-old blog post and that's also rewarding. Additionally, sometimes I search for something and have my own years-old blog post come up, reminding me that I already solved that thing before and can reuse the solution. * All posts have worked to consolidate knowledge and help me think. * Since you're just trying to build a public notebook, what are you trying to lower the bar to? Your own writing motivation or something else? If the former, just write to the length/cadence/themes you're interested in and don't write what you're not interested in. * Maybe I'd go back and tell pretty-much-teenage-me to stop being so cringe because this stuff will still be there 20 years later. reply",

Above all, it's accessible to everyone, not just those on a specific platform. I've had a blog for almost 20 years. Nowadays, it's the best record I have of what I'm interested in and working on. It has recipes I send to my friends, context for strangers. It's a beacon that attracts similar people, a call for them to reach out. And it works! I get emails about my posts. I helped people travel along the same routes, and fixed people's technical issues. Another blog of mine turned into a lifestyle business. I have met countless friends and two lovers through it. So yeah, do your thing, put it online. Start simple, migrate as needed. I love static sites because they're low maintenance. Hugo and a theme would be good. reply",

You say you're not trying to build a media business, and want to build a \"public notebook\", but you imply you're looking for career/networking opportunities. You're also not clear if the \"learning\" is for you as the author, or for the reader. If you want to have your content discovered online, I'd say you might be in for some trouble, although I don't think AI is the cause, only an accelerator on that. Blogs for readers learning are probably in decline, you're unlikely to get any outreach based on your posts for networking. However if, like me, the writing process is the point – you're trying to clarify your thoughts, learn something new yourself, or have a document you can share with colleagues when they ask you to explain your opinions, I think blogging is valuable. While you won't get direct outreach, you can share it on your CV or send it to recruiters and you might get noticed when applying for jobs. reply",

Too many to list such as jobs, recognition in the community, but the best ones are some sort of a personal satisfaction without the need to say anything aloud. The other two things I will always remember are (i) my cousin once accompanied me to a conference where I spoke, and after seeing the people lined/gathered around to talk, “What the heck are you, what do you do!” and (ii) recently, my daughter, “Papa, I searched you on Google and you are kinda Internet-famous, you are everything if I search your name.” > What kinds of posts actually worked (for learning, career, network, opportunities)? Two ways to look at it, (i) I don't care, I will just write or (ii) focus on a topic/community/vertical and keep writing about it, even if someone has written about it, write your own opinion.\nWatch for topic upticks in that vertical/interest and write about it, even if it means adding something to the ones that is already written. @simonw does it best https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/ > Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)?

I didn't do that for the first ~20 years - I offered just an RSS feed - but when I added the Substack newsletter option it become clear I should have been gathering email addresses from a lot earlier on! Despite having a substantial audience visiting my site now I still think the best way to get traffic to an article is to tell people about it elsewhere. I follow the POSSE principle: publish on own site, syndicate elsewhere: https://indieweb.org/POSSE Honestly though quality is much more important than quantity.

Also, you have hands-on experience, which is also demonstrably more than any \"AI\" has. I urge you to ignore this kind of doubt or consideration. - What kinds of posts actually worked (for learning, career, network, opportunities)? For learning, \"book report\" type posts, just to solidify what I've read in my mind, maybe drive a little experimentation to ensure I've concluded correctly. I've decided not to collect any metrics so that I don't follow from behind, so that I don't end up doing clickbait. Career and network opportunities have not arisen from my blog. My \"public notebook\" posts get more traffic, and I've referred back to them, but for me, these are mostly Linux sysadmin topics. I'd wager these are most valuable to people that find them for very specific problems, like seeing LLDP info from inside a WiFi access point or fixing GRUB problems on particular hardware. - Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)? I have not discovered anything for this, alas. I use Hugo, I have a couple of little shell scripts to do monthly counts of finished vs draft articles. I try to stay at or above 5 posts a month. I'm not sure that helps lower the bar, which I interpret as \"provide motivation to post\". What would I do differently? Start a blog years before I actually did so.

          "text": "Hey, just wanted to let you know that your honeypot data for PHP-based attacks ended up factoring in charges being dropped in two criminal cases where prosecution attempted to run with a harebrained and ludicrous theory that basically centered around some... mythical idea of how these attacks happen and how specific they can be. The criminal justice system is where lurid fantasies of how tech works end up putting people in prison for sometimes years and budget concerns meant that attorneys filled parking meters every 4 hours and we had two full time investigators in an office of 40, most with a 80-120 caseload (rolling basis). Sometimes the data one puts online can really make an impact that my guess is that it was entirely unexpected and for two people in their 20s with young kids (separate cases, in fact, although not too far apart), it really reclaimed a good chunk of their lives. Thank you for that, and I hope others would do the same, because one never knows when it'll come in handy. So many products sold to LE are basically snake oil and without data and facts, the threat is incredibly coercive. Any leverage for defense helps balancing the playing field and frankly, nobody deserves to be taken to trial based on utter BS that has merit merely because it matches the equally unfounded anxieties of people, however unsubstantiated.Thanks again! reply",

Re blockers: - Novelty: I routinely search for very niche, \"boring\" information, and am disappointed by how few in-depth blogposts I find. - “AI can explain most topics better than I can”. I doubt it!  I rarely find current AI as valuable as a good blog post. It tends to be shallow and regress to the mean, and b/c of hallucinations it's untrustworthy, so a lot of time is wasted fact-checking. - Fear of shipping: if it isn't relevant, nobody will read it (unless you're already famous) Re questions: - What made it worth it for you? Clarifying my thoughts, connecting with strangers who think about the same things, the leverage \"having a platform\" produces (it opens a lot of doors), and gaining prestige in certain niches. - What kinds of posts actually worked (for learning, career, network, opportunities)? I don't think this is simple to answer until the heat death of the universe. Traffic stats is a very poor estimator of value delivered. Which posts I am most proud of, and how much traffic they got, are weakly correlated. - Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)? Things that you are obsessed with. It's a tonne of work writing a good post, and sometimes you publish it and nobody cares, so it has to be intrinsically rewarding. - If you were starting today, what would you do differently? I don't know! Probably put less effort into trying to appear intelligent/impressive, which rarely works anyway. These are my off-the-top thoughts based on over a decade of blogging. reply",

          "text": "Writing is difficult and like all art forms, it’s subject to impostor syndrome. Blogging is the best way I have found to remind yourself that you’re not an impostor. And the more experience you get proving you’re not an impostor, the easier impostor syndrome is to deal with. Realistically if you start now, you’re years away from a devoted readership and that’s fine. You’ll gain from publishing and if you’re diligent, you’ll gain from watching your writing improve. For me, I like writing and can’t get paid enough in publishing or as a writer to do it professionally. So it’s worth it for me because I have a lot of fun writing. I spent a good part of my life hunting for eyeballs and now I’m content just writing whether anyone reads it or not. I’m not sure that I’d recommend any particular theme, cadence or style for a new blogger. And I definitely wouldn’t recommend a style of post. Rather those sorts of things will come organically as you get used to writing and start building a community. When you’re getting started, just focus on writing, trying to build habits and learning how to edit yourself. Most writers will struggle with one of the three on their way to developing a voice so if you’re going through hell you’re likely on the right path. If I were starting today, I’d focus less on hunting eyeballs and more on writing for the joy of it. I’d also spend a lot more time writing about subjects that I’m not interested in because that’s really good practice. And finally, I wouldn’t worry so much about writer’s block - it happens, it sucks but it goes away when you stop worrying about it. On the subject of writer’s block, if it’s something you struggle with I have a great exercise for you. When you’re stuck, interview yourself about the finished piece you’re stuck on. Pretend it’s done and interview yourself. I would have started doing that twenty five years ago and I’d be a far better writer now because of it. Finally, keep everything you write and read it regularly but there’s nothing wrong with pruning your blog regularly. If things you wrote two years ago are embarrassing today that means you’re a better writer. Go with that. reply",

Force yourself to exercise every day, because that's good for your physical health, but is blogging good for your health? Writing in public is performance art. Some people are naturally performance artists and need to perform to satisfy some internal urge. If you're not one of them, don't let anyone else convince you that you need to be one. It's ok to not blog. The idea that everyone should have a blog is completely unjustified. I read another comment that said you should write blog posts at least once a week.

I haven't found a real way to solve these issues 100%, but it occurred to me that the odds of me having these problems would be lower if I paywalled my stuff or at least required registration for access.

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I've been working on a personal project recently, rewriting an old jQuery + Django project into SvelteKit. The main work is translating the UI templates into idiomatic SvelteKit while maintaining the original styling. This includes things like using semantic HTML instead of div-spamming, not wrapping divs in divs in divs, and replacing bootstrap with minimal tailwind. It also includes some logic refactors, to maintain the original functionality but rewritten to avoid years of code debt. Things like replacing templates using boolean flags for multiple views with composable Svelte components.<p>I've had a fairly steady process for doing this: look at each route defined in Django, build out my `+page.server.ts`, and then split each major section of the page into a Svelte component with a matching Storybook story. It takes a lot of time to do this, since I have to ensure I'm not just copying the template but rather recreating it in a more idiomatic style.<p>This kind of work seems like a great use case for AI assisted programming, but I've failed to use it effectively. At most, I can only get Claude Code to recreate some slightly less spaghetti code in Svelte. Simple prompting just isn't able to get AI's code quality within 90% of what I'd write by hand. Ideally, AI could get it's code to something I could review manually in 15-20 minutes, which would massively speed up the time spent on this project (right now it takes me 1-2 hours to properly translate a route).<p>Do you guys have tips or suggestions on how to improve my efficiency and code quality with AI?</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Hey, Boris from the Claude Code team here. A few tips: 1. If there is anything Claude tends to repeatedly get wrong, not understand, or spend lots of tokens on, put it in your CLAUDE.md. Claude automatically reads this file and it’s a great way to avoid repeating yourself. I add to my team’s CLAUDE.md multiple times a week. 2. Use Plan mode (press shift-tab 2x). Go back and forth with Claude until you like the plan before you let Claude execute. This easily 2-3x’s results for harder tasks. 3. Give the model a way to check its work. For svelte, consider using the Puppeteer MCP server and tell Claude to check its work in the browser. This is another 2-3x. 4. Use Opus 4.5. It’s a step change from Sonnet 4.5 and earlier models. Hope that helps! reply",

The LLM context collapse happens well before you hit the token limits, and things like ground rules and whatnot stop influencing the LLMs outputs after a couple tens of thousands of tokens in my experience.

You need a feedback loop (we all do). and the best way is for it to change things and see the effects (ideally also against a good baseline like a test suite where it can roughly guage how close or far it is from the goal.) For assembly, a debugger/tracer works great (using batch-mode or scripts as models/tooling often choke on such interactivie TUI io). - If it keeps missing the mark tell it to decorate the code with a file log recording all the info it needs to understand what's happening. Its analysis of such logs normally zeroes the solution pretty quickly, especially for complex tasks. - If it's really struggling, tell it to sketch out a full plan in pseudocode, and explain why that will work, and analyze for any gotchas. Then to analayze the differences between the current implementation and the ideal it just worked out. This often helps get it unblocked. reply",

I was previously using it repeatedly in sessions (and was getting great results). The most recent major release introduced this bug where it keeps referring back to the first plan you made in a session even when you're planning something else ( https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/12505 ). I find this bug incredibly confusing. Am I using Plan Mode in a really strange way? Because for me this is a showstopper bug–my core workflow is broken.

Using slash commands and skills for workflows that are repeatable is a really nice way to keep your rules file from exploding. I have slash commands for code review, and git commit management. I have skills for complex tool interactions. Our company has it's own deployment CLI tool so using skills to make Claude Code an expert at using this tool has done wonders to improve Claude Codes performance when working on CI/CD problems. I am currently working on a new slash command /investigate <service> that runs triage for an active or past incident. I've had Claude write tools to interact with all of our partner services (AWS, JIRA, CI/CD pipelines, GitLab, Datadog) and now when an incident occurs it can quickly put together an early analysis of a incident finding the right people to involve (not just owners but people who last touched the service), potential root causes including service dependency investigations. I am putting this through it's paces now but early results are VERY good! reply",

I have a custom 'code style' system prompt that I want claude to use, and I have been able to add it when using claude in browser - ```\nBeautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit.\nSimple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated.\nReadability counts.\nSpecial cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity.\nIf the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. Trust the context you're given. Don't defend against problems the human didn't ask you to solve.\n``` How can I add it as a system prompt (or if its called something else) in vscode so LLMs adhere to it? reply",

Heck, why isn't there a cornucopia of new apps, even trivial ones? Where is all the shovelware [0]? Previous HN discussion here [1]. Don't get me wrong, AI is at least as game-changing for programming as StackOverflow and Google were back in the day. I use it every day, and it's saved me hours of work for certain specific tasks [2]. But it's simply not a massive 10x force multiplier that some might lead you to believe. I'll start believing when maintainers of complex, actively developed, and widely used open-source projects (e.g. ffmpeg, curl, openssh, sqlite) start raving about a massive uptick in positive contributions, pointing to a concrete influx of high-quality AI-assisted commits.

          "text": "\"Heck, why isn't there a cornucopia of new apps, even trivial ones?\" There is. We had to basically create a new category for them on /r/golang because there was a quite distinct step change near the beginning of this year where suddenly over half the posts to the subreddit were \"I asked my AI to put something together, here's a repo with 4 commits, 3000 lines of code, and an AI-generated README.md. It compiles and I may have even used it once or twice.\" It toned down a bit but it's still half-a-dozen posts a day like that on average. Some of them are at least useful in principle. Some of them are the same sorts of things you'd see twice a month, only now we can see them twice a week if not twice a day. The problem wasn't necessarily the utility or the lack thereof, it was simply the flood of them. It completely disturbed the balance of the subreddit. To the extent that you haven't heard about these, I'd observe that the world already had more apps than you could possibly have ever heard about and the bottleneck was already marketing rather than production. AIs have presumably not successfully done much about helping people market their creations. reply",

I know what you mean, but the thing I find windsurf (which we moved to from copilot) most useful (except writing opeanapi spec files) is asking it questions about the codebase. Just random minutiae that I could find by grepping or following the code, but would take me more than the 30s-1m it takes it. For reference, this is a monorepo of a bit over 1M LoC (and 800k YAML files, because, did I mention I hate API specs?), so not really a small code base either. > I will break down the tasks to the same size as if I was implementing it. But instead of doing it myself, I roughly describe the task on a technical level (and add relevant classes to the context) and it will ask me clarifying questions. After 2-3 rounds the plan usually looks good and I let it implement the task. Here I disagree, sort of. I almost never ask it to do complex tasks, the most time consuming and hardest part is not actually typing out the code, describing it to an AI takes me almost as much time as implementing for most things. One thing I did find very useful is the supertab feature of windsurf, which, at a high level, looks at the changes you started making and starts suggesting the next change. And it's not only limited to repetitive things (like . in vi), if you start adding a parameter to a function, it starts adding it to the docs, to the functions you need below, and starts implementing it. > For me this method allows me to focus on the architecture and overall structure and delegate the plumbing to Copilot.

As an example, one task of the feature was to add metrics for observability when the new action was executed. Another when it failed. My prompt: Create a new metric \"foo.bar\" in MyMetrics when MyService.action was successful and \"foo.bar.failed\" when it failed. I review the plan and let it implement it. As you can see it's a small task and after it is done I review the changes and commit them. Rinse and repeat. I think the biggest issue is that people try to one shot big features or applications.

For instance I had two navigation bars in an application which had different styling and I told it make the second one look like the first and...  it made a really nice patch.  Also if I don't understand how to use some open source dependency I check the project out and ask Junie questions about it like \"How do I do X?\" or \"How does setting prop Y have the effect of Z?\" and frequently I get the right answer right away.  Sometimes I describe a bug in my code and ask if it can figure it out and often it does, ask for a fix and often get great results. I have a React application where the testing situation is FUBAR, we are stuck on an old version of React where tests like enzyme that really run react are unworkable because the test framework can never know that React is done rendering -- working with Junie I developed a style of true unit tests for class components (still got 'em) that tests tricky methods in isolation. I have a test file which is well documented explaining the situation around tests and ask \"Can we make some tests for A like the tests in B.test.js, how would you do that?\" and if I like the plan I say \"make it so!\" and it does... frankly I would not be writing tests if I didn't have that help. It would also be possible to mock useState() and company and might do that someday... It doesn't bother me so much that the tests are too tightly coupled because I can tell Junie to fix or replace the tests if I run into trouble. For me the key things are:  (1) understanding from a project management perspective how to cut out little tasks and questions,  (2) understanding enough coding to know if it is on the right track (my non-technical boss has tried vibe coding and gets nowhere),  (3) accepting that it works sometimes and sometimes it doesn't,  and (4) recognizing context poisoning -- sometimes you ask it to do something and it gets it 95% right and you can tell it to fix the last bit and it is golden,  other times it argues or goes in circles or introduces bugs faster than it fixes them and as quickly as you can you recognize that is going on and start a new session and mix up your approach. reply",

          "text": "Yeah,  I thought about this in that case.  I tend to think the way you do to the extent that it is sometimes a source of conflict with other people I work with. These navbars are similar but not the same,  both have a pager but they have other things,  like one has some drop downs and the other has a text input.  Styled \"the same\" means the line around the search box looks the same as the lines around the numbers in the pager,  and Junie got that immediately. In the end the patch touched css classes in three lines of one file and added a css rule -- it had the caveat that one of the css classes involved will probably go away when the board finally agrees to make a visual change we've been talking about for most of a year but I left a comment in the first navbar warning about that. There are plenty of times I ask Junie to try to consolidate multiple components or classes into one and it does that too as directed. reply",

          "text": "I know of many experienced and capable engineers working on complex stuff who are driving basically all their development through agents. This includes production level work. This is the norm now in the SV startup world at least. You don't just YOLO it. You do extensive planning when features are complex, and you review output carefully. The thing is, if the agent isn't getting it to the point where you feel like you might need to drop down and edit manually, agents are now good enough to do those same \"manual edits\" with nearly 100% reliability if you are specific enough about what you want to do. Instead of \"build me x, y, z\", you can tell it to rename variables, restructure functions, write specific tests, move files around, and so on. So the question isn't so much whether to use an agent or edit code manually—it's what level of detail you work at with the agent. There are still times where it's easier to do things manually, but you never really need to. reply",

You add features when multiple stakeholders agree they are needed, not when one new guy shows up in a meeting. You listen deeply to them all and understand why they are asking for things, and devise a solutions that solves their underlying problem - do not just take their requests at face value and implement them. Then you get to surprise them in UAT, when instead of them telling you that you failed to solve their problems, they tell you: \"Wow, not what we asked for, but this is even better than what we had thought of.\" It is your job to be the expert in what the customers and stakeholders need, so take all those pain points and embrace them as opportunities to learn more deeply what the correct product to build actually is. It is also your job to set the priority, so there is no situation where everything is priority #1.

It’s up to the client to know what they want and up to you to build it. Time spent fantasizing out loud isn’t productive. Build a prototype, and bill them for the time. If it’s not what they want they can either build their own prototype or refine their guidance. Either way it’s time they are paying for just the same. As for scope creep you can handle that one of two ways: 1. Add a change annex to the current contract. This means you will complete the PWS of the base contract first and then bolt the change on at the end as a refactor. 2. Amend the current contract to include additional features. Don’t do this. In the end it’s all about the product work statement. You should think about goal completion only in terms: business objectives (data/money), visual/vanity, regulatory conformance, and extras. reply",

One comment stands out to me: > Whether to add it to the formal guidelines ( https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html ) is a different question, of course. I'm reluctant to do that, partly because it arguably follows from what's there, partly because this is still a pretty fuzzy area that is rapidly evolving, and partly because the community is already handling this issue pretty well. I guess me raising this question is because it feels maybe slightly off that people can't really know about this unwritten rule until they break it or see someone else break it and people tell them why. It is true that the community seems to handle it with downvotes, but it might not be clear enough why something gets downvoted, people can't see the intent. And it also seems like an inefficient way of communicating community norms, by telling users about them once they've broken them. Being upfront with what rules and norms to follow, like the guidelines already do for most things, feels more honest and welcoming for others to join in on discussions. reply",

There's at least two problems with arbitrarily fleshing out the guidelines (\"promoting\" \"case law\" to \"statutes\", as it were): * First, the guidelines get too large, and then nobody reads them all, which makes the guideline document less useful. Better to keep the guidelines page reduced down to a core of things, especially if those things can be extrapolated to most of the rest of the rules you care about (or most of them plus a bunch of stuff that doesn't come up often enough to need space on that page). * Second, whatever you write in the guidelines, people will incline to lawyer and bicker about. Writing a guideline implies, at least for some people, that every word is carefully considered and that there's something final about the specific word choices in the guidelines. \"Technically correct is the best kind of correct\" for a lot of nerds like us. Perhaps \"generated comments\" is trending towards a point where it earns a spot in the official guidelines. It sure comes up a lot. The flip side though is that we leave a lot of \"enforcement\" of the guidelines up to the community, and we have a pretty big problem with commenters randomly accusing people of LLM-authoring things, even when they're clearly (because spelling errors and whatnot) human-authored. Anyways: like I said, this is pretty well-settled process on HN. I used to spend a lot of time pushing Dan to add things to the guidelines; ultimately, I think the approach they've landed on is better than the one you (and, once, I) favored. reply",

If it helps, you can think of it as saying more about possible disagreeing opinions than about the specific opinion expressed. \"This answer is right, and the people who disagree are 'objectively' wrong.\" It took me some time to catch on to this.

Ultimately, I put it because: - It was the most directly informative comment on the thread; - It had been downvoted (greyed out) to the very bottom of the thread; and - I wanted to express my support before making a fairly orthogonal comment without whiplashing everyone. The whiplashing concern is the problem I run into most generally. It can be hard to reply to someone with a somewhat related idea without making it seem like you're contradicting them, particularly if they're being dogpiled on with downvotes or comments.

People behave as if they believe AI results are authoritative, which they are not On the other hand, a ban could result in a technical violation in a conversation about AI responses where providing examples of those responses is entirely appropriate. I feel like we're having a larger conversation here, one where we are watching etiquette evolve in realtime. This is analogous to \"Should we ban people from wearing bluetooth headsets in the coffee shop?\" in the 00s: people are demonstrating a new behavior that is disrupting social norms but the actual violation is really that the person looks like a dork. To that end, I'd probably be more for public shaming, potentially a clear \"we aren't banning it but please don't be an AI goober and don't just regurgitate AI output\", more than I would support a ban. reply",

All questions are legitimate, but in this circumstance what reason is there to believe that they would find even more enjoyment from reducing the quality? It seems a lot like code. You can \"vibe code\" your way into an ungodly mess, but those who used to enjoy the craft of writing high quality code before LLMs arrived still seem to insist on high quality code even if an LLM is helping produce it now. It is highly likely that internet comments are no different. Those who value quality will continue to. Those who want garbage will produce it, AI or not. Much more likely is seeing the user base shift over time towards users that don't care about quality. Many a forum have seen that happen long before LLMs were a thing, and it is likely to happen to forums again in the future. But, the comments aren't written for you (except your own, of course) anyway, so... It is not rational to want to control what others are writing for themselves.

Now, discussions usually follow the sun, and when someone not speaking, say, Portuguese wants to join in, they usually use English (sometimes German or Dutch), and just join. We know it's not perfect but it works. Without the embedded translation? It absolutely wouldn't. I also used pretty heavily a telegram channel with similar setup, but it was even better, with transparent auto translation. reply",

Many are written by specialists in the area who carefully choose what to state and suggest, and very often follow the structure of a big \"thought\" that is further explained and explored. Few pop books that might meet my criteria are basically digests, but fact-based ones. It's interesting that \"Thinking, Fast and Slow\" is a middle ground in some sense. Daniel Kahneman is definitely from academia, and in my opinion, he wrote a digest of what he touched on during his career, which was also thought-provoking for me, but not on a big scale. Can you name some works by the mentioned authors that might be called thought-provoking digests of some area of expertise? reply",

Apparently, some users received emails earlier in the year when it was about to be taken down, but I didn't. There were quite a few images in my history that I would have liked to have saved.<p>Maybe worse is how much this lowers my trust in OpenAI even further than it already had been. Dall-E was not a small platform; it was a cultural phenomenon accessed by hundreds of millions of users. It's bewildering that OpenAI would so silently \"take it behind the shed.\"<p>I'm searching, and it doesn't seem as if there was even an HN post about the shutdown. So, it didn't even hit this place's radar. How many of you are hearing this for the first time?<p>I don't understand how a company like OpenAI could be so reckless with user data integrity and access, particularly when sunsetting a product. All of the big-dog tech platforms have fairly robust protocols for notifying users and allowing them to download their data (even with hoops to jump through). How can they hope to be one while still acting like a \"move fast and break things\" startup? I <i>liked</i> the thing they broke.</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Not read this year but: 1. Sebastian Junger - Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging I read it some years ago but I remember it being a good read - for men. It also mentions how older societies handled post-war PTSD. So it got stuck in my head, despite only reading it once. Author was also a guest on Joe Rogan few times. 2. Christian and Barbara Joy O'Brien - The Genius of The Few (get it from goldenageproject.org.uk, not amazon) Great addition for anyone interested in Anunnaki and Sitchin's work. This takes a different angle but comes to the same/similar conclusions as Sitchin in more straightforward and less bombastic way as the authors were strictly fact-driven and held off any personal opinions or anything they could not prove. And I find that this is the only work not written by armchair warriors, second to Sitchin. I have no time yet but want to buy Schopenhauer's works. So it might be of interest to some as well. reply",

People tend to hyperfocus on the Nazis due to a morbid fascination with bodycounts, but the GDR was closer in time in both history and comopositions. They had faxes, computers, and many other technologies that made them similar to us, and I worry we forget the lessons of that regime. I read his book during a middle school in school suspension and it was a formative read.
