At a high level, Google does not have a product culture, so there is a lot of white space for companies like ours to make adopting Google Cloud APIs much easier for less technical users. It's also wild how much Agentic AI is creeping into all of our conversations - this space is constantly evolving as we're building. reply",

They can order their hot chocolate and their coffee as if they were going to grab something at a fancy café downtown, but instead it's at home and I'm the barista. It is quite nice to have for when my wife comes back from work and want something specific, or when we are waiting for the visit of a few friend, they can order exactly the available beverages and everything is ready when they're here. It was also a good playground for me to implement Web Push notifications (to never miss new orders). It's a basic Nuxt 3 app with Appwrite as the backend with rough edges, but much enough for our household use ! If you want to spam my phone with notifications, please visit my café : https://mytinycafe.com/alix reply",

          "text": "https://meetlace.ai - LACE, a self-organising research companion for long-horizon inquiry. With LLMs, generating ideas and snippets is cheap; what’s hard is keeping track of fragments with their “why I cared” context over months. Most tools (Notion/Obsidian/etc.) assume you will do the work (folder/tag/linking) structure  will maintain it forever. I don’t. In LACE we:\n– capture fragments from the web via a browser extension\n– auto-cluster them into evolving “threads” / projects with summaries & reading lists\n– maintain a graph of connections across threads (“topology of attention”)\n– let you turn a cluster of fragments into an essay draft when you’re ready to share. Stack is a fairly standard web app + LLM pipeline. Used neo4j's llm-graph-builder as a starting point. The interesting bit is self-organising graph. treating fragments/questions/lines of inquiry as first-class objects and letting the system reorganise around them over time instead of fixed folders. It’s in a small test phase right now. If you’re a researcher/writer/engineer/founder who constantly loses good ideas in your notes and want to try something opinionated in this space, I’d love feedback. background write-up: https://open.substack.com/pub/ozthinks/p/from-fragments-to-i... reply",

UI is very nice and simple, one tiny bit of feedback is that a 'guidelines' page would be worthwhile, especially while it's new! I thought I'd post my own project on the site - sometimes that's a little bit of a no-no though, and I couldn't find any guidelines to steer me towards what types of things to share, etc. Edit: Tiny extra feedback, is upvoting something immediately changes the rankings in the browser. It's pretty impressive speedwise, but especially if you're a couple pages in, you can bump something off of the page you're on which makes it a little weird to do something like 'upvote article and then check the comments'. reply",

I've updated a port of WxWidgets and now I support all the features KiCad needs with ~200 tests. Right now I have a build that loads in the browser, but I really want to have \"multithreading\" which means workers in the web. One can use asyncify with emscripten to translate blocking C++ to WASM, but that transition is not perfect, right now I'm debugging a bug where there's a race condition that halts all execution and the main thread runs in an infinite loop waiting for the workers to stand up. I guess I'll have a few of those ahead. The main goal is to 1. just have fun 2. use yjs as a collab backend so multiple people can edit the same PCB. This will probably work with pcbnew, KiCad's layout editor, since it has a plugin system and AFAIK I can do the sync layer there. For the rest ( schematic, component editor etc. ) I'll have to figure out something..\nKiCad does not sync automatically if you modify a file, I'll have to do some lifting there. Anyway, it's a lot of fun, I really want this thing to exist, I'm hoping that I won't run into a \"wellll, this is just not going to work\" kind of issue in the end. reply",

We just won silver at the Big Indie Pitch competition as well! - Currently in free Early Access with 18 competitive mini-games. - Players use their mobile phones as controllers (you can use game pads as well!) - Everything is completely web-based, no downloads or installs are necessary to play - All games support up to 8 players at a time and are action based, with quick ~one minute rounds to keep a good pace. This means there are no language based trivia or asynchronous games! - In the future we plan to open up the platform for 3rd party developers (and Gamejams!) as well. We take care of the network connectivity, controllers etc.. 3rd party devs can focus on developing cool multiplayer mini-games without spending an eternity with networking code and building the infrastructure.

          "text": "On the subject of whisper being great... A few weeks ago a co-worker commented about the difficulty he'd had editing a work demo, I pointed at various jump-cutting tools that had automated what he did in the past (editing out silences). But I'd also wanted to play with whisper for a while... So a couple of hours later I'd written a script that does transcription based editing: on the first pass it grabs a timestamped transcript and a plain text transcript for editing; you edit the words into any order you like and a second pass reassembles the video (it's just a couple of hundred lines of python wrapping whisper and ffmpeg). It also speeds up 4x any silences detected that sit within retained sequences in the video. Matching up transcripts turns out to be not that hard; I normalise the text, split it, and then compare to the sequence of normalised words from the timestamped transcript. I find the longest common sequence, keep that, then recurse on the before/after sections (there's a little more detail, but not much). I also sent the transcription to ffmpeg to burn in as captions, because sometimes it makes the audio choppy and the captions make it easier to follow. I know, tools have been doing this for years now. I just didn't have one to hand, and now I do, and I couldn't have done this without whisper. reply",

Paul Graham’s idea that essays are a way to learn really resonates with me. But I rarely publish anything beyond occasional LinkedIn posts.<p>My blockers:<p>•“Nobody needs this” / “It’s not original”<p>•“AI can explain most topics better than I can”<p>•A bit of fear: shipping something that feels naive or low-signal<p>At the same time, I read a lot of personal blogs + LinkedIn and I do get real value from them — mostly from perspective, lived experience, and clear thinking, not novelty.<p>For those of you who blog (or used to):<p>•What made it worth it for you?<p>•What kinds of posts actually worked (for learning, career, network, opportunities)?<p>•Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)?<p>•If you were starting today, what would you do differently?<p>I’m not trying to build a media business — more like building a “public notebook” that compounds over years.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

And making it public also inspires me to spend a bit more time thinking about it and double-checking some things before putting it out there. Sometimes I get a nice comment on a years-old blog post and that's also rewarding. Additionally, sometimes I search for something and have my own years-old blog post come up, reminding me that I already solved that thing before and can reuse the solution. * All posts have worked to consolidate knowledge and help me think. * Since you're just trying to build a public notebook, what are you trying to lower the bar to? Your own writing motivation or something else? If the former, just write to the length/cadence/themes you're interested in and don't write what you're not interested in. * Maybe I'd go back and tell pretty-much-teenage-me to stop being so cringe because this stuff will still be there 20 years later. reply",

Above all, it's accessible to everyone, not just those on a specific platform. I've had a blog for almost 20 years. Nowadays, it's the best record I have of what I'm interested in and working on. It has recipes I send to my friends, context for strangers. It's a beacon that attracts similar people, a call for them to reach out. And it works! I get emails about my posts. I helped people travel along the same routes, and fixed people's technical issues. Another blog of mine turned into a lifestyle business. I have met countless friends and two lovers through it. So yeah, do your thing, put it online. Start simple, migrate as needed. I love static sites because they're low maintenance. Hugo and a theme would be good. reply",

You say you're not trying to build a media business, and want to build a \"public notebook\", but you imply you're looking for career/networking opportunities. You're also not clear if the \"learning\" is for you as the author, or for the reader. If you want to have your content discovered online, I'd say you might be in for some trouble, although I don't think AI is the cause, only an accelerator on that. Blogs for readers learning are probably in decline, you're unlikely to get any outreach based on your posts for networking. However if, like me, the writing process is the point – you're trying to clarify your thoughts, learn something new yourself, or have a document you can share with colleagues when they ask you to explain your opinions, I think blogging is valuable. While you won't get direct outreach, you can share it on your CV or send it to recruiters and you might get noticed when applying for jobs. reply",

Too many to list such as jobs, recognition in the community, but the best ones are some sort of a personal satisfaction without the need to say anything aloud. The other two things I will always remember are (i) my cousin once accompanied me to a conference where I spoke, and after seeing the people lined/gathered around to talk, “What the heck are you, what do you do!” and (ii) recently, my daughter, “Papa, I searched you on Google and you are kinda Internet-famous, you are everything if I search your name.” > What kinds of posts actually worked (for learning, career, network, opportunities)? Two ways to look at it, (i) I don't care, I will just write or (ii) focus on a topic/community/vertical and keep writing about it, even if someone has written about it, write your own opinion.\nWatch for topic upticks in that vertical/interest and write about it, even if it means adding something to the ones that is already written. @simonw does it best https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/ > Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)?

I didn't do that for the first ~20 years - I offered just an RSS feed - but when I added the Substack newsletter option it become clear I should have been gathering email addresses from a lot earlier on! Despite having a substantial audience visiting my site now I still think the best way to get traffic to an article is to tell people about it elsewhere. I follow the POSSE principle: publish on own site, syndicate elsewhere: https://indieweb.org/POSSE Honestly though quality is much more important than quantity.

Also, you have hands-on experience, which is also demonstrably more than any \"AI\" has. I urge you to ignore this kind of doubt or consideration. - What kinds of posts actually worked (for learning, career, network, opportunities)? For learning, \"book report\" type posts, just to solidify what I've read in my mind, maybe drive a little experimentation to ensure I've concluded correctly. I've decided not to collect any metrics so that I don't follow from behind, so that I don't end up doing clickbait. Career and network opportunities have not arisen from my blog. My \"public notebook\" posts get more traffic, and I've referred back to them, but for me, these are mostly Linux sysadmin topics. I'd wager these are most valuable to people that find them for very specific problems, like seeing LLDP info from inside a WiFi access point or fixing GRUB problems on particular hardware. - Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)? I have not discovered anything for this, alas. I use Hugo, I have a couple of little shell scripts to do monthly counts of finished vs draft articles. I try to stay at or above 5 posts a month. I'm not sure that helps lower the bar, which I interpret as \"provide motivation to post\". What would I do differently? Start a blog years before I actually did so.

          "text": "Hey, just wanted to let you know that your honeypot data for PHP-based attacks ended up factoring in charges being dropped in two criminal cases where prosecution attempted to run with a harebrained and ludicrous theory that basically centered around some... mythical idea of how these attacks happen and how specific they can be. The criminal justice system is where lurid fantasies of how tech works end up putting people in prison for sometimes years and budget concerns meant that attorneys filled parking meters every 4 hours and we had two full time investigators in an office of 40, most with a 80-120 caseload (rolling basis). Sometimes the data one puts online can really make an impact that my guess is that it was entirely unexpected and for two people in their 20s with young kids (separate cases, in fact, although not too far apart), it really reclaimed a good chunk of their lives. Thank you for that, and I hope others would do the same, because one never knows when it'll come in handy. So many products sold to LE are basically snake oil and without data and facts, the threat is incredibly coercive. Any leverage for defense helps balancing the playing field and frankly, nobody deserves to be taken to trial based on utter BS that has merit merely because it matches the equally unfounded anxieties of people, however unsubstantiated.Thanks again! reply",

Re blockers: - Novelty: I routinely search for very niche, \"boring\" information, and am disappointed by how few in-depth blogposts I find. - “AI can explain most topics better than I can”. I doubt it!  I rarely find current AI as valuable as a good blog post. It tends to be shallow and regress to the mean, and b/c of hallucinations it's untrustworthy, so a lot of time is wasted fact-checking. - Fear of shipping: if it isn't relevant, nobody will read it (unless you're already famous) Re questions: - What made it worth it for you? Clarifying my thoughts, connecting with strangers who think about the same things, the leverage \"having a platform\" produces (it opens a lot of doors), and gaining prestige in certain niches. - What kinds of posts actually worked (for learning, career, network, opportunities)? I don't think this is simple to answer until the heat death of the universe. Traffic stats is a very poor estimator of value delivered. Which posts I am most proud of, and how much traffic they got, are weakly correlated. - Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)? Things that you are obsessed with. It's a tonne of work writing a good post, and sometimes you publish it and nobody cares, so it has to be intrinsically rewarding. - If you were starting today, what would you do differently? I don't know! Probably put less effort into trying to appear intelligent/impressive, which rarely works anyway. These are my off-the-top thoughts based on over a decade of blogging. reply",

          "text": "Writing is difficult and like all art forms, it’s subject to impostor syndrome. Blogging is the best way I have found to remind yourself that you’re not an impostor. And the more experience you get proving you’re not an impostor, the easier impostor syndrome is to deal with. Realistically if you start now, you’re years away from a devoted readership and that’s fine. You’ll gain from publishing and if you’re diligent, you’ll gain from watching your writing improve. For me, I like writing and can’t get paid enough in publishing or as a writer to do it professionally. So it’s worth it for me because I have a lot of fun writing. I spent a good part of my life hunting for eyeballs and now I’m content just writing whether anyone reads it or not. I’m not sure that I’d recommend any particular theme, cadence or style for a new blogger. And I definitely wouldn’t recommend a style of post. Rather those sorts of things will come organically as you get used to writing and start building a community. When you’re getting started, just focus on writing, trying to build habits and learning how to edit yourself. Most writers will struggle with one of the three on their way to developing a voice so if you’re going through hell you’re likely on the right path. If I were starting today, I’d focus less on hunting eyeballs and more on writing for the joy of it. I’d also spend a lot more time writing about subjects that I’m not interested in because that’s really good practice. And finally, I wouldn’t worry so much about writer’s block - it happens, it sucks but it goes away when you stop worrying about it. On the subject of writer’s block, if it’s something you struggle with I have a great exercise for you. When you’re stuck, interview yourself about the finished piece you’re stuck on. Pretend it’s done and interview yourself. I would have started doing that twenty five years ago and I’d be a far better writer now because of it. Finally, keep everything you write and read it regularly but there’s nothing wrong with pruning your blog regularly. If things you wrote two years ago are embarrassing today that means you’re a better writer. Go with that. reply",

Force yourself to exercise every day, because that's good for your physical health, but is blogging good for your health? Writing in public is performance art. Some people are naturally performance artists and need to perform to satisfy some internal urge. If you're not one of them, don't let anyone else convince you that you need to be one. It's ok to not blog. The idea that everyone should have a blog is completely unjustified. I read another comment that said you should write blog posts at least once a week.

I haven't found a real way to solve these issues 100%, but it occurred to me that the odds of me having these problems would be lower if I paywalled my stuff or at least required registration for access.

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I've been working on a personal project recently, rewriting an old jQuery + Django project into SvelteKit. The main work is translating the UI templates into idiomatic SvelteKit while maintaining the original styling. This includes things like using semantic HTML instead of div-spamming, not wrapping divs in divs in divs, and replacing bootstrap with minimal tailwind. It also includes some logic refactors, to maintain the original functionality but rewritten to avoid years of code debt. Things like replacing templates using boolean flags for multiple views with composable Svelte components.<p>I've had a fairly steady process for doing this: look at each route defined in Django, build out my `+page.server.ts`, and then split each major section of the page into a Svelte component with a matching Storybook story. It takes a lot of time to do this, since I have to ensure I'm not just copying the template but rather recreating it in a more idiomatic style.<p>This kind of work seems like a great use case for AI assisted programming, but I've failed to use it effectively. At most, I can only get Claude Code to recreate some slightly less spaghetti code in Svelte. Simple prompting just isn't able to get AI's code quality within 90% of what I'd write by hand. Ideally, AI could get it's code to something I could review manually in 15-20 minutes, which would massively speed up the time spent on this project (right now it takes me 1-2 hours to properly translate a route).<p>Do you guys have tips or suggestions on how to improve my efficiency and code quality with AI?</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Hey, Boris from the Claude Code team here. A few tips: 1. If there is anything Claude tends to repeatedly get wrong, not understand, or spend lots of tokens on, put it in your CLAUDE.md. Claude automatically reads this file and it’s a great way to avoid repeating yourself. I add to my team’s CLAUDE.md multiple times a week. 2. Use Plan mode (press shift-tab 2x). Go back and forth with Claude until you like the plan before you let Claude execute. This easily 2-3x’s results for harder tasks. 3. Give the model a way to check its work. For svelte, consider using the Puppeteer MCP server and tell Claude to check its work in the browser. This is another 2-3x. 4. Use Opus 4.5. It’s a step change from Sonnet 4.5 and earlier models. Hope that helps! reply",

The LLM context collapse happens well before you hit the token limits, and things like ground rules and whatnot stop influencing the LLMs outputs after a couple tens of thousands of tokens in my experience.

You need a feedback loop (we all do). and the best way is for it to change things and see the effects (ideally also against a good baseline like a test suite where it can roughly guage how close or far it is from the goal.) For assembly, a debugger/tracer works great (using batch-mode or scripts as models/tooling often choke on such interactivie TUI io). - If it keeps missing the mark tell it to decorate the code with a file log recording all the info it needs to understand what's happening. Its analysis of such logs normally zeroes the solution pretty quickly, especially for complex tasks. - If it's really struggling, tell it to sketch out a full plan in pseudocode, and explain why that will work, and analyze for any gotchas. Then to analayze the differences between the current implementation and the ideal it just worked out. This often helps get it unblocked. reply",

I was previously using it repeatedly in sessions (and was getting great results). The most recent major release introduced this bug where it keeps referring back to the first plan you made in a session even when you're planning something else ( https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/12505 ). I find this bug incredibly confusing. Am I using Plan Mode in a really strange way? Because for me this is a showstopper bug–my core workflow is broken.

Using slash commands and skills for workflows that are repeatable is a really nice way to keep your rules file from exploding. I have slash commands for code review, and git commit management. I have skills for complex tool interactions. Our company has it's own deployment CLI tool so using skills to make Claude Code an expert at using this tool has done wonders to improve Claude Codes performance when working on CI/CD problems. I am currently working on a new slash command /investigate <service> that runs triage for an active or past incident. I've had Claude write tools to interact with all of our partner services (AWS, JIRA, CI/CD pipelines, GitLab, Datadog) and now when an incident occurs it can quickly put together an early analysis of a incident finding the right people to involve (not just owners but people who last touched the service), potential root causes including service dependency investigations. I am putting this through it's paces now but early results are VERY good! reply",

I have a custom 'code style' system prompt that I want claude to use, and I have been able to add it when using claude in browser - ```\nBeautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit.\nSimple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated.\nReadability counts.\nSpecial cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity.\nIf the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. Trust the context you're given. Don't defend against problems the human didn't ask you to solve.\n``` How can I add it as a system prompt (or if its called something else) in vscode so LLMs adhere to it? reply",

Heck, why isn't there a cornucopia of new apps, even trivial ones? Where is all the shovelware [0]? Previous HN discussion here [1]. Don't get me wrong, AI is at least as game-changing for programming as StackOverflow and Google were back in the day. I use it every day, and it's saved me hours of work for certain specific tasks [2]. But it's simply not a massive 10x force multiplier that some might lead you to believe. I'll start believing when maintainers of complex, actively developed, and widely used open-source projects (e.g. ffmpeg, curl, openssh, sqlite) start raving about a massive uptick in positive contributions, pointing to a concrete influx of high-quality AI-assisted commits.

          "text": "\"Heck, why isn't there a cornucopia of new apps, even trivial ones?\" There is. We had to basically create a new category for them on /r/golang because there was a quite distinct step change near the beginning of this year where suddenly over half the posts to the subreddit were \"I asked my AI to put something together, here's a repo with 4 commits, 3000 lines of code, and an AI-generated README.md. It compiles and I may have even used it once or twice.\" It toned down a bit but it's still half-a-dozen posts a day like that on average. Some of them are at least useful in principle. Some of them are the same sorts of things you'd see twice a month, only now we can see them twice a week if not twice a day. The problem wasn't necessarily the utility or the lack thereof, it was simply the flood of them. It completely disturbed the balance of the subreddit. To the extent that you haven't heard about these, I'd observe that the world already had more apps than you could possibly have ever heard about and the bottleneck was already marketing rather than production. AIs have presumably not successfully done much about helping people market their creations. reply",

I know what you mean, but the thing I find windsurf (which we moved to from copilot) most useful (except writing opeanapi spec files) is asking it questions about the codebase. Just random minutiae that I could find by grepping or following the code, but would take me more than the 30s-1m it takes it. For reference, this is a monorepo of a bit over 1M LoC (and 800k YAML files, because, did I mention I hate API specs?), so not really a small code base either. > I will break down the tasks to the same size as if I was implementing it. But instead of doing it myself, I roughly describe the task on a technical level (and add relevant classes to the context) and it will ask me clarifying questions. After 2-3 rounds the plan usually looks good and I let it implement the task. Here I disagree, sort of. I almost never ask it to do complex tasks, the most time consuming and hardest part is not actually typing out the code, describing it to an AI takes me almost as much time as implementing for most things. One thing I did find very useful is the supertab feature of windsurf, which, at a high level, looks at the changes you started making and starts suggesting the next change. And it's not only limited to repetitive things (like . in vi), if you start adding a parameter to a function, it starts adding it to the docs, to the functions you need below, and starts implementing it. > For me this method allows me to focus on the architecture and overall structure and delegate the plumbing to Copilot.

As an example, one task of the feature was to add metrics for observability when the new action was executed. Another when it failed. My prompt: Create a new metric \"foo.bar\" in MyMetrics when MyService.action was successful and \"foo.bar.failed\" when it failed. I review the plan and let it implement it. As you can see it's a small task and after it is done I review the changes and commit them. Rinse and repeat. I think the biggest issue is that people try to one shot big features or applications.

For instance I had two navigation bars in an application which had different styling and I told it make the second one look like the first and...  it made a really nice patch.  Also if I don't understand how to use some open source dependency I check the project out and ask Junie questions about it like \"How do I do X?\" or \"How does setting prop Y have the effect of Z?\" and frequently I get the right answer right away.  Sometimes I describe a bug in my code and ask if it can figure it out and often it does, ask for a fix and often get great results. I have a React application where the testing situation is FUBAR, we are stuck on an old version of React where tests like enzyme that really run react are unworkable because the test framework can never know that React is done rendering -- working with Junie I developed a style of true unit tests for class components (still got 'em) that tests tricky methods in isolation. I have a test file which is well documented explaining the situation around tests and ask \"Can we make some tests for A like the tests in B.test.js, how would you do that?\" and if I like the plan I say \"make it so!\" and it does... frankly I would not be writing tests if I didn't have that help. It would also be possible to mock useState() and company and might do that someday... It doesn't bother me so much that the tests are too tightly coupled because I can tell Junie to fix or replace the tests if I run into trouble. For me the key things are:  (1) understanding from a project management perspective how to cut out little tasks and questions,  (2) understanding enough coding to know if it is on the right track (my non-technical boss has tried vibe coding and gets nowhere),  (3) accepting that it works sometimes and sometimes it doesn't,  and (4) recognizing context poisoning -- sometimes you ask it to do something and it gets it 95% right and you can tell it to fix the last bit and it is golden,  other times it argues or goes in circles or introduces bugs faster than it fixes them and as quickly as you can you recognize that is going on and start a new session and mix up your approach. reply",

          "text": "Yeah,  I thought about this in that case.  I tend to think the way you do to the extent that it is sometimes a source of conflict with other people I work with. These navbars are similar but not the same,  both have a pager but they have other things,  like one has some drop downs and the other has a text input.  Styled \"the same\" means the line around the search box looks the same as the lines around the numbers in the pager,  and Junie got that immediately. In the end the patch touched css classes in three lines of one file and added a css rule -- it had the caveat that one of the css classes involved will probably go away when the board finally agrees to make a visual change we've been talking about for most of a year but I left a comment in the first navbar warning about that. There are plenty of times I ask Junie to try to consolidate multiple components or classes into one and it does that too as directed. reply",

          "text": "I know of many experienced and capable engineers working on complex stuff who are driving basically all their development through agents. This includes production level work. This is the norm now in the SV startup world at least. You don't just YOLO it. You do extensive planning when features are complex, and you review output carefully. The thing is, if the agent isn't getting it to the point where you feel like you might need to drop down and edit manually, agents are now good enough to do those same \"manual edits\" with nearly 100% reliability if you are specific enough about what you want to do. Instead of \"build me x, y, z\", you can tell it to rename variables, restructure functions, write specific tests, move files around, and so on. So the question isn't so much whether to use an agent or edit code manually—it's what level of detail you work at with the agent. There are still times where it's easier to do things manually, but you never really need to. reply",

You add features when multiple stakeholders agree they are needed, not when one new guy shows up in a meeting. You listen deeply to them all and understand why they are asking for things, and devise a solutions that solves their underlying problem - do not just take their requests at face value and implement them. Then you get to surprise them in UAT, when instead of them telling you that you failed to solve their problems, they tell you: \"Wow, not what we asked for, but this is even better than what we had thought of.\" It is your job to be the expert in what the customers and stakeholders need, so take all those pain points and embrace them as opportunities to learn more deeply what the correct product to build actually is. It is also your job to set the priority, so there is no situation where everything is priority #1.

It’s up to the client to know what they want and up to you to build it. Time spent fantasizing out loud isn’t productive. Build a prototype, and bill them for the time. If it’s not what they want they can either build their own prototype or refine their guidance. Either way it’s time they are paying for just the same. As for scope creep you can handle that one of two ways: 1. Add a change annex to the current contract. This means you will complete the PWS of the base contract first and then bolt the change on at the end as a refactor. 2. Amend the current contract to include additional features. Don’t do this. In the end it’s all about the product work statement. You should think about goal completion only in terms: business objectives (data/money), visual/vanity, regulatory conformance, and extras. reply",

One comment stands out to me: > Whether to add it to the formal guidelines ( https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html ) is a different question, of course. I'm reluctant to do that, partly because it arguably follows from what's there, partly because this is still a pretty fuzzy area that is rapidly evolving, and partly because the community is already handling this issue pretty well. I guess me raising this question is because it feels maybe slightly off that people can't really know about this unwritten rule until they break it or see someone else break it and people tell them why. It is true that the community seems to handle it with downvotes, but it might not be clear enough why something gets downvoted, people can't see the intent. And it also seems like an inefficient way of communicating community norms, by telling users about them once they've broken them. Being upfront with what rules and norms to follow, like the guidelines already do for most things, feels more honest and welcoming for others to join in on discussions. reply",

There's at least two problems with arbitrarily fleshing out the guidelines (\"promoting\" \"case law\" to \"statutes\", as it were): * First, the guidelines get too large, and then nobody reads them all, which makes the guideline document less useful. Better to keep the guidelines page reduced down to a core of things, especially if those things can be extrapolated to most of the rest of the rules you care about (or most of them plus a bunch of stuff that doesn't come up often enough to need space on that page). * Second, whatever you write in the guidelines, people will incline to lawyer and bicker about. Writing a guideline implies, at least for some people, that every word is carefully considered and that there's something final about the specific word choices in the guidelines. \"Technically correct is the best kind of correct\" for a lot of nerds like us. Perhaps \"generated comments\" is trending towards a point where it earns a spot in the official guidelines. It sure comes up a lot. The flip side though is that we leave a lot of \"enforcement\" of the guidelines up to the community, and we have a pretty big problem with commenters randomly accusing people of LLM-authoring things, even when they're clearly (because spelling errors and whatnot) human-authored. Anyways: like I said, this is pretty well-settled process on HN. I used to spend a lot of time pushing Dan to add things to the guidelines; ultimately, I think the approach they've landed on is better than the one you (and, once, I) favored. reply",

If it helps, you can think of it as saying more about possible disagreeing opinions than about the specific opinion expressed. \"This answer is right, and the people who disagree are 'objectively' wrong.\" It took me some time to catch on to this.

Ultimately, I put it because: - It was the most directly informative comment on the thread; - It had been downvoted (greyed out) to the very bottom of the thread; and - I wanted to express my support before making a fairly orthogonal comment without whiplashing everyone. The whiplashing concern is the problem I run into most generally. It can be hard to reply to someone with a somewhat related idea without making it seem like you're contradicting them, particularly if they're being dogpiled on with downvotes or comments.

People behave as if they believe AI results are authoritative, which they are not On the other hand, a ban could result in a technical violation in a conversation about AI responses where providing examples of those responses is entirely appropriate. I feel like we're having a larger conversation here, one where we are watching etiquette evolve in realtime. This is analogous to \"Should we ban people from wearing bluetooth headsets in the coffee shop?\" in the 00s: people are demonstrating a new behavior that is disrupting social norms but the actual violation is really that the person looks like a dork. To that end, I'd probably be more for public shaming, potentially a clear \"we aren't banning it but please don't be an AI goober and don't just regurgitate AI output\", more than I would support a ban. reply",

All questions are legitimate, but in this circumstance what reason is there to believe that they would find even more enjoyment from reducing the quality? It seems a lot like code. You can \"vibe code\" your way into an ungodly mess, but those who used to enjoy the craft of writing high quality code before LLMs arrived still seem to insist on high quality code even if an LLM is helping produce it now. It is highly likely that internet comments are no different. Those who value quality will continue to. Those who want garbage will produce it, AI or not. Much more likely is seeing the user base shift over time towards users that don't care about quality. Many a forum have seen that happen long before LLMs were a thing, and it is likely to happen to forums again in the future. But, the comments aren't written for you (except your own, of course) anyway, so... It is not rational to want to control what others are writing for themselves.

Now, discussions usually follow the sun, and when someone not speaking, say, Portuguese wants to join in, they usually use English (sometimes German or Dutch), and just join. We know it's not perfect but it works. Without the embedded translation? It absolutely wouldn't. I also used pretty heavily a telegram channel with similar setup, but it was even better, with transparent auto translation. reply",

Many are written by specialists in the area who carefully choose what to state and suggest, and very often follow the structure of a big \"thought\" that is further explained and explored. Few pop books that might meet my criteria are basically digests, but fact-based ones. It's interesting that \"Thinking, Fast and Slow\" is a middle ground in some sense. Daniel Kahneman is definitely from academia, and in my opinion, he wrote a digest of what he touched on during his career, which was also thought-provoking for me, but not on a big scale. Can you name some works by the mentioned authors that might be called thought-provoking digests of some area of expertise? reply",

Apparently, some users received emails earlier in the year when it was about to be taken down, but I didn't. There were quite a few images in my history that I would have liked to have saved.<p>Maybe worse is how much this lowers my trust in OpenAI even further than it already had been. Dall-E was not a small platform; it was a cultural phenomenon accessed by hundreds of millions of users. It's bewildering that OpenAI would so silently \"take it behind the shed.\"<p>I'm searching, and it doesn't seem as if there was even an HN post about the shutdown. So, it didn't even hit this place's radar. How many of you are hearing this for the first time?<p>I don't understand how a company like OpenAI could be so reckless with user data integrity and access, particularly when sunsetting a product. All of the big-dog tech platforms have fairly robust protocols for notifying users and allowing them to download their data (even with hoops to jump through). How can they hope to be one while still acting like a \"move fast and break things\" startup? I <i>liked</i> the thing they broke.</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Not read this year but: 1. Sebastian Junger - Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging I read it some years ago but I remember it being a good read - for men. It also mentions how older societies handled post-war PTSD. So it got stuck in my head, despite only reading it once. Author was also a guest on Joe Rogan few times. 2. Christian and Barbara Joy O'Brien - The Genius of The Few (get it from goldenageproject.org.uk, not amazon) Great addition for anyone interested in Anunnaki and Sitchin's work. This takes a different angle but comes to the same/similar conclusions as Sitchin in more straightforward and less bombastic way as the authors were strictly fact-driven and held off any personal opinions or anything they could not prove. And I find that this is the only work not written by armchair warriors, second to Sitchin. I have no time yet but want to buy Schopenhauer's works. So it might be of interest to some as well. reply",

People tend to hyperfocus on the Nazis due to a morbid fascination with bodycounts, but the GDR was closer in time in both history and comopositions. They had faxes, computers, and many other technologies that made them similar to us, and I worry we forget the lessons of that regime. I read his book during a middle school in school suspension and it was a formative read.

They can order their hot chocolate and their coffee as if they were going to grab something at a fancy café downtown, but instead it's at home and I'm the barista. It is quite nice to have for when my wife comes back from work and want something specific, or when we are waiting for the visit of a few friend, they can order exactly the available beverages and everything is ready when they're here. It was also a good playground for me to implement Web Push notifications (to never miss new orders). It's a basic Nuxt 3 app with Appwrite as the backend with rough edges, but much enough for our household use !

          "text": "I'm working on porting KiCad to the browser. It's a lot of sweat and tears, multithreading issues and some more sweat. I've updated a port of WxWidgets and now I support all the features KiCad needs with ~200 tests. Right now I have a build that loads in the browser, but I really want to have \"multithreading\" which means workers in the web. One can use asyncify with emscripten to translate blocking C++ to WASM, but that transition is not perfect, right now I'm debugging a bug where there's a race condition that halts all execution and the main thread runs in an infinite loop waiting for the workers to stand up. I guess I'll have a few of those ahead. The main goal is to 1. just have fun 2. use yjs as a collab backend so multiple people can edit the same PCB. This will probably work with pcbnew, KiCad's layout editor, since it has a plugin system and AFAIK I can do the sync layer there. For the rest ( schematic, component editor etc. ) I'll have to figure out something..\nKiCad does not sync automatically if you modify a file, I'll have to do some lifting there. Anyway, it's a lot of fun, I really want this thing to exist, I'm hoping that I won't run into a \"wellll, this is just not going to work\" kind of issue in the end. reply",

          "text": "On the subject of whisper being great... A few weeks ago a co-worker commented about the difficulty he'd had editing a work demo, I pointed at various jump-cutting tools that had automated what he did in the past (editing out silences). But I'd also wanted to play with whisper for a while... So a couple of hours later I'd written a script that does transcription based editing: on the first pass it grabs a timestamped transcript and a plain text transcript for editing; you edit the words into any order you like and a second pass reassembles the video (it's just a couple of hundred lines of python wrapping whisper and ffmpeg). It also speeds up 4x any silences detected that sit within retained sequences in the video. Matching up transcripts turns out to be not that hard; I normalise the text, split it, and then compare to the sequence of normalised words from the timestamped transcript. I find the longest common sequence, keep that, then recurse on the before/after sections (there's a little more detail, but not much). I also sent the transcription to ffmpeg to burn in as captions, because sometimes it makes the audio choppy and the captions make it easier to follow. I know, tools have been doing this for years now. I just didn't have one to hand, and now I do, and I couldn't have done this without whisper. reply",

          "text": "As someone who spent 2+ years building one, I would turn away now if you're looking for traction or sustainability ( https://couplingcafe.com ). Though I don't regret it and learned enough to speak to my in-laws. My retention numbers are decent, but I just haven't done the marketing bit yet, and am currently taking a break. Language learning apps are the ultimate sand-pit for solo developers thinking they can offer some random unique feature that Duolingo (or \"Anki but better\") doesn't offer. Without realizing, they don't do it for a reason. Language learning has extremely low activation and retention. And it's super easy to find one or two early adopters that like your app for some reason to keep going. And solo developers that get into language learning often are only strong in software development and lack in UX, design, product, or marketing. You may start with a calm, \"not Duolingo gamification\" style app, but every language learning app starts with pure intentions until you're many months or years in, your numbers are low, you need to make money, and you need to move the needle. My two cents, you don't have to heed it obviously. reply",

          "text": "I’ve been working on a product for a little while that Ivan Illich would call a “convivial tool,” one that doesn’t take from the user but makes them more effective, independent, and creative from its use.  I’ve been interested in these kinds of tools for a long time, but I feel some sense of urgency in the LLM era, where I’ve already seen peers lose their edge by offloading the cognitive work. I’ve been interested in these kinds of tools for a while, that actually act as a bicycle for the mind. Most apps forgo the metacognitive and emotional labor that actually helps people learn effectively in favor of gamification because 1. Modeling these skills is hard 2. The first step to building effective learning habits is to restore the so-called “learn drive” which is the love of learning, play, and tinkering that underlies most effective learning and gamification does so but on an artificial level. There is so much content out there, and a sufficiently motivated person will find it and make meaning out of it. Most people are not motivated and don’t know how to motivate, meander, explore without gritting teeth, and I think you’ll probably just see churn without gamification unless you deal with that side of the process. Since I've tried to ship such tools before and ultimately failed, I’m explicitly not doing the whole SV fail fast and iterate thing here: I’m meandering, taking my time, letting motivation move me when it strikes versus going for the easiest or most obvious thing. (also sorry if this is itself meandering: I’m lifting while typing this on my phone) reply",

          "text": "That approach might be at odds with the market, but I don't think it's at odds with learning. I strongly dislike duolingo - it's gamification kept me pre-occupied for a while without noticing that I wasn't making any progress learning the language. When I figured that out, I felt cheated by the app! A long time ago I used a beta app that was being built by a high school teacher that I really enjoyed. It basically had a bunch on YouTube videos with a few different type of exercises. Unfortunately I had a busy schedule and couldn't keep up and I don't think the app was successful. My day job is development in the education space. If you care about building a learning app, read up on learning theory / pedagogy. A concept I really like wrt language learning is \"comprehensible input\". Other things to consider with languages is that hearing native speakers is extremely important. ps. wrt to gamification - I wish that people took the parts of games that I do like when they gamify an experience - open worlds, exploration, story telling, low stakes, save points, fun! reply",

The best two apps right now IMHO are Reading.com and Mentava, and they take radically different approaches. Mentava is pretty gamified and kids can use it on its own, whereas Reading.com is basically a computer implementation of Siegfried Engelmann's instructional approach. Has to be used with a parent accompaniment, and most of the onscreen widgets are just there to facilitate co-teaching. Both apps are good and seem to be landing with their target markets, obviously the simpler one is aiming at a lower price point. Poor gamification is a bigger risk than non-gamification done well IMHO. That's where a lot of children's learning apps have failed in the past. reply",

          "text": "I’ve been building a type of an educational app for the last 6 months. Spent 6 months building the product. Now I’m focusing on marketing and branding. I’ve spent last few weeks studying other successful educational products. And so far, from my research,  pretty much every single one of these apps/sites prioritized making the user “feel good” about learning rather than actually learning. And unfortunately, this is what the users want. They want to feel good about learning. All the successful education sites employ these mechanisms that you’re intending to avoid. I wanted to avoid using these as well - but I  just don’t see another way. I’ve even had users explicitly ask me to add milestones, streaks, etc to motivate them. Reality is - most people who really want to study or learn anything, can do so without an app. Even a book from a library will do. But it requires tremendous consistency, effort and time. Apps are way easier and make the user feel good - there’s still learning being done, don’t get me wrong. But user feeling good about it is what keeps them coming back. Edit: I’ve also studied many of their ads. Often times on places like TikTok, Instagram, etc their ads are what I would call “intelligence porn”. They get you excited about being more intelligent, investing in yourself, intelligence eliticism, etc. These were a common ad strategy that I have discovered so far. Some apps literally ran ads with text: “become dangerously intelligent” text and had the song from the show Succession play with images of famous researchers and scientists changing quickly. (Newton, Einstein, etc). Stuff like this cracked me up tbh lol. But apparently it works reply",

Every time the word \"gamification\" comes up in a conversation (with users, customers, internet posts), it reminds me of the quote from the great Charlie Munger \"Show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome\". Basically, gamification is supposed to incentivize the learner but a majority of training/learnings are unfortunately mostly about \"checking a box\" especially when it comes to required/regulated trainings (I mostly work with customers in these areas). So if you are building a learning app where learning is forced on the learner by someone else (their boss, employer, parent etc), then gamification won't be of any real use. No one will care if they just unlocked some imaginary points. On the other hand, my kids love learning in apps like Duolingo where they are proud of the \"streak\" they have for continuous number of days. But here is the thing. No one asked them to learn this stuff. They got interested (by watching a friend etc) and now they are playing the same game. reply",

When they realise it was AOE cutscenes, and that the whole project was a backdoor to deliver historical knowledge to people. I feel like if you eschew gamification, your audience is largely only those with a deep interest of learning. I used an app to do a security cert a while back, and it would bug me 3 times a day, and challenge me to test my knowledge. I think it really helped keep my focus on the challenge. Likewise, when I was doing my CCNA years ago, the In-30-Days gentleman, would subscribe you to 30 days of motivational emails to read his book and practice the skills. Not an app, but the same sort of thing. Some people sell the motivation as the core product, some sell the game as the core product (to deliver motivation) and some people sell the knowledge as the core product. All are valid approaches just make sure you are happy with the market you are targeting. One more thing: I have absolutely no idea how to obtain calm in todays environment. I dont see myself engaging with an app that requires me to be calm ahead of time, but if it somehow strengthened or created a sense of calm that might be a sufficient product differentiator. reply",

This is cool, and I've auto-didacted a number of things with resources like this, and I know most here have as well. But, watching the interview with the Duolingo CEO linked in this thread, he's talking about reaching the far larger set of people that don't have strong intrinsic motivation to learn. Which is arguably a much more difficult and more important mission. The natural learners (and kids of white-collar parents) are already pretty well-equipped by the general state of the internet.

However, I do generally have a distaste for \"gamified\"  learning, and, separately, I feel distracted by things I feel are not very fulfilling, but are addicting (namely, scrolling through news, social media, or videos on my phone). I won't say what you are building is a mistake. But just based on what you described, if I were interested in learning a language through your app, I would not just be comparing it to other language learning apps, but I would also be comparing it to language textbooks/workbooks, classes at a community college or MOOC, or language courses on DVD/CD/YouTube/etc. I guess I think that apps are good at gamifying things, if that were to be a goal. If you are stripping that away, what makes your app unique compared to all those other resources? How does your app replace or supplement other things? And to be clear, I imagine there could be plenty of things that make your app unique! I just would want to know what those things are before diving in. reply",

          "text": "Hi - Mentava founder here (we make gamified early literacy software). Obviously I believe in the value of gamification, though I think it's difficult to do correctly. There's certainly a market for \"calm\" learning, though you've already identified the main challenge: there's a smaller larger market for people who want to be educated than entertained, and the market for \"calm education\" is going to be an even smaller subset of that education market. Essentially you're looking for the people who are saying \"I want to be educated, but I'm not looking for the most efficient way to do it. I would prefer to move at a slower pace being driven purely by intrinsic motivation, rather than using extrinsic motivators in order to encourage me to move more quickly\" That market certainly exists, but it's a small enough niche that you'll likely have to be compete at a high price point to be viable. As point of comparison, Mentava costs $500/month, so if I were building a calm learning app (for an even smaller market), I would try to figure out a way justify an even higher price point than Mentava's. reply",

It was no bullshit, no gamification, and no distraction. I used it for one or two months, 700 hours in total. I can attribute to it some progress in learning my target language. Then I went on vacation for a few weeks and completely forgot about it. Today I tried to find it again, but since I forgot its name, I couldn't find it easily. Normally, I would search my inbox, but there was not a single mail from it. When I found it, I learned it improved quite a bit and added a way to support the app through subscriptions. Now, if it had some promotions or gamification built-in, I would be reminded of its existence and would most probably have been using it at least 700 more hours until today, and maybe even subscribed to it. And it would bring me closer to reaching the learning goal in my target language. TL;DR: Yes, some gamification or nagging is necessary. But don't overdo it. [1] https://morpheem.org/ reply",

However, due to the more user-driven approach to this learning method (output-focused, user has to put in effort to chat with the AI and get feedback), there is more friction with using the tool. This isn't necessarily a bad thing - in fact, more friction can lead to more meaningful experiences. That being said, I believe the market will push tools to be low friction and low effort (i.e. gamified apps) that are focused on consumption rather than tools that require more user effort. just my 2c from a fellow builder. if curious, check it out here! would love any feedback https://koucai.chat reply",

          "text": "Think of your product as part \"content\" and part \"container\". When I say \"content\" I mean \"stuff that could fit on a content platform\". When I say \"container\" I mean, the bundle of forces that your product exerts to bring the user in contact with the content. Some learning products are just content with zero container. Books are the limit example. Karpathy's \"Let's build GPT\" is another. Most learning products -- and all apps -- live or die by the container they create. (There is no reason to build a learning app other than to build a container. If you feel you have the best content, ship it on a content platform and save yourself a very painful distribution slog. Duolingo is in the container game. Their container is made of every cheap trick in the book -- notifications, streaks, etc -- because they work. My startup was Hack Reactor, the coding bootcamp, and we did it with pair programming and fixed classroom hours. (We had great content, but our competitors with good containers and bad content did leagues better than vice versa.) If you're building an app, you're in the container game. You can build a great container with no cheap tricks. I have done so! But you can't build a great learning app with no container, and you can't build a great container if you if you don't want to change your users' patterns of engagement and attention. So, what is your container? How will you weave a powerful spell that meaningfully transforms the attention and engagement of the app's user? What will cause them to pull up your app again and again, when they would have churned from a simple anki deck or whatnot? Given that you find it distasteful to use the easy levers you mentioned (notifications, \"streak\" psychology), what alternatives can shift your users' patterns of attention and engagement towards the learning task? If you have great answers to those questions, great! If you don't want to build a container, build content on a platform with easy distribution. If you want to build a container but you don't want to shape your users' attention or engagement, you are confused. reply",

It is a powerful psychological trick. Can definitely be used for good. \nWorking on performance often feels amazing because we can profile, identify clear bottlenecks and work to reduce them. When you manage to make number go down, you have a clear indication something went right. Maybe you didn't absolutely improve de code, but you made it better in a very specific way under a very specific lens. People like it because of this aspect, and it does feel a little bit like a game. There is a clear requirement and a clear specification.

There is no incentive to make the user feel good, at all, without being pervasive. \nIf you care about your user, you should design around the user. Inevitably, you will think a bunch about what feels good. \nIf all you care about is the user learning, developing competence, you will offer no platform at all.

Among other things, dopamine is the learning hormone, it is a problem when it makes you learn the wrong things, like \"fentanyl is really great\", or \"I need to buy more stuff I don't need\", but it is also what helps you learn useful skills and life lessons. I remember my father, a teacher, who told me he viewed his job in the classroom as a performance art. His knowledge was secondary, if that's knowledge you want, just read a book, go to the internet, whatever, you don't need a teacher. But it is not very engaging, and a teacher's job is to make it more engaging. So without engagement, you probably won't make a good learning app, but you can make the engagement entirely targeted towards learning and not monetization, which would be a very good thing. reply",

But I rarely publish anything beyond occasional LinkedIn posts.<p>My blockers:<p>•“Nobody needs this” / “It’s not original”<p>•“AI can explain most topics better than I can”<p>•A bit of fear: shipping something that feels naive or low-signal<p>At the same time, I read a lot of personal blogs + LinkedIn and I do get real value from them — mostly from perspective, lived experience, and clear thinking, not novelty.<p>For those of you who blog (or used to):<p>•What made it worth it for you?<p>•What kinds of posts actually worked (for learning, career, network, opportunities)?<p>•Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)?<p>•If you were starting today, what would you do differently?<p>I’m not trying to build a media business — more like building a “public notebook” that compounds over years.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Above all, it's accessible to everyone, not just those on a specific platform. I've had a blog for almost 20 years. Nowadays, it's the best record I have of what I'm interested in and working on. It has recipes I send to my friends, context for strangers. It's a beacon that attracts similar people, a call for them to reach out. And it works! I get emails about my posts. I helped people travel along the same routes, and fixed people's technical issues. Another blog of mine turned into a lifestyle business. I have met countless friends and two lovers through it. So yeah, do your thing, put it online. Start simple, migrate as needed. I love static sites because they're low maintenance. Hugo and a theme would be good. reply",

You say you're not trying to build a media business, and want to build a \"public notebook\", but you imply you're looking for career/networking opportunities. You're also not clear if the \"learning\" is for you as the author, or for the reader. If you want to have your content discovered online, I'd say you might be in for some trouble, although I don't think AI is the cause, only an accelerator on that. Blogs for readers learning are probably in decline, you're unlikely to get any outreach based on your posts for networking. However if, like me, the writing process is the point – you're trying to clarify your thoughts, learn something new yourself, or have a document you can share with colleagues when they ask you to explain your opinions, I think blogging is valuable. While you won't get direct outreach, you can share it on your CV or send it to recruiters and you might get noticed when applying for jobs. reply",

None, probably less than 100 people have read it, I only share it in friend groups, but it feels nice when those friends read it and give me feedback. >Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)? What do you mean by \"lowers the bar\"? The length of my posts can be pretty variable, cadence is \"whenever\" and the blog can go months without an update, and themes are also pretty varied, sometimes I talk about some piece of fiction I like, other times it gets more technical, and sometimes too I just recount the process of making something and the insights it gave me. >If you were starting today, what would you do differently?

The posts that tend to compound aren’t “explainers.” They’re records of decisions, trade-offs, failures, and mental models you’ve actually tested. That’s where perspective comes from, and that’s the part AI can’t synthesize for you. If starting today, I’d optimize for low friction and long half-life: short notes, irregular cadence, one theme you’re actively working on. Treat it as a public lab notebook.

Usually just having some content for people to skim was enough, but folks would tend to mention nearly random articles depending on their interests. > Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)? - I'm not a great blogger in that I have no established cadence. I didn't want pressure to deliver crap (biweekly), nor did I want necessarily to put posts on too high of a pedestal (monthly+). > If you were starting today, what would you do differently? - Highly recommend going with simple tech.

Despite having a substantial audience visiting my site now I still think the best way to get traffic to an article is to tell people about it elsewhere.

Also, you have hands-on experience, which is also demonstrably more than any \"AI\" has. I urge you to ignore this kind of doubt or consideration. - What kinds of posts actually worked (for learning, career, network, opportunities)? For learning, \"book report\" type posts, just to solidify what I've read in my mind, maybe drive a little experimentation to ensure I've concluded correctly. I've decided not to collect any metrics so that I don't follow from behind, so that I don't end up doing clickbait. Career and network opportunities have not arisen from my blog. My \"public notebook\" posts get more traffic, and I've referred back to them, but for me, these are mostly Linux sysadmin topics. I'd wager these are most valuable to people that find them for very specific problems, like seeing LLDP info from inside a WiFi access point or fixing GRUB problems on particular hardware. - Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)? I have not discovered anything for this, alas. I use Hugo, I have a couple of little shell scripts to do monthly counts of finished vs draft articles. I try to stay at or above 5 posts a month. I'm not sure that helps lower the bar, which I interpret as \"provide motivation to post\". What would I do differently? Start a blog years before I actually did so.

The criminal justice system is where lurid fantasies of how tech works end up putting people in prison for sometimes years and budget concerns meant that attorneys filled parking meters every 4 hours and we had two full time investigators in an office of 40, most with a 80-120 caseload (rolling basis). Sometimes the data one puts online can really make an impact that my guess is that it was entirely unexpected and for two people in their 20s with young kids (separate cases, in fact, although not too far apart), it really reclaimed a good chunk of their lives. Thank you for that, and I hope others would do the same, because one never knows when it'll come in handy. So many products sold to LE are basically snake oil and without data and facts, the threat is incredibly coercive. Any leverage for defense helps balancing the playing field and frankly, nobody deserves to be taken to trial based on utter BS that has merit merely because it matches the equally unfounded anxieties of people, however unsubstantiated.Thanks again! reply",

          "text": "> What made it worth it for you? Too many to list such as jobs, recognition in the community, but the best ones are some sort of a personal satisfaction without the need to say anything aloud. The other two things I will always remember are (i) my cousin once accompanied me to a conference where I spoke, and after seeing the people lined/gathered around to talk, “What the heck are you, what do you do!” and (ii) recently, my daughter, “Papa, I searched you on Google and you are kinda Internet-famous, you are everything if I search your name.” > What kinds of posts actually worked (for learning, career, network, opportunities)? Two ways to look at it, (i) I don't care, I will just write or (ii) focus on a topic/community/vertical and keep writing about it, even if someone has written about it, write your own opinion.\nWatch for topic upticks in that vertical/interest and write about it, even if it means adding something to the ones that is already written. @simonw does it best https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/ > Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)? Make it open-ended. When you want and inspired, keep writing perhaps a long-form article or just stay short like @kepano https://stephango.com/style > If you were starting today, what would you do differently? Stay simple, minimal, comments optional/avoid. Separate content from your styles.

          "text": "I started blogging long before AI became mainstream, but I'd say: totally worth it. Re blockers: - Novelty: I routinely search for very niche, \"boring\" information, and am disappointed by how few in-depth blogposts I find. - “AI can explain most topics better than I can”. I doubt it!  I rarely find current AI as valuable as a good blog post. It tends to be shallow and regress to the mean, and b/c of hallucinations it's untrustworthy, so a lot of time is wasted fact-checking. - Fear of shipping: if it isn't relevant, nobody will read it (unless you're already famous) Re questions: - What made it worth it for you? Clarifying my thoughts, connecting with strangers who think about the same things, the leverage \"having a platform\" produces (it opens a lot of doors), and gaining prestige in certain niches. - What kinds of posts actually worked (for learning, career, network, opportunities)? I don't think this is simple to answer until the heat death of the universe. Traffic stats is a very poor estimator of value delivered. Which posts I am most proud of, and how much traffic they got, are weakly correlated. - Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)? Things that you are obsessed with. It's a tonne of work writing a good post, and sometimes you publish it and nobody cares, so it has to be intrinsically rewarding. - If you were starting today, what would you do differently? I don't know! Probably put less effort into trying to appear intelligent/impressive, which rarely works anyway. These are my off-the-top thoughts based on over a decade of blogging. reply",

Force yourself to exercise every day, because that's good for your physical health, but is blogging good for your health? Writing in public is performance art. Some people are naturally performance artists and need to perform to satisfy some internal urge. If you're not one of them, don't let anyone else convince you that you need to be one. It's ok to not blog. The idea that everyone should have a blog is completely unjustified. I read another comment that said you should write blog posts at least once a week.

          "text": "Writing is difficult and like all art forms, it’s subject to impostor syndrome. Blogging is the best way I have found to remind yourself that you’re not an impostor. And the more experience you get proving you’re not an impostor, the easier impostor syndrome is to deal with. Realistically if you start now, you’re years away from a devoted readership and that’s fine. You’ll gain from publishing and if you’re diligent, you’ll gain from watching your writing improve. For me, I like writing and can’t get paid enough in publishing or as a writer to do it professionally. So it’s worth it for me because I have a lot of fun writing. I spent a good part of my life hunting for eyeballs and now I’m content just writing whether anyone reads it or not. I’m not sure that I’d recommend any particular theme, cadence or style for a new blogger. And I definitely wouldn’t recommend a style of post. Rather those sorts of things will come organically as you get used to writing and start building a community. When you’re getting started, just focus on writing, trying to build habits and learning how to edit yourself. Most writers will struggle with one of the three on their way to developing a voice so if you’re going through hell you’re likely on the right path. If I were starting today, I’d focus less on hunting eyeballs and more on writing for the joy of it. I’d also spend a lot more time writing about subjects that I’m not interested in because that’s really good practice. And finally, I wouldn’t worry so much about writer’s block - it happens, it sucks but it goes away when you stop worrying about it. On the subject of writer’s block, if it’s something you struggle with I have a great exercise for you. When you’re stuck, interview yourself about the finished piece you’re stuck on. Pretend it’s done and interview yourself. I would have started doing that twenty five years ago and I’d be a far better writer now because of it. Finally, keep everything you write and read it regularly but there’s nothing wrong with pruning your blog regularly. If things you wrote two years ago are embarrassing today that means you’re a better writer. Go with that. reply",

Here's one of mine, where in 2018 I look back on predictions made in 2012. Some held up well, some, it turned out, were physically impossible : https://benwheatley.github.io/blog/2018/07/17-16.09.05.html Naïve errors: Optical-wavelength metamaterial cloaking, fabric or otherwise, is not possible, the bandwidth is too narrow; Robot cars may be technically available in many countries, but they're sure not \"rapidly displacing human drivers because they are much safer and therefore cheaper to insure\". Close but no cigar: Nameplate solar power didn't reach par with global electricity use in 2024, but it did get to 1865 TW, which would have been 82% of global electricity use at the time I made the prediction. Actual global electricity use is 50% higher today than in 2012.

I haven't found a real way to solve these issues 100%, but it occurred to me that the odds of me having these problems would be lower if I paywalled my stuff or at least required registration for access. Free registration would not work if everyone did it the same way, but perhaps there is a way to have your own system that no crawler would bother trying to interface with. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I've been working on a personal project recently, rewriting an old jQuery + Django project into SvelteKit. The main work is translating the UI templates into idiomatic SvelteKit while maintaining the original styling. This includes things like using semantic HTML instead of div-spamming, not wrapping divs in divs in divs, and replacing bootstrap with minimal tailwind. It also includes some logic refactors, to maintain the original functionality but rewritten to avoid years of code debt. Things like replacing templates using boolean flags for multiple views with composable Svelte components.<p>I've had a fairly steady process for doing this: look at each route defined in Django, build out my `+page.server.ts`, and then split each major section of the page into a Svelte component with a matching Storybook story. It takes a lot of time to do this, since I have to ensure I'm not just copying the template but rather recreating it in a more idiomatic style.<p>This kind of work seems like a great use case for AI assisted programming, but I've failed to use it effectively. At most, I can only get Claude Code to recreate some slightly less spaghetti code in Svelte. Simple prompting just isn't able to get AI's code quality within 90% of what I'd write by hand. Ideally, AI could get it's code to something I could review manually in 15-20 minutes, which would massively speed up the time spent on this project (right now it takes me 1-2 hours to properly translate a route).<p>Do you guys have tips or suggestions on how to improve my efficiency and code quality with AI?</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Hey, Boris from the Claude Code team here. A few tips: 1. If there is anything Claude tends to repeatedly get wrong, not understand, or spend lots of tokens on, put it in your CLAUDE.md. Claude automatically reads this file and it’s a great way to avoid repeating yourself. I add to my team’s CLAUDE.md multiple times a week. 2. Use Plan mode (press shift-tab 2x). Go back and forth with Claude until you like the plan before you let Claude execute. This easily 2-3x’s results for harder tasks. 3. Give the model a way to check its work. For svelte, consider using the Puppeteer MCP server and tell Claude to check its work in the browser. This is another 2-3x. 4. Use Opus 4.5. It’s a step change from Sonnet 4.5 and earlier models. Hope that helps! reply",

For longer projects, have the LLM write down a plan or checklist, and then have it tackle each step in a new conversation. The LLM context collapse happens well before you hit the token limits, and things like ground rules and whatnot stop influencing the LLMs outputs after a couple tens of thousands of tokens in my experience. (Similar guidance goes for writing tools & whatnot - give the LLM exactly and only what it needs back from a tool, don’t try to make it act like a deterministic program.

You need a feedback loop (we all do). and the best way is for it to change things and see the effects (ideally also against a good baseline like a test suite where it can roughly guage how close or far it is from the goal.) For assembly, a debugger/tracer works great (using batch-mode or scripts as models/tooling often choke on such interactivie TUI io). - If it keeps missing the mark tell it to decorate the code with a file log recording all the info it needs to understand what's happening. Its analysis of such logs normally zeroes the solution pretty quickly, especially for complex tasks. - If it's really struggling, tell it to sketch out a full plan in pseudocode, and explain why that will work, and analyze for any gotchas. Then to analayze the differences between the current implementation and the ideal it just worked out. This often helps get it unblocked. reply",

I was looking for similar functionality as Claude projects. But that's not available for Claude Code Web. So, I asked Claude what would be a way of achieving pretty the same as projects, and it told me to put all information I wanted to share in a file with the filename:.clinerules. Claude told me I should put that file in the root of my repository. So please help me, is your recommendation the correct way of doing this, or did Claude give the correct answer?

          "text": "Something to keep in mind is if your CLAUDE.md file is getting large, consider alternative approaches especially for repeatable tasks. Using slash commands and skills for workflows that are repeatable is a really nice way to keep your rules file from exploding. I have slash commands for code review, and git commit management. I have skills for complex tool interactions. Our company has it's own deployment CLI tool so using skills to make Claude Code an expert at using this tool has done wonders to improve Claude Codes performance when working on CI/CD problems. I am currently working on a new slash command /investigate <service> that runs triage for an active or past incident. I've had Claude write tools to interact with all of our partner services (AWS, JIRA, CI/CD pipelines, GitLab, Datadog) and now when an incident occurs it can quickly put together an early analysis of a incident finding the right people to involve (not just owners but people who last touched the service), potential root causes including service dependency investigations. I am putting this through it's paces now but early results are VERY good! reply",

I have a custom 'code style' system prompt that I want claude to use, and I have been able to add it when using claude in browser - ```\nBeautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit.\nSimple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated.\nReadability counts.\nSpecial cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity.\nIf the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. Trust the context you're given. Don't defend against problems the human didn't ask you to solve.\n``` How can I add it as a system prompt (or if its called something else) in vscode so LLMs adhere to it? reply",

Heck, why isn't there a cornucopia of new apps, even trivial ones? Where is all the shovelware [0]? Previous HN discussion here [1]. Don't get me wrong, AI is at least as game-changing for programming as StackOverflow and Google were back in the day. I use it every day, and it's saved me hours of work for certain specific tasks [2]. But it's simply not a massive 10x force multiplier that some might lead you to believe. I'll start believing when maintainers of complex, actively developed, and widely used open-source projects (e.g. ffmpeg, curl, openssh, sqlite) start raving about a massive uptick in positive contributions, pointing to a concrete influx of high-quality AI-assisted commits.

          "text": "\"Heck, why isn't there a cornucopia of new apps, even trivial ones?\" There is. We had to basically create a new category for them on /r/golang because there was a quite distinct step change near the beginning of this year where suddenly over half the posts to the subreddit were \"I asked my AI to put something together, here's a repo with 4 commits, 3000 lines of code, and an AI-generated README.md. It compiles and I may have even used it once or twice.\" It toned down a bit but it's still half-a-dozen posts a day like that on average. Some of them are at least useful in principle. Some of them are the same sorts of things you'd see twice a month, only now we can see them twice a week if not twice a day. The problem wasn't necessarily the utility or the lack thereof, it was simply the flood of them. It completely disturbed the balance of the subreddit. To the extent that you haven't heard about these, I'd observe that the world already had more apps than you could possibly have ever heard about and the bottleneck was already marketing rather than production. AIs have presumably not successfully done much about helping people market their creations. reply",

I know what you mean, but the thing I find windsurf (which we moved to from copilot) most useful (except writing opeanapi spec files) is asking it questions about the codebase. Just random minutiae that I could find by grepping or following the code, but would take me more than the 30s-1m it takes it. For reference, this is a monorepo of a bit over 1M LoC (and 800k YAML files, because, did I mention I hate API specs?), so not really a small code base either. > I will break down the tasks to the same size as if I was implementing it. But instead of doing it myself, I roughly describe the task on a technical level (and add relevant classes to the context) and it will ask me clarifying questions. After 2-3 rounds the plan usually looks good and I let it implement the task. Here I disagree, sort of. I almost never ask it to do complex tasks, the most time consuming and hardest part is not actually typing out the code, describing it to an AI takes me almost as much time as implementing for most things. One thing I did find very useful is the supertab feature of windsurf, which, at a high level, looks at the changes you started making and starts suggesting the next change. And it's not only limited to repetitive things (like . in vi), if you start adding a parameter to a function, it starts adding it to the docs, to the functions you need below, and starts implementing it. > For me this method allows me to focus on the architecture and overall structure and delegate the plumbing to Copilot.

As an example, one task of the feature was to add metrics for observability when the new action was executed. Another when it failed. My prompt: Create a new metric \"foo.bar\" in MyMetrics when MyService.action was successful and \"foo.bar.failed\" when it failed. I review the plan and let it implement it. As you can see it's a small task and after it is done I review the changes and commit them. Rinse and repeat. I think the biggest issue is that people try to one shot big features or applications.

This is the norm now in the SV startup world at least. You don't just YOLO it. You do extensive planning when features are complex, and you review output carefully. The thing is, if the agent isn't getting it to the point where you feel like you might need to drop down and edit manually, agents are now good enough to do those same \"manual edits\" with nearly 100% reliability if you are specific enough about what you want to do. Instead of \"build me x, y, z\", you can tell it to rename variables, restructure functions, write specific tests, move files around, and so on. So the question isn't so much whether to use an agent or edit code manually—it's what level of detail you work at with the agent.

          "text": "Hi, I’m running a 4-person startup based in Bangkok, Thailand and we differentiate code quality based on priority. We try to ship only clean code on master but when we talk with clients and they want a demo of a new product/feature, we use AI to rapidly create an MVP to see if it aligns with their needs. If they are happy, we then refine this MVP until we are happy with the code through manual review and refactoring, or we even rewrite it. We make sure our data is shaped correctly, hot paths are tested and things are well separated by domain (Domain driven design). DDD ensures us that if the code is shitty, only that part of the project is shitty. Only when the code is acceptable, we rebase to master. I try to let engineers talk to clients so that they learn the most from them first hand and then let them dictate smaller tasks for AI to do —- they are more product managery than what a typical engr would be ten years ago. Do you think this is a good approach? I’m also curious what other startups do too. tldr we aren’t confident of the code we write quickly but we then take time to make sure we’re confident before we merge to master reply",

          "text": "When you say: \"Should schools have a chess variant class where students invent and vibe code novel chess variants and play each other's variants?\" I don't know what you are saying. Sounds more like your objective is to have students brainstorm new ways to play chess. Why is there any indication that the LLM should assume this is a programming question? In fact, it has divined that programming might be involved and offered that certain python libraries might be leveraged. You frame your input as a question about schools offering a certain class and the LLM responded by assuming that is what your objective was and started to help build such a curriculum. Did you expect with your input that the LLM would simply jump into writing some kind of code? Should it have written a multi user chess playground? Should it have written a python chess variant? I personally think it did the reasonable thing and from the context you provided assumed your task was to build such a class pedagogically not produce some python code. If you are focused on chatGPT lumping other forms of \"hacking\" or \"cowboy coding\" into the same bucket as \"LLM Assist\" and calling it all \"Vibe Coding\" I personally don't have an issue with that. They all fall into the bucket of fast and loose coding techniques. That is just my take on it though. reply",

          "text": "Not to argue, but your comment was also thought-provoking, thanks :) It seems like most works of academia are not provoking; rather, they are shaping. Many are written by specialists in the area who carefully choose what to state and suggest, and very often follow the structure of a big \"thought\" that is further explained and explored. Few pop books that might meet my criteria are basically digests, but fact-based ones. It's interesting that \"Thinking, Fast and Slow\" is a middle ground in some sense. Daniel Kahneman is definitely from academia, and in my opinion, he wrote a digest of what he touched on during his career, which was also thought-provoking for me, but not on a big scale. Can you name some works by the mentioned authors that might be called thought-provoking digests of some area of expertise? reply",

The most important thing to learn is how to say \"No\", and that saying \"No\" should be the default answer. You add features when multiple stakeholders agree they are needed, not when one new guy shows up in a meeting. You listen deeply to them all and understand why they are asking for things, and devise a solutions that solves their underlying problem - do not just take their requests at face value and implement them. Then you get to surprise them in UAT, when instead of them telling you that you failed to solve their problems, they tell you: \"Wow, not what we asked for, but this is even better than what we had thought of.\" It is your job to be the expert in what the customers and stakeholders need, so take all those pain points and embrace them as opportunities to learn more deeply what the correct product to build actually is. It is also your job to set the priority, so there is no situation where everything is priority #1. People can tell you their own opinions on what is most important to them, but the actual priority is set by you. reply",

          "text": "The answer to everything is contracts. As far as requirements gathering: 1. Bill the clients for every requirements meeting. Time is money. 2. It’s up to the client to know what they want and up to you to build it. Time spent fantasizing out loud isn’t productive. Build a prototype, and bill them for the time. If it’s not what they want they can either build their own prototype or refine their guidance. Either way it’s time they are paying for just the same. As for scope creep you can handle that one of two ways: 1. Add a change annex to the current contract. This means you will complete the PWS of the base contract first and then bolt the change on at the end as a refactor. 2. Amend the current contract to include additional features. Don’t do this. In the end it’s all about the product work statement. You should think about goal completion only in terms: business objectives (data/money), visual/vanity, regulatory conformance, and extras. reply",

For all those that do - great! But for myself, for whatever reason it just does not scratch that part of my brain. I’d rather spend days writing and debugging code (to create a 5 minute automation ;) ) than having Ai spit something out in 10 seconds.<p>I just use Ai like a supercharged stack overflow. Ask it something if I have a syntax error or whatever, and then move on by continuing to use my own brain to think through the logic and patterns of my project.<p>All that to say - I miss what HN was before Ai and LLMs started dominating everything!<p>Anyone have other spaces, blogs, communities, or whatever where you go to learn and/or discuss interesting things that don’t have anything to do with Ai?</p></p></p></p></div>",

Apparently, some users received emails earlier in the year when it was about to be taken down, but I didn't. There were quite a few images in my history that I would have liked to have saved.<p>Maybe worse is how much this lowers my trust in OpenAI even further than it already had been. Dall-E was not a small platform; it was a cultural phenomenon accessed by hundreds of millions of users. It's bewildering that OpenAI would so silently \"take it behind the shed.\"<p>I'm searching, and it doesn't seem as if there was even an HN post about the shutdown. So, it didn't even hit this place's radar. How many of you are hearing this for the first time?<p>I don't understand how a company like OpenAI could be so reckless with user data integrity and access, particularly when sunsetting a product. All of the big-dog tech platforms have fairly robust protocols for notifying users and allowing them to download their data (even with hoops to jump through). How can they hope to be one while still acting like a \"move fast and break things\" startup? I <i>liked</i> the thing they broke.</p></p></p></div>",

We work with a single restaurant each month to create an 8-12 course all inclusive price fixe menu. The food is served family style and is authentic to the region we are hosting. We typically host the dinners on a Tues or Wed when the restaurants in our region aren’t too busy and could use the extra business. Since 2023 we’ve been to 44 restaurants. In 2025 we served 1,099 guests and generated $126k in revenue. https://www.deadchefssociety.com/ reply",

Looking around your website it seems to me that there's very large attendance, which in my mind means generally less focus on the food itself. Do you think one of the main factors is meeting new people/the sense of community? Anyway good job! I'm not sure what your margins are but it's probably more than 500/month! Congrats! reply",

          "text": "I think there’s quite a few reasons people come. I’m just going to bullet some of them out in no particular order: - We do the work to find the restaurant and curate a menu, story, and theme. E.g., we might go to an Indian restaurant and focus the event on only the southern regional dishes. - Many times we have dishes that are off menu specially for our event. - Sense of community. We have quite a few regulars who have gotten to know each other. In 2025, 45 people reached their 20th or 30th event with us. Since we take over the whole restaurant there’s a little more freedom in how the space is used. Lots of new friendships have been forged. - When you go to a restaurant with a friend or small group, you can only order so much. We’ve had events with upwards of 25 different bites. There’s really no better way to sample everything the restaurant has to offer. - There’s a few people who say their partner are picky eaters, so they come to our event each month to have the opportunity to be a bit more adventurous. It’s an incredibly diverse group with a lot of different reasons to attend. reply",

          "text": "Just my two cents, but: - In terms of data, this is nothing compared to any site serving a bunch of images. The compute would differ, but loading speed shouldn't be an issue if you can render the HTML first, and hydrate it after page load. This static HTML would then also serve as fallback when Javascript is disabled. - For a quick demo, I doubt you will lose people by embedding an older version. Serving a version of a few months ago seems like 80% of the work, with 20% of the effort, in terms of deployment. Anyhow, nice to see government funds put to a good cause! reply",

It started as a small side project but slowly grew every month and recently exploded to well over 50k USD revenue per month. It's fun to have a large community of paying users but honestly I never thought out of all my side projects this one will make it. I am still a one man show managing everything from development, marketing, customer support and content moderation. If I am honest the money is nice but I am severely burnt out and not sure if I can or want to do this much longer. It is a 24/7 job and I miss the days where I can just sit down and code a nice feature that people will like. Also looking at NSFW content all day kind of messes with your mental health. I had some discussions of potential buyers but selling something for less than its monthly revenue seems crazy so I am still here trying to do my best and waiting for the right exit. reply",

It uses Reddit, news, polymarket, Google Trends and many other data sources to take investment decisions. - @Polyglot_lingua_bot -> a voice-enabled Telegram-based bot that can help you learn new languages. - https://select.supply -> a directory of carefully-curated and well-crafted products. All of those allowed me to quit my day job and live a comfortable and flexible life. I still invest time in maintenance and adding new features, but I love coding, marketing and everything that comes with promoting and selling a SaaS (and I also have a serious addiction for Stripe notifications).

If all machines are busy, then the request goes into a queue already and is being picked up by the first machine that becomes available. Also, the user got the pictures after just a few minutes and there is a clear disclaimer, and an email is being sent to the user once the pics are ready. On top of that, I have no complaints from other users about it. It's clear to me that the intent of the user was to cause some reputation harm, which I think didn't work. I also got an email from a person with the same first name (not sure if it's the same person tho) that they offer UX services for Headsnap. reply",

Both websites are clean and the designs are nice but struggle on mobile it seems (I'm on Android, Brave browser, horizontal scroll seems to be buggy). I wish there was additional information outside of just what they do - I'd like to know more about the developer that created them, goals/ambitions for the future, that kind of thing. Right now, the investment app looks like a scam from an outside perspective. One page, limited information, nothing personal about it. How can I trust such a website with my hard earned cash? I think an improvement would be to have additional pages on who you are, why I should trust you, and what exactly I might get in return for my subscription. It's also probably important to make it clear that you cannot promise any long term profits from this app and that it is almost akin to gambling so users should be prepared to lose money. reply",

Your site has quite literally zero details on it. It’s a bunch of fluff on the landing page. Why would anyone signup without any information about what they are signing up for. Your response to a question about sourcing it’s odd. You only mention 10qs which you built a scraper for but the docs you linked to don’t really have much in the way of 10q data. Some surface metadata but none of the guts of a 10q. Most of the data you linked to is market data that you would have to be sourcing through a third party. It’s just an odd response for someone like me who works in the industry that you mention 10q but none of the data is really what I would consider 10q data. Wish you luck but don’t take honest opinions from someone who buys significant amounts of financial data as someone trying to promote a service. Just linking someone I would consider a competitor to yours in the Edgar space. The question is about financials and nothing you linked to is about financials. reply",

Not just the rules, but the dynamics: what’s repeatable, what’s luck, and what actually matters.<p>By using the Kevin Bacon-number idea: I can usually get within three degrees of separation of well-known technologists like Linus Torvalds, but I can’t seem to get within three steps of someone who confidently understands how HN works.<p>So I’m asking sincerely:\nDoes anyone here feel they understand Hacker News?\nIf so, what are the real levers, and what do people consistently misunderstand?<p>PS: This question comes from a mix of genuine curiosity and personal frustration.

I've made friends here, have been helped by people on projects that I was busy with, did the reverse, found friends and business partners and spend way too much time. HN is a very interesting slice of the online world, a place that is unlike the rest, sometimes a bit dry but always interesting and extremely useful. If you're looking at it to try to understand it then you might as well try to understand a rat or a mouse. You won't understand it because it isn't there to be understood, it just is, like any other organism. The root of HN is a thing called 'startup news', that was changed very quickly and since then HN has been a focal point for techies of all sorts but also lots of other people from all walks of life and from a large variety of countries. It isn't 'one thing' to everybody that participates, just like a hammer is a different thing for a carpenter than it is for a masoner or a farmer. The fact that after being a member for a couple of years you have this question indicates a lack of participation, not a lack of understanding. reply",

Everything has a cost. For the web, that's typically monetary or your data and attention to advertisers. I think you're right that the cost of Hacker News is that my participation is lending some (tiny incremental) legitimacy to Y Combinator. It's also costing some tiny amount of my attention, in the sense that I may not have heard of Y Combinator if it weren't for Hacker News. For me personally, that is absolutely fine – but I'm glad you made it explicit so that it's a conscious choice.

She invited me to dinner recently and fed me delicious food, and we drank very good champagne. That was an unexpected bonus. “To promote ycombinator” only works if there’s an audience worth promoting to. Building something great that brings people back day after day maybe has the result that it can also serve as a promotional tool - but that’s a bonus, not necessarily a purpose. I’m not the person you asked the question of - but I think the purpose of ycombinator is to give relevant people a place to discuss things aligned with the ecosystem in which ycombinator operates, to help strengthen and champion that ecosystem. Does it have a payoff for ycombinator? Almost certainly. Was it created with that explicit purpose in mind? I doubt it. There are easier ways to make money. reply",

The reason why HN is so much better than other fora (IMO) is that the mods don't allow lever-pulling and astroturfing to overtake regular contributions. Yet it's also popular, so you're bound to get some activity on most posts. Sure, it can be frustrating if you're trying to promote a product or farm karma on posts. But the fact that mostly nobody cares about karma means that you can post something and have it be evaluated on its technical, economic, social merits. Obviously, there are caveats to this - i.e., anything US- and FAANG-related is bound to get much more activity than otherwise - but the overall atmosphere of HN is refreshing compared to Reddit. reply",

          "text": "I can't know for sure. For me, it's just the \"eyeball method\" of comparing HN and different subreddits on Reddit. As to how I (or anyone) could show this, here are a few example questions: 1. How many examples of stealthy but otherwise blatant promotion do you see in the comments? Not every astroturfing campaign will be successful or original, so you'd be able to notice some patterns. Plus, HN is already commercially oriented, and there's the \"Show HN\" option, so it reduces the incentives for astroturfing. 2. Alternatively, how much controversy is there around the specific type of forum? For some subreddits, for example, you'd be able to see counter-subreddits popping up when participants feel the mods are abusing their power to promote one type of opinion. 3. Is a certain type of political/brand-related opinion or interpretation always at the top of your comment feed? For example, if upvotes determine the order of the comments, do you consistently see fewer critical comments on things that you'd expect the community to react to in different ways. 4. Do you consistently see some contributors having more power in discussions over others? Other than the mods, obviously. If this is the case, karma (i.e., number of upvotes) often has more value. Still, I could be wrong. reply",

          "text": "(I'm a mod here) It's true that this place can be cryptic, and that has downsides—specifically, it can be confusing to newcomers, even to some newcomers who would make ideal HN users. That sucks. But there's a key that unlocks most of the puzzles. That is to understand that we're optimizing for exactly one thing: curiosity. (Specifically, intellectual curiosity, since there are other kinds of curiosity too.) Here are links to past explanations about that: https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&sor... We try to elevate things that gratify curiosity: creative work, surprising discoveries, deep dives, technical achievements, unusual personal experience, whimsical unpredictability, good conversation, etc. And we try to demote things that run against curiosity, especially repetition, indignation, sensationalism, and promotion. It gets complicated because you'll also see plenty of repetition, indignation, sensationalism, and promotion on HN—alas! This is the internet after all. But the site survives because the balance of these things stays within tolerable ranges, thanks to two factors: an active community which cares greatly about preserving this place for intended purpose ( https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html ); and an owner (Y Combinator) which pays us to work on the site full time and mainly just wants us to keep it good, to the extent possible. If you really want to figure this place out, the way to do it is as a reader . Hang out on the site, look at the mix of articles that make the frontpage, spend time in the discussion threads (hopefully the interesting sectors and not the flamey ones!), and over time your eyes will adjust. What doesn't work—and this is good because we want it not to work—is approaching HN as a platform for promoting content. If you (<-- I don't mean you personally, but anyone) mainly care about \"how can I use this thing to get attention for my startup/blog/project/newsletter\", then you're operating in 'push' mode rather than 'pull' mode (or, even better, 'idle' mode). In that case you won't be curious because you're too focused on what you're wanting for extraneous reasons—and if you aren't in a state of curiosity, this place won't make sense. At least we hope it won't! reply",

Honestly hackernews to me is a place where tinkering as a hobby is appreciated. I have read so many large threads here and ended up sometimes having a new point of view on something and so many posts here which make me want to be curious and tinker around too. I cannot really name something exactly which clicks on hackernews but that is what makes it unique and this does mean I cannot explain it to others sometimes since my hobbies are tangential to hackernews too, I just end up saying my hobby is tinkering with computers (currently only software) reply",

More sneaky would be answering the question with the recommendation from a different account in a way to promote your service and have that upvoted, but that requires more effort and skill I assume. But in general yes, this community definitely can also be manipulated, but I would say it is one of the hardest to fool.

I expect the list to have no obvious patterns except that they are wildly nerdy or unexpectedly useful.  To be clear, I am not suggesting this list to make it easier for the original poster to manipulate the HN system.  The readers here are way too discerning to be easily fooled by something obviously commercial appearing under the \"Show HN\" banner. Two people that come to mind that normally generate an enormous number of upvotes and discussion are blog posts from Alyssa Rosenzweig (Asahi Linux GPU drivers) and Justine Tunney (Cosmopolitan Libc).  Both of those projects trigger near-superhuman levels of nerd sniping ( https://xkcd.com/356/ ).  Few nerds can resist! Final note: To me, this question feels like the \"uncanny valley\" of nerd discussion boards.  Can you imagine posting something similar to LWN.net trying to figure out how to get your commercial project featured in a story? reply",

Not too many people read the \"New\" page and articles drop off it pretty quickly, so it can be hard for a niche article to attract the handful of votes it needs to appear on the front page.  (Though there is a \"second chance\" feature which helps to ameliorate this issue.)  So there's a lot of randomness to what makes it onto the front page. For instance I submitted an article three times (spaced a year apart).  The first two times the article got no upvotes.  The third time it got 600+ and hit the top of the front page.  It's just a matter of who happens to be looking at the New page at the time. reply",

This is not really your average front-page at the moment, and in fact it feels significantly more geared towards curiosity and less towards commercial interests compared with the usual.  Partly because it's the holiday slow down but you see the same effect on weekends, which is telling.  And IMHO hacker news is consistently more curious when America is sleeping. HN desperately needs tags, which would serve everyone well, whether you're really here for curiosity or for all the corporate news.  I'd really like to be able filter out most of the stuff for \"working professionals\" even if it is  still legitimately technical (for example the recent docker and github news).  What I usually want is all the hobby tech / PLT / open-source / science / learning-oriented stuff that's left over after that filter.

People accept that platforms should be centralised, and that they should harvest your data in order to sell it to adtech companies who will then feed it to an industry that learns in real-time how to prey on your darkest fears to sell you things you don't need but might make you feel slightly less sad for a second. And people just accept it: that's normal these days. They even call it doom-scrolling, and don't ask \"wait, should I want to scroll through actual doom ? Is the occasional video that makes me smile really worth it all?\" Perhaps it's my age, but I can't understand anybody who says their main form of media consumption is YouTube. How? How do you actually put up with that, knowing what is behind every mouse movement and click, and the knowledge that every single pixel in front of you is being tweaked by robotic neuroscientists squeezing every drop out of A/B tests to make you feel like utter crap? Like, seriously, WTAF? HN is popular within its niche precisely because it isn't like that. It is not \"a platform\", in the modern and now normalised sense. It links out to other sites and asks people to come back together to discuss what they saw there. Old school. No ad tracking. No doom scrolling. Pick what you like. Click it, don't click it. Discuss it, don't discuss it. Nobody is tracking \"engagement\". There's some gamification, but does anyone _really_ care? This type of interaction is entirely native to my generation and older (I just squeak into millennial, on the older side), but feels completely bonkers to people who think Facebook, Instagram and TikTok are what is normal and how the Internet works. Some of know they're not normal. We know they're aberrations, ghouls that prey on unwitting masses. reply",

What’s strange is that this happens before I even know what the message actually says.<p>In most cases, it turns out to be routine or harmless. Still, the anxious reaction comes first and sometimes lingers until I fully understand the content.<p>I’m not looking for personal advice, but I’m curious whether this response is tied to how humans process authority, uncertainty, or perceived consequences. Is there any psychological or cognitive explanation for why the <i>anticipation</i> alone triggers stress, even when experience says it’s usually nothing serious?</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "https://mytinycafe.com/ An PWA primarily for my wife and my daughter. They can order their hot chocolate and their coffee as if they were going to grab something at a fancy café downtown, but instead it's at home and I'm the barista. It is quite nice to have for when my wife comes back from work and want something specific, or when we are waiting for the visit of a few friend, they can order exactly the available beverages and everything is ready when they're here. It was also a good playground for me to implement Web Push notifications (to never miss new orders). It's a basic Nuxt 3 app with Appwrite as the backend with rough edges, but much enough for our household use ! If you want to spam my phone with notifications, please visit my café : https://mytinycafe.com/alix reply",

I've updated a port of WxWidgets and now I support all the features KiCad needs with ~200 tests. Right now I have a build that loads in the browser, but I really want to have \"multithreading\" which means workers in the web. One can use asyncify with emscripten to translate blocking C++ to WASM, but that transition is not perfect, right now I'm debugging a bug where there's a race condition that halts all execution and the main thread runs in an infinite loop waiting for the workers to stand up. I guess I'll have a few of those ahead. The main goal is to 1. just have fun 2. use yjs as a collab backend so multiple people can edit the same PCB. This will probably work with pcbnew, KiCad's layout editor, since it has a plugin system and AFAIK I can do the sync layer there. For the rest ( schematic, component editor etc. ) I'll have to figure out something..\nKiCad does not sync automatically if you modify a file, I'll have to do some lifting there. Anyway, it's a lot of fun, I really want this thing to exist, I'm hoping that I won't run into a \"wellll, this is just not going to work\" kind of issue in the end. reply",

          "text": "On the subject of whisper being great... A few weeks ago a co-worker commented about the difficulty he'd had editing a work demo, I pointed at various jump-cutting tools that had automated what he did in the past (editing out silences). But I'd also wanted to play with whisper for a while... So a couple of hours later I'd written a script that does transcription based editing: on the first pass it grabs a timestamped transcript and a plain text transcript for editing; you edit the words into any order you like and a second pass reassembles the video (it's just a couple of hundred lines of python wrapping whisper and ffmpeg). It also speeds up 4x any silences detected that sit within retained sequences in the video. Matching up transcripts turns out to be not that hard; I normalise the text, split it, and then compare to the sequence of normalised words from the timestamped transcript. I find the longest common sequence, keep that, then recurse on the before/after sections (there's a little more detail, but not much). I also sent the transcription to ffmpeg to burn in as captions, because sometimes it makes the audio choppy and the captions make it easier to follow. I know, tools have been doing this for years now. I just didn't have one to hand, and now I do, and I couldn't have done this without whisper. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I have a media server project that I want to work on. But I'm stuck on one thing, convenience vs privacy.<p>As the project is about spinning your own server (media server), I want to have a smoother way to have a simple account system where the user just enters an email and a password, and get the server/ip list (everything from there is done on the actual server). For example, a user could be invited to 2 servers, and would see them in the same page, which makes things more straight-forward and a lot easier.<p>Now, I thought a lot about it, and mostly came down to the conclusion that centralizing it is the most sane option. The data itself comes down to: email, encrypted password, encrypted IP(s) list (via key exchanges).Is there any-way to do it decentralized? I searched, even asked LLMs, but nothing felt solid (best was a Nostr suggestion) but such method would make emails, password resets painful or almost impossible. I don't know a lot regarding this topic so its quite the challenge.<p>What's the point/why not just use URL? convenience. I know, but it SUCKS having to give a parent a URL, even with some techy friends it takes a bit communicating it. I want to eliminate as much friction as possible. Also, if centralized, this has the ability that users don't need to buy a domain, setup lets encrypt and all that which costs money and time (especially for simple/new selfhosters); its a lot nicer and smoother and in a way provide better privacy out-of-the-box.<p>Note, This project doesn't even exist yet. But I'm pursuing quite soon. I also only took 1 encryption course back in college days, while I understood and was good at it, I still need to audit/verify my method. \nIt basically is: \n1. hash the password+salt in a different algorithm, save the private key from it and send the public key to the central server \n2. (media server owner wants to invite) the media server checks for a public key, encrypts the message containing all the details (IP, status, ports etc), and sends the encrypted message to the central server. \n3. The client later checks, if there's a new message, it decrypts the ip/info from the server and connect.<p>Every device can login in this way and grab server list info securely. There's gonna be some sort of way to \"quick connect\" on TVs and such, and change passwords, but I don't want to get ahead of myself for now. I don't think the IP/server-info encryption suffers from any major things, but that's the general core principle. I maybe (probably?) have missed something.<p>The only issues I can maybe think of, is a \"centralized\" URL/domain would be showing up all the time instead of the owner. Note, it would be designed in a way that would allow you to instead send them to your own URL/domain and such.<p>Anyways, let me know what would be best. btw I'm not rich but such simple \"auth\" server would probably cost like $5/m + 2x5/m for redundancies, shouldn't be too bad.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Decentralized auth is a fascinating technical rabbit hole, but it introduces a massive friction point for your first 1,000 users. For a new, unproven project, credibility is your biggest bottleneck, not decentralized storage. By building your own complex auth/privacy stack, you are asking users to trust you to get the crypto right—which is a huge leap of faith. A more pragmatic approach: Outsource the trust. > Use 'Sign in with Google/Apple/GitHub.' You leverage their multi-billion dollar security infrastructure and their existing trust relationship with the user. It provides immediate convenience (one-click onboarding) and shifts the perceived privacy liability to a known entity. Don't spend your innovation tokens on auth. Spend them on the core value of your information exchange. You can always 'decentralize' the back-end later once you have enough users to actually make it matter. reply",

A good development process with ticket discussions would ensure that someone <i>doesn't</i> do a lot of work before there is agreement on the general approach. But now, with AI, this script no longer works, partially because it's \"too easy\" to do it before even deciding this.<p>So I'm asking myself and now HN: is it OK to point out when an entire PR as such is garbage and should simply be discarded? How can I tell how much \"brain juice\" a co-worker has spent on it and how attached they might be to it by now if I don't even know whether they even know the code they submitted or not?<p>I have to admit that I <i>hate</i> reviewing huge PRs and the problem with AI generated code is that often it would have been much better to find and use an existing open-source library to get the task done rather than (re-)generate a lot of code for it. But how will I know this until I've actually taken the time to review and understand the big, new proposed contributions? And even if I now <i>do</i> spend the time to actually understand the code and implied approach, how will I know which part of it reflects their genuine opinion and intellect (which I'd be hesitant to criticize) and what is AI-fluff I can rip apart without stepping on their toes? If the answer is \"let's have a meeting\", then I'd say the process has failed.<p>Not sure there is a right answer here, but I would love to hear people's take on this.</p></p></p></p></div>",

The 'algorithm' is my own intent.\nAI is a Filtering system: AI is probabilistic. Its entire job is to guess what I want, which by definition means it creates a 'lossy' stream.\nPeople claim AI can 'replace' RSS by summarizing my interests, but AI will never be able to provide the certainty of a feed. I don't want an AI to 'guess' which security advisory or niche technical blog post I should read today; I want the raw signal that I explicitly requested.\nAs long as there are professionals who value information completeness over algorithmic convenience, RSS (or its successor) will be a hard requirement.

Paul Graham’s idea that essays are a way to learn really resonates with me. But I rarely publish anything beyond occasional LinkedIn posts.<p>My blockers:<p>•“Nobody needs this” / “It’s not original”<p>•“AI can explain most topics better than I can”<p>•A bit of fear: shipping something that feels naive or low-signal<p>At the same time, I read a lot of personal blogs + LinkedIn and I do get real value from them — mostly from perspective, lived experience, and clear thinking, not novelty.<p>For those of you who blog (or used to):<p>•What made it worth it for you?<p>•What kinds of posts actually worked (for learning, career, network, opportunities)?<p>•Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)?<p>•If you were starting today, what would you do differently?<p>I’m not trying to build a media business — more like building a “public notebook” that compounds over years.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Above all, it's accessible to everyone, not just those on a specific platform. I've had a blog for almost 20 years. Nowadays, it's the best record I have of what I'm interested in and working on. It has recipes I send to my friends, context for strangers. It's a beacon that attracts similar people, a call for them to reach out. And it works! I get emails about my posts. I helped people travel along the same routes, and fixed people's technical issues. Another blog of mine turned into a lifestyle business. I have met countless friends and two lovers through it. So yeah, do your thing, put it online. Start simple, migrate as needed. I love static sites because they're low maintenance. Hugo and a theme would be good. reply",

          "text": "AI can explain most topics better than I can This one is demonstrably false. Your personal written style is what's important. Also, you have hands-on experience, which is also demonstrably more than any \"AI\" has. I urge you to ignore this kind of doubt or consideration. - What kinds of posts actually worked (for learning, career, network, opportunities)? For learning, \"book report\" type posts, just to solidify what I've read in my mind, maybe drive a little experimentation to ensure I've concluded correctly. I've decided not to collect any metrics so that I don't follow from behind, so that I don't end up doing clickbait. Career and network opportunities have not arisen from my blog. My \"public notebook\" posts get more traffic, and I've referred back to them, but for me, these are mostly Linux sysadmin topics. I'd wager these are most valuable to people that find them for very specific problems, like seeing LLDP info from inside a WiFi access point or fixing GRUB problems on particular hardware. - Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)? I have not discovered anything for this, alas. I use Hugo, I have a couple of little shell scripts to do monthly counts of finished vs draft articles. I try to stay at or above 5 posts a month. I'm not sure that helps lower the bar, which I interpret as \"provide motivation to post\". What would I do differently? Start a blog years before I actually did so. I'm happy to correspond, my email is in my HN profile. reply",

          "text": "Hey, just wanted to let you know that your honeypot data for PHP-based attacks ended up factoring in charges being dropped in two criminal cases where prosecution attempted to run with a harebrained and ludicrous theory that basically centered around some... mythical idea of how these attacks happen and how specific they can be. The criminal justice system is where lurid fantasies of how tech works end up putting people in prison for sometimes years and budget concerns meant that attorneys filled parking meters every 4 hours and we had two full time investigators in an office of 40, most with a 80-120 caseload (rolling basis). Sometimes the data one puts online can really make an impact that my guess is that it was entirely unexpected and for two people in their 20s with young kids (separate cases, in fact, although not too far apart), it really reclaimed a good chunk of their lives. Thank you for that, and I hope others would do the same, because one never knows when it'll come in handy. So many products sold to LE are basically snake oil and without data and facts, the threat is incredibly coercive. Any leverage for defense helps balancing the playing field and frankly, nobody deserves to be taken to trial based on utter BS that has merit merely because it matches the equally unfounded anxieties of people, however unsubstantiated.Thanks again! reply",

You're also not clear if the \"learning\" is for you as the author, or for the reader. If you want to have your content discovered online, I'd say you might be in for some trouble, although I don't think AI is the cause, only an accelerator on that. Blogs for readers learning are probably in decline, you're unlikely to get any outreach based on your posts for networking. However if, like me, the writing process is the point – you're trying to clarify your thoughts, learn something new yourself, or have a document you can share with colleagues when they ask you to explain your opinions, I think blogging is valuable.

I don’t have links to either anywhere on the internet and they are both hosted on micro.blog. I am a customer facing  staff cloud consultant (specializing in app dev - “application modernization”) and when I have new personal insight, I randomly ramble to ChatGPT and ask it to give me a “devils advocate” response or a “steel man’s response”.  I go back and forth and give it my responses. I ask it to write a blog post about our discussion.  I have instructions like no em dashes, no “not $x. But $y”.  No call to action etc. I still edit the output heavily.  Once I am satisfied, I post it to my blog. My blog doesn’t have my name attached to it anywhere or any contact information. I do review it sometimes. What I feel is a really good post after a bunch of edits and giving it  time to marinate, gets copied to LinkedIn - with no link back to my blog. Even then I don’t care about “engagement”.  It’s so I will have a corpus of well thought out posts if I am looking for a job later. The other types of posts are just links, with a quote from the article and if I saw the article on HN, I link to the comments. I don’t need network opportunities through my posts.  I’ve been in the tech industry for 30 years this coming June and I’ve been in consulting 6.  I have plenty of industry contacts and a solid reputation. FWIW:  the other blog is just recording my frequent travels and concerts with my wife. reply",

What do you mean by \"lowers the bar\"? The length of my posts can be pretty variable, cadence is \"whenever\" and the blog can go months without an update, and themes are also pretty varied, sometimes I talk about some piece of fiction I like, other times it gets more technical, and sometimes too I just recount the process of making something and the insights it gave me. >If you were starting today, what would you do differently?

Write a diary for yourself if you want, fine, but what exactly are you gaining by putting it out there? It's even worse if you have to force yourself to do it, which appears to be the case here. Force yourself to exercise every day, because that's good for your physical health, but is blogging good for your health? Writing in public is performance art. Some people are naturally performance artists and need to perform to satisfy some internal urge. If you're not one of them, don't let anyone else convince you that you need to be one. It's ok to not blog. The idea that everyone should have a blog is completely unjustified. I read another comment that said you should write blog posts at least once a week.

          "text": "Yes, if you treat it as an instrument, not an audience product. The main value of a personal blog was never distribution. It’s externalized thinking. Writing forces you to make assumptions explicit, notice gaps, and resolve contradictions. That doesn’t get replaced by AI — if anything, AI makes undisciplined thinking easier to hide. The posts that tend to compound aren’t “explainers.” They’re records of decisions, trade-offs, failures, and mental models you’ve actually tested. That’s where perspective comes from, and that’s the part AI can’t synthesize for you. If starting today, I’d optimize for low friction and long half-life: short notes, irregular cadence, one theme you’re actively working on. Treat it as a public lab notebook. If it’s useful to your future self, it will eventually be useful to someone else. reply",

          "text": "Writing is difficult and like all art forms, it’s subject to impostor syndrome. Blogging is the best way I have found to remind yourself that you’re not an impostor. And the more experience you get proving you’re not an impostor, the easier impostor syndrome is to deal with. Realistically if you start now, you’re years away from a devoted readership and that’s fine. You’ll gain from publishing and if you’re diligent, you’ll gain from watching your writing improve. For me, I like writing and can’t get paid enough in publishing or as a writer to do it professionally. So it’s worth it for me because I have a lot of fun writing. I spent a good part of my life hunting for eyeballs and now I’m content just writing whether anyone reads it or not. I’m not sure that I’d recommend any particular theme, cadence or style for a new blogger. And I definitely wouldn’t recommend a style of post. Rather those sorts of things will come organically as you get used to writing and start building a community. When you’re getting started, just focus on writing, trying to build habits and learning how to edit yourself. Most writers will struggle with one of the three on their way to developing a voice so if you’re going through hell you’re likely on the right path. If I were starting today, I’d focus less on hunting eyeballs and more on writing for the joy of it. I’d also spend a lot more time writing about subjects that I’m not interested in because that’s really good practice. And finally, I wouldn’t worry so much about writer’s block - it happens, it sucks but it goes away when you stop worrying about it. On the subject of writer’s block, if it’s something you struggle with I have a great exercise for you. When you’re stuck, interview yourself about the finished piece you’re stuck on. Pretend it’s done and interview yourself. I would have started doing that twenty five years ago and I’d be a far better writer now because of it. Finally, keep everything you write and read it regularly but there’s nothing wrong with pruning your blog regularly. If things you wrote two years ago are embarrassing today that means you’re a better writer. Go with that. reply",

I'm the wrong person to ask about discoverability because I've been blogging for 22 years and I've accumulated 100,000+ followers on Twitter, 39,000 on Bluesky etc. It's worth offering an email subscribe mechanism. I didn't do that for the first ~20 years - I offered just an RSS feed - but when I added the Substack newsletter option it become clear I should have been gathering email addresses from a lot earlier on! Despite having a substantial audience visiting my site now I still think the best way to get traffic to an article is to tell people about it elsewhere. I follow the POSSE principle: publish on own site, syndicate elsewhere: https://indieweb.org/POSSE Honestly though quality is much more important than quantity. Join communities of like-minded individuals and make sure that a small number of engaged people get to see your stuff. Opportunities from that are likely to be more valuable than if you have a much larger audience who aren't as closely aligned with what you're publishing. reply",

Re blockers: - Novelty: I routinely search for very niche, \"boring\" information, and am disappointed by how few in-depth blogposts I find. - “AI can explain most topics better than I can”. I doubt it!  I rarely find current AI as valuable as a good blog post. It tends to be shallow and regress to the mean, and b/c of hallucinations it's untrustworthy, so a lot of time is wasted fact-checking. - Fear of shipping: if it isn't relevant, nobody will read it (unless you're already famous) Re questions: - What made it worth it for you? Clarifying my thoughts, connecting with strangers who think about the same things, the leverage \"having a platform\" produces (it opens a lot of doors), and gaining prestige in certain niches. - What kinds of posts actually worked (for learning, career, network, opportunities)? I don't think this is simple to answer until the heat death of the universe. Traffic stats is a very poor estimator of value delivered. Which posts I am most proud of, and how much traffic they got, are weakly correlated. - Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)? Things that you are obsessed with. It's a tonne of work writing a good post, and sometimes you publish it and nobody cares, so it has to be intrinsically rewarding. - If you were starting today, what would you do differently? I don't know! Probably put less effort into trying to appear intelligent/impressive, which rarely works anyway. These are my off-the-top thoughts based on over a decade of blogging. reply",

In that thread, I would have written up some long rant-y comment and realize a few things: 1) No one will ever read this. 2) Why am I giving this site free content? 3) I can use this for my blog. I should save it for later. So, I grab all of the info that sparked the comment and throw it into my drafts. The hope is that if I have some downtime later on, I'll work on some of the drafted ideas I have stored. Besides that, I also use my blog as a way to document the various things I've learned, discovered, or setup for my home lab. Having some online documentation of that information (that can also serve as a dual role of showing that I am technically knowledgeable) can help me down the road, when I re-forget all of that information. reply",

Here's one of mine, where in 2018 I look back on predictions made in 2012. Some held up well, some, it turned out, were physically impossible : https://benwheatley.github.io/blog/2018/07/17-16.09.05.html Naïve errors: Optical-wavelength metamaterial cloaking, fabric or otherwise, is not possible, the bandwidth is too narrow; Robot cars may be technically available in many countries, but they're sure not \"rapidly displacing human drivers because they are much safer and therefore cheaper to insure\". Close but no cigar: Nameplate solar power didn't reach par with global electricity use in 2024, but it did get to 1865 TW, which would have been 82% of global electricity use at the time I made the prediction. Actual global electricity use is 50% higher today than in 2012. Correct: China's GDP did in fact more than double between 2012 and 2022: https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=GDP+china+2022+%2F+GDP+... > •Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)? Something you find interesting. Look at my blog and you won't only find deep thoughts, you'll also find this because it was fun at the time: https://benwheatley.github.io/blog/2018/12/21-09.27.02.html But not just jokes, because I'll also write about bioprinted fairy drones: https://benwheatley.github.io/blog/2021/05/22-21.06.36.html reply",

Though I don't regret it and learned enough to speak to my in-laws. My retention numbers are decent, but I just haven't done the marketing bit yet, and am currently taking a break. Language learning apps are the ultimate sand-pit for solo developers thinking they can offer some random unique feature that Duolingo (or \"Anki but better\") doesn't offer. Without realizing, they don't do it for a reason. Language learning has extremely low activation and retention. And it's super easy to find one or two early adopters that like your app for some reason to keep going. And solo developers that get into language learning often are only strong in software development and lack in UX, design, product, or marketing. You may start with a calm, \"not Duolingo gamification\" style app, but every language learning app starts with pure intentions until you're many months or years in, your numbers are low, you need to make money, and you need to move the needle. My two cents, you don't have to heed it obviously. reply",

For what it's worth none of the other language apps stick either.

          "text": "I’ve been working on a product for a little while that Ivan Illich would call a “convivial tool,” one that doesn’t take from the user but makes them more effective, independent, and creative from its use.  I’ve been interested in these kinds of tools for a long time, but I feel some sense of urgency in the LLM era, where I’ve already seen peers lose their edge by offloading the cognitive work. I’ve been interested in these kinds of tools for a while, that actually act as a bicycle for the mind. Most apps forgo the metacognitive and emotional labor that actually helps people learn effectively in favor of gamification because 1. Modeling these skills is hard 2. The first step to building effective learning habits is to restore the so-called “learn drive” which is the love of learning, play, and tinkering that underlies most effective learning and gamification does so but on an artificial level. There is so much content out there, and a sufficiently motivated person will find it and make meaning out of it. Most people are not motivated and don’t know how to motivate, meander, explore without gritting teeth, and I think you’ll probably just see churn without gamification unless you deal with that side of the process. Since I've tried to ship such tools before and ultimately failed, I’m explicitly not doing the whole SV fail fast and iterate thing here: I’m meandering, taking my time, letting motivation move me when it strikes versus going for the easiest or most obvious thing. (also sorry if this is itself meandering: I’m lifting while typing this on my phone) reply",

          "text": "That approach might be at odds with the market, but I don't think it's at odds with learning. I strongly dislike duolingo - it's gamification kept me pre-occupied for a while without noticing that I wasn't making any progress learning the language. When I figured that out, I felt cheated by the app! A long time ago I used a beta app that was being built by a high school teacher that I really enjoyed. It basically had a bunch on YouTube videos with a few different type of exercises. Unfortunately I had a busy schedule and couldn't keep up and I don't think the app was successful. My day job is development in the education space. If you care about building a learning app, read up on learning theory / pedagogy. A concept I really like wrt language learning is \"comprehensible input\". Other things to consider with languages is that hearing native speakers is extremely important. ps. wrt to gamification - I wish that people took the parts of games that I do like when they gamify an experience - open worlds, exploration, story telling, low stakes, save points, fun! reply",

The best two apps right now IMHO are Reading.com and Mentava, and they take radically different approaches. Mentava is pretty gamified and kids can use it on its own, whereas Reading.com is basically a computer implementation of Siegfried Engelmann's instructional approach. Has to be used with a parent accompaniment, and most of the onscreen widgets are just there to facilitate co-teaching. Both apps are good and seem to be landing with their target markets, obviously the simpler one is aiming at a lower price point. Poor gamification is a bigger risk than non-gamification done well IMHO. That's where a lot of children's learning apps have failed in the past. reply",

To me it illustrates that it's such a fine line to walk if you want to respect the user but also maybe push through their own lack of motivation. (I'm not a user of Duolingo so I can't speak to where they land on that but it's clearly controversial) reply",

I’ve spent last few weeks studying other successful educational products. And so far, from my research,  pretty much every single one of these apps/sites prioritized making the user “feel good” about learning rather than actually learning. And unfortunately, this is what the users want. They want to feel good about learning. All the successful education sites employ these mechanisms that you’re intending to avoid. I wanted to avoid using these as well - but I  just don’t see another way. I’ve even had users explicitly ask me to add milestones, streaks, etc to motivate them. Reality is - most people who really want to study or learn anything, can do so without an app. Even a book from a library will do. But it requires tremendous consistency, effort and time. Apps are way easier and make the user feel good - there’s still learning being done, don’t get me wrong. But user feeling good about it is what keeps them coming back. Edit: I’ve also studied many of their ads. Often times on places like TikTok, Instagram, etc their ads are what I would call “intelligence porn”. They get you excited about being more intelligent, investing in yourself, intelligence eliticism, etc. These were a common ad strategy that I have discovered so far. Some apps literally ran ads with text: “become dangerously intelligent” text and had the song from the show Succession play with images of famous researchers and scientists changing quickly. (Newton, Einstein, etc). Stuff like this cracked me up tbh lol. But apparently it works reply",

Every time the word \"gamification\" comes up in a conversation (with users, customers, internet posts), it reminds me of the quote from the great Charlie Munger \"Show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome\". Basically, gamification is supposed to incentivize the learner but a majority of training/learnings are unfortunately mostly about \"checking a box\" especially when it comes to required/regulated trainings (I mostly work with customers in these areas). So if you are building a learning app where learning is forced on the learner by someone else (their boss, employer, parent etc), then gamification won't be of any real use. No one will care if they just unlocked some imaginary points. On the other hand, my kids love learning in apps like Duolingo where they are proud of the \"streak\" they have for continuous number of days. But here is the thing. No one asked them to learn this stuff. They got interested (by watching a friend etc) and now they are playing the same game. reply",

But, watching the interview with the Duolingo CEO linked in this thread, he's talking about reaching the far larger set of people that don't have strong intrinsic motivation to learn. Which is arguably a much more difficult and more important mission. The natural learners (and kids of white-collar parents) are already pretty well-equipped by the general state of the internet.

Books are the limit example. Karpathy's \"Let's build GPT\" is another. Most learning products -- and all apps -- live or die by the container they create. (There is no reason to build a learning app other than to build a container. If you feel you have the best content, ship it on a content platform and save yourself a very painful distribution slog. Duolingo is in the container game. Their container is made of every cheap trick in the book -- notifications, streaks, etc -- because they work. My startup was Hack Reactor, the coding bootcamp, and we did it with pair programming and fixed classroom hours. (We had great content, but our competitors with good containers and bad content did leagues better than vice versa.) If you're building an app, you're in the container game. You can build a great container with no cheap tricks. I have done so! But you can't build a great learning app with no container, and you can't build a great container if you if you don't want to change your users' patterns of engagement and attention. So, what is your container? How will you weave a powerful spell that meaningfully transforms the attention and engagement of the app's user? What will cause them to pull up your app again and again, when they would have churned from a simple anki deck or whatnot? Given that you find it distasteful to use the easy levers you mentioned (notifications, \"streak\" psychology), what alternatives can shift your users' patterns of attention and engagement towards the learning task? If you have great answers to those questions, great! If you don't want to build a container, build content on a platform with easy distribution. If you want to build a container but you don't want to shape your users' attention or engagement, you are confused. reply",

When they realise it was AOE cutscenes, and that the whole project was a backdoor to deliver historical knowledge to people.

Not an app, but the same sort of thing. Some people sell the motivation as the core product, some sell the game as the core product (to deliver motivation) and some people sell the knowledge as the core product. All are valid approaches just make sure you are happy with the market you are targeting. One more thing: I have absolutely no idea how to obtain calm in todays environment. I dont see myself engaging with an app that requires me to be calm ahead of time, but if it somehow strengthened or created a sense of calm that might be a sufficient product differentiator. reply",

Non-subscription without clear gamification and engagement tricks seems like Rosetta Stone basically and that's the longest-running, most effective language learning software I'm aware of. When I joined the Army 18 years ago, while waiting for school assignment, I had the opportunity to train provincial reconstruction teams as a role player and had to cram learn some reasonable level of conversational Pashtun and that was what we used, before smart phones were widely adopted. The only real innovation I've seen since then is conversational LLMs that allow you free-form practice without a human partner, but even back then, scripted conversational practice was pretty good as long as there was a wide enough diversity of scripts. Problem is more along the lines of \"solo developer\" here. Hacker News seems to have a real thing about this niche for whatever reason, but when doing something like this that I think requires real expertise in a wide variety of subjects that aren't software development, I think you need help. There's no way something like Rosetta Stone was developed without the input of experts in language learning and teaching, for instance. Knowing the platforms, programming languages, frameworks, and app store onboarding and delivery processes is already a lot for one person, but expecting to know the target domain on top of that is expecting an awful lot from yourself. I don't think it's a great sign trying to crowdsource business strategy from a free web discussion board, as a single example.

There's certainly a market for \"calm\" learning, though you've already identified the main challenge: there's a smaller larger market for people who want to be educated than entertained, and the market for \"calm education\" is going to be an even smaller subset of that education market. Essentially you're looking for the people who are saying \"I want to be educated, but I'm not looking for the most efficient way to do it. I would prefer to move at a slower pace being driven purely by intrinsic motivation, rather than using extrinsic motivators in order to encourage me to move more quickly\" That market certainly exists, but it's a small enough niche that you'll likely have to be compete at a high price point to be viable. As point of comparison, Mentava costs $500/month, so if I were building a calm learning app (for an even smaller market), I would try to figure out a way justify an even higher price point than Mentava's. reply",

However, I do generally have a distaste for \"gamified\"  learning, and, separately, I feel distracted by things I feel are not very fulfilling, but are addicting (namely, scrolling through news, social media, or videos on my phone). I won't say what you are building is a mistake. But just based on what you described, if I were interested in learning a language through your app, I would not just be comparing it to other language learning apps, but I would also be comparing it to language textbooks/workbooks, classes at a community college or MOOC, or language courses on DVD/CD/YouTube/etc. I guess I think that apps are good at gamifying things, if that were to be a goal. If you are stripping that away, what makes your app unique compared to all those other resources? How does your app replace or supplement other things? And to be clear, I imagine there could be plenty of things that make your app unique! I just would want to know what those things are before diving in. reply",

Learning apps serve huge varieties of markets, with very different needs.

          "text": "I'll give you one example, and you can decide for yourself. Mid of this year, I accidentally found out about a great independent language learning app [1]. It clicked for me. It was no bullshit, no gamification, and no distraction. I used it for one or two months, 700 hours in total. I can attribute to it some progress in learning my target language. Then I went on vacation for a few weeks and completely forgot about it. Today I tried to find it again, but since I forgot its name, I couldn't find it easily. Normally, I would search my inbox, but there was not a single mail from it. When I found it, I learned it improved quite a bit and added a way to support the app through subscriptions. Now, if it had some promotions or gamification built-in, I would be reminded of its existence and would most probably have been using it at least 700 more hours until today, and maybe even subscribed to it. And it would bring me closer to reaching the learning goal in my target language. TL;DR: Yes, some gamification or nagging is necessary. But don't overdo it. [1] https://morpheem.org/ reply",

My goal was to give the user a focused tool (i.e. chat with an AI at your level) and let them experiment & play at their own pace. However, due to the more user-driven approach to this learning method (output-focused, user has to put in effort to chat with the AI and get feedback), there is more friction with using the tool. This isn't necessarily a bad thing - in fact, more friction can lead to more meaningful experiences. That being said, I believe the market will push tools to be low friction and low effort (i.e. gamified apps) that are focused on consumption rather than tools that require more user effort. just my 2c from a fellow builder. if curious, check it out here! would love any feedback https://koucai.chat reply",

Among other things, dopamine is the learning hormone, it is a problem when it makes you learn the wrong things, like \"fentanyl is really great\", or \"I need to buy more stuff I don't need\", but it is also what helps you learn useful skills and life lessons. I remember my father, a teacher, who told me he viewed his job in the classroom as a performance art. His knowledge was secondary, if that's knowledge you want, just read a book, go to the internet, whatever, you don't need a teacher. But it is not very engaging, and a teacher's job is to make it more engaging. So without engagement, you probably won't make a good learning app, but you can make the engagement entirely targeted towards learning and not monetization, which would be a very good thing. reply",

If you don't create an obvious avenue for the user to infer his development, he won't be able to do it. \nYou have to confuse the audience to bring in the sense of progress. \nPeople learn by being challenged, confused, and by building something. Nobody learns by interfacing with an application that promises it. \nBut besides learning nothing, they can feel good about being engaged, by completing tasks, seeing progress bar moving, seeing number go up. \nSomeone that decides to interface with a learning app instead of learning the damn thing is doomed, will never learn anything at all. Just give them a sense of accomplishment so they can feel good about it. Without gamification what would the platform give them? \nIf don't help them cope with their inertia, there really is nothing you could do. \nMaybe you are equating gamification with dark patterns?\nGamification is not necessarily a bad thing. It is a powerful psychological trick. Can definitely be used for good. \nWorking on performance often feels amazing because we can profile, identify clear bottlenecks and work to reduce them. When you manage to make number go down, you have a clear indication something went right. Maybe you didn't absolutely improve de code, but you made it better in a very specific way under a very specific lens. People like it because of this aspect, and it does feel a little bit like a game. There is a clear requirement and a clear specification. The game aspect makes it very enjoyable. \nI suppose development against a test suite provides a similar experience. Feels good in a game-ish way. \nGamification is more related to the feels good than dark patterns, but obviously, the whole industry will ONLY be interested in exploiting practices. There is no incentive to make the user feel good, at all, without being pervasive. \nIf you care about your user, you should design around the user. Inevitably, you will think a bunch about what feels good. \nIf all you care about is the user learning, developing competence, you will offer no platform at all. The platform will tell them to close it and go do the thing.\nIf you want to motivate them, another story. If you want them to feel accomplished, another story.

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I've been on a business trip this week, and sitting on the plane, I was randomly browsing NYT and read this article which really REALLY pissed me off: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/14/us/fire-department-software-private-equity.html?unlocked_article_code=1.8k8.yzeR.NwSK3PTQeXQj&amp;smid=nytcore-android-share<p>TLDR: Private equity is buying up all these software vendors, and preying upon vulnerable fire departments; one rural department with a total budget of $130k/yr saw their software costs go up 3x in one year (from $4k/yr to $12k/yr).<p>I want to do something. I have not worked in the emergency services domain before, so I know that I am naive. I do have experience with oncall and mission-critical software maintenance and highly available/durable services, but when I say mission critical I mean millions-of-dollars at risk, not human lives.<p>I want to solicit HN for very early directional advice, of any and all kinds.<p>- Are there some existing open source projects or foundations with a mission like this, to serve and protect critical services like emergency response?<p>- Is it feasible to build incrementally, i.e. ship small components of incremental value, and would fire departments be open to trying an open source option?<p>- Are there things like certifications or regulatory hurdles, that might be expensive to get?<p>- Does anyone randomly happen to have experience in this industry, and would be willing to write up their perspective?<p>My early initial thesis is something like this: I personally cannot stomach the idea of simply passively \"letting\" private equity invade this aspect of society, to hold emergency services departments and by extension taxpayers hostage. They are essentially extorting and exploiting society's inelastic demand for emergency fucking services. So I don't care about making profit, I only care about actually solving the needs of the emergency departments and of protecting human life (knowing that I am naive still, I definitely do not want to overpromise and put lives at risk). But my personal feelings aside, I do think there is a useful insight here: if useful software can be made reliably and cheaply, by engineers motivated to help their communities  instead of profit (or just to poke private equity in the eye), then ultimately private equity cannot compete against an adversary that doesn't care about profit -- we actually CAN WIN, because eventually they will give up and exit these industries if they see that there is no profit to squeeze.<p>I am looking for like-minded builders. I seriously think the software foundation could simply be a vehicle for early-retirement rich FIREd ex-techies, to add some new purpose in their lives, by using their skills to solve a targeted and well-scoped set of problems.<p>\"Some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned, or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world [NOT] burn [because the fire departments should have cheap reliable emergency services software].\" -- Alfred Pennyworth, The Dark Knight<p>\"Beware the fury of a patient man.\" -- John Dryden<p>I am a patient man, with a newly gained cold fury. I am willing to write code. Or organize a software foundation. Or be an investor/funder for someone else to write the software. Or whatever form of help I can give.<p>Appreciate any and all help or feedback (positive or negative)!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I've been working on a personal project recently, rewriting an old jQuery + Django project into SvelteKit. The main work is translating the UI templates into idiomatic SvelteKit while maintaining the original styling. This includes things like using semantic HTML instead of div-spamming, not wrapping divs in divs in divs, and replacing bootstrap with minimal tailwind. It also includes some logic refactors, to maintain the original functionality but rewritten to avoid years of code debt. Things like replacing templates using boolean flags for multiple views with composable Svelte components.<p>I've had a fairly steady process for doing this: look at each route defined in Django, build out my `+page.server.ts`, and then split each major section of the page into a Svelte component with a matching Storybook story. It takes a lot of time to do this, since I have to ensure I'm not just copying the template but rather recreating it in a more idiomatic style.<p>This kind of work seems like a great use case for AI assisted programming, but I've failed to use it effectively. At most, I can only get Claude Code to recreate some slightly less spaghetti code in Svelte. Simple prompting just isn't able to get AI's code quality within 90% of what I'd write by hand. Ideally, AI could get it's code to something I could review manually in 15-20 minutes, which would massively speed up the time spent on this project (right now it takes me 1-2 hours to properly translate a route).<p>Do you guys have tips or suggestions on how to improve my efficiency and code quality with AI?</p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Hey, Boris from the Claude Code team here. A few tips: 1. If there is anything Claude tends to repeatedly get wrong, not understand, or spend lots of tokens on, put it in your CLAUDE.md. Claude automatically reads this file and it’s a great way to avoid repeating yourself. I add to my team’s CLAUDE.md multiple times a week. 2. Use Plan mode (press shift-tab 2x). Go back and forth with Claude until you like the plan before you let Claude execute. This easily 2-3x’s results for harder tasks. 3. Give the model a way to check its work. For svelte, consider using the Puppeteer MCP server and tell Claude to check its work in the browser. This is another 2-3x. 4. Use Opus 4.5. It’s a step change from Sonnet 4.5 and earlier models. Hope that helps! reply",

For longer projects, have the LLM write down a plan or checklist, and then have it tackle each step in a new conversation. The LLM context collapse happens well before you hit the token limits, and things like ground rules and whatnot stop influencing the LLMs outputs after a couple tens of thousands of tokens in my experience. (Similar guidance goes for writing tools & whatnot - give the LLM exactly and only what it needs back from a tool, don’t try to make it act like a deterministic program. Whether or not they’re capital-I intelligent, they’re pretty fucking stupid.) reply",

You need a feedback loop (we all do). and the best way is for it to change things and see the effects (ideally also against a good baseline like a test suite where it can roughly guage how close or far it is from the goal.) For assembly, a debugger/tracer works great (using batch-mode or scripts as models/tooling often choke on such interactivie TUI io). - If it keeps missing the mark tell it to decorate the code with a file log recording all the info it needs to understand what's happening. Its analysis of such logs normally zeroes the solution pretty quickly, especially for complex tasks. - If it's really struggling, tell it to sketch out a full plan in pseudocode, and explain why that will work, and analyze for any gotchas. Then to analayze the differences between the current implementation and the ideal it just worked out. This often helps get it unblocked. reply",

          "text": "Thank you for Claude Code (Web). Google has a similar offering with Google Jules. I got really, really bad results from Jules and was amazed by Claude Code when I finally discovered it. I compared both with the same set of prompts and Claude Code seemed to be a senior expert developer and Jules, well don't know who be that bad ;-) Anyway, I also wanted to have persistent information, so I don't have to feed Claude Code the same stuff over and over again. I was looking for similar functionality as Claude projects. But that's not available for Claude Code Web. So, I asked Claude what would be a way of achieving pretty the same as projects, and it told me to put all information I wanted to share in a file with the filename:.clinerules. Claude told me I should put that file in the root of my repository. So please help me, is your recommendation the correct way of doing this, or did Claude give the correct answer? Maybe you can clear that up by explaining the difference between the two files? reply",

I have skills for complex tool interactions. Our company has it's own deployment CLI tool so using skills to make Claude Code an expert at using this tool has done wonders to improve Claude Codes performance when working on CI/CD problems. I am currently working on a new slash command /investigate <service> that runs triage for an active or past incident. I've had Claude write tools to interact with all of our partner services (AWS, JIRA, CI/CD pipelines, GitLab, Datadog) and now when an incident occurs it can quickly put together an early analysis of a incident finding the right people to involve (not just owners but people who last touched the service), potential root causes including service dependency investigations.

Explicit is better than implicit.\nSimple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated.\nReadability counts.\nSpecial cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity.\nIf the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. Trust the context you're given. Don't defend against problems the human didn't ask you to solve.\n``` How can I add it as a system prompt (or if its called something else) in vscode so LLMs adhere to it? reply",

Don't get me wrong, AI is at least as game-changing for programming as StackOverflow and Google were back in the day. I use it every day, and it's saved me hours of work for certain specific tasks [2]. But it's simply not a massive 10x force multiplier that some might lead you to believe. I'll start believing when maintainers of complex, actively developed, and widely used open-source projects (e.g. ffmpeg, curl, openssh, sqlite) start raving about a massive uptick in positive contributions, pointing to a concrete influx of high-quality AI-assisted commits.

          "text": "\"Heck, why isn't there a cornucopia of new apps, even trivial ones?\" There is. We had to basically create a new category for them on /r/golang because there was a quite distinct step change near the beginning of this year where suddenly over half the posts to the subreddit were \"I asked my AI to put something together, here's a repo with 4 commits, 3000 lines of code, and an AI-generated README.md. It compiles and I may have even used it once or twice.\" It toned down a bit but it's still half-a-dozen posts a day like that on average. Some of them are at least useful in principle. Some of them are the same sorts of things you'd see twice a month, only now we can see them twice a week if not twice a day. The problem wasn't necessarily the utility or the lack thereof, it was simply the flood of them. It completely disturbed the balance of the subreddit. To the extent that you haven't heard about these, I'd observe that the world already had more apps than you could possibly have ever heard about and the bottleneck was already marketing rather than production. AIs have presumably not successfully done much about helping people market their creations. reply",

I know what you mean, but the thing I find windsurf (which we moved to from copilot) most useful (except writing opeanapi spec files) is asking it questions about the codebase. Just random minutiae that I could find by grepping or following the code, but would take me more than the 30s-1m it takes it. For reference, this is a monorepo of a bit over 1M LoC (and 800k YAML files, because, did I mention I hate API specs?), so not really a small code base either. > I will break down the tasks to the same size as if I was implementing it. But instead of doing it myself, I roughly describe the task on a technical level (and add relevant classes to the context) and it will ask me clarifying questions. After 2-3 rounds the plan usually looks good and I let it implement the task. Here I disagree, sort of. I almost never ask it to do complex tasks, the most time consuming and hardest part is not actually typing out the code, describing it to an AI takes me almost as much time as implementing for most things. One thing I did find very useful is the supertab feature of windsurf, which, at a high level, looks at the changes you started making and starts suggesting the next change. And it's not only limited to repetitive things (like . in vi), if you start adding a parameter to a function, it starts adding it to the docs, to the functions you need below, and starts implementing it. > For me this method allows me to focus on the architecture and overall structure and delegate the plumbing to Copilot.

As an example, one task of the feature was to add metrics for observability when the new action was executed. Another when it failed. My prompt: Create a new metric \"foo.bar\" in MyMetrics when MyService.action was successful and \"foo.bar.failed\" when it failed. I review the plan and let it implement it. As you can see it's a small task and after it is done I review the changes and commit them. Rinse and repeat. I think the biggest issue is that people try to one shot big features or applications. But it is much more efficient to me to treat Copilot as a smart pair programming partner. There you also think about and implement one task after the other. reply",

This is the norm now in the SV startup world at least. You don't just YOLO it. You do extensive planning when features are complex, and you review output carefully. The thing is, if the agent isn't getting it to the point where you feel like you might need to drop down and edit manually, agents are now good enough to do those same \"manual edits\" with nearly 100% reliability if you are specific enough about what you want to do. Instead of \"build me x, y, z\", you can tell it to rename variables, restructure functions, write specific tests, move files around, and so on. So the question isn't so much whether to use an agent or edit code manually—it's what level of detail you work at with the agent. There are still times where it's easier to do things manually, but you never really need to. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Here’s how we’re working with LLMs at my startup.<p>We have a monorepo with scheduled Python data workflows, two Next.js apps, and a small engineering team. We use GitHub for SCM and CI/CD, deploy to GCP and Vercel, and lean heavily on automation.<p>Local development:\nEvery engineer gets Cursor Pro (plus Bugbot), Gemini Pro, OpenAI Pro, and optionally Claude Pro. We don’t really care which model people use. In practice, LLMs are worth about 1.5 excellent junior/mid-level engineers per engineer, so paying for multiple models is easily worth it.<p>We rely heavily on pre-commit hooks: ty, ruff, TypeScript checks, tests across all languages, formatting, and other guards. Everything is auto-formatted. LLMs make types and tests much easier to write, though complex typing still needs some hand-holding.<p>GitHub + Copilot workflow:\nWe pay for GitHub Enterprise primarily because it allows assigning issues to Copilot, which then opens a PR. Our rule is simple: if you open an issue, you assign it to Copilot. Every issue gets a code attempt attached to it.<p>There’s no stigma around lots of PRs. We frequently delete ones we don’t use.<p>We use Turborepo for the monorepo and are fully uv on the Python side.<p>All coding practices are encoded in .cursor/rules files. For example: “If you are doing database work, only edit Drizzle’s schema.ts and don’t hand-write SQL.” Cursor generally respects this, but other tools struggle to consistently read or follow these rules no matter how many agent.md-style files we add.<p>My personal dev loop:\nIf I’m on the go and see a bug or have an idea, I open a GitHub issue (via Slack, mobile, or web) and assign it to Copilot. Sometimes the issue is detailed; sometimes a single sentence. Copilot opens a PR, and I review it later.<p>If I’m at the keyboard, I start in Cursor as an agent in a Git worktree, using whatever the best model is. I iterate until I’m happy, ask the LLM to write tests, review everything, and push to GitHub. Before a human review, I let Cursor Bugbot, Copilot, and GitHub CodeQL review the code, and ask Copilot to fix anything they flag.<p>Things that are still painful:\nTo really know if code works, I need to run Temporal, two Next.js apps, several Python workers, and a Node worker. Some of this is Dockerized, some isn’t. Then I need a browser to run manual checks.<p>AFAICT, there’s no service that lets me: give a prompt, write the code, spin up all this infra, run Playwright, handle database migrations, and let me manually poke at the system. We approximate this with GitHub Actions, but that doesn’t help with manual verification or DB work.<p>Copilot doesn’t let you choose a model when assigning an issue or during code review. The model it uses is generally bad. You can pick a model in Copilot chat, but not in issues, PRs or reviews.<p>Cursor + worktrees + agents suck. Worktrees clone from the source repo including unstaged files, so if you want a clean agent environment, your main repo has to be clean. At times it feels simpler to just clone the repo into a new directory instead of using worktrees.<p>What’s working well:\nBecause we constantly spin up agents, our monorepo setup scripts are well-tested and reliable. They also translate cleanly into CI/CD.<p>Roughly 25% of “open issue → Copilot PR” results are mergeable as-is. That’s not amazing, but better than zero, and it gets to ~50% with a few comments. This would be higher if Copilot followed our setup instructions more reliably or let us use stronger models.<p>Overall, for roughly $1k/month, we’re getting the equivalent of 1.5 additional junior/mid engineers per engineer. Those “LLM engineers” always write tests, follow standards, produce good commit messages, and work 24/7. There’s friction in reviewing and context-switching across agents, but it’s manageable.<p>What are you doing for vibe coding in a production system?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Interesting. I treat VScode Copilot as a junior-ish pair programmer, and get really good results for function implementations. Walking it through the plan in smaller steps, noting that we’ll build up to the end state in advance ie. “first let’s implement attribute x, then we’ll add filtering for x later”, and explicitly using planning modes and prompts - these all allow me to go much faster, have good understanding of how the code works, and produce much higher quality (tests, documentation, commit messages) work. I feel like, if a prompt for a function implementation doesn’t produce something reasonable, then it should be broken down further. I don’t know how others define “vibe-coding”, but this feels like a lower-level approach. On the times I’ve tried automating more, letting the models run longer, I haven’t liked the results. I’m not interested in going more hands-free yet. reply",

          "text": "Your setup is interesting. I’ve had my mind on this space for a while now but haven’t done any deep work on a setup that optimizes the things I’m interested in. I think at a fundamental level, I expect we can produce higher quality software under budget. And I really liked how you were clearly thinking about cost benefits especially in your setup. I’ve encountered far too many developers that just want to avoid as much cognitive work as possible. Too many junior and mid devs also are more interested in doing as they are told instead of thinking about the problem for themselves. For the most part, in my part of the world at least, junior and mid-level devs can indeed be replaced by a claude code max subscription of around $200 per month and you’d probably get more done in a week than four such devs that basically end up using an llm to do work that they might not even thoroughly explore. So in my mind I’ve been thinking a lot about all aspects of the Software Development LifeCycle that could be improved using some llm or sorts. ## Requirements. How can we use llms to not only organize requirements but to strip them down into executable units of work that are sequenced in a way that makes sense. How do we go further to integrate an llm into our software development processes - be it a sprint or whatever. In a lot of green field projects, after designing the core components of the system, we now need to create tasks, group them, sequence them and work out how we go about assigning them and reviewing and updating various boards or issue trackers or whatever. There is a lot of gruntwork involved in this. I’ve seen people use mcps to automatically create tasks in some of these issue trackers based on some pdf of the requirements together with a design document. ## Code Review - I effectively spend 40% of my time reviewing code written by other developers and I mostly fix the issues I consider “minor” - which is about 60% of the time. I could really spend less time reviewing code with the help of an llm code reviewer that simply does a “first pass” to at least give me an idea of where to spend more of my time - like on things that are more nuanced. ## Software Design - This is tricky. Chatbots will probably lie to you if you are not a domain expert. You mostly use them to diagnose your designs and point out potential problems with your design that someone else would’ve seen if they were also domain experts in whatever you were building. We can explore a lot of alternate approaches generated by llms and improve them. ## Bugfixes - This is probably a big win for llms’ because there used to be a platform where I used to be able to get $50s and $30s to fix github bugs - that have now almost entirely been outsourced to llms. For me to have lost revenue in that space was the biggest sign of the usefulness of llms I got in practice. After a typical greenfield project has been worked on for about two months, bugs start creeping in. For apps that were properly architected, I expect these bugs to be fixable by existing patterns throughout the codebase. Be it removing a custom implementation to use a shared utility or other or simply using the design systems colors instead of a custom hardcoded one. In fact for most bugs - llms can probably get you about 50% of the way most of the time. ## Writing actual (PLUMBING) code . This is often not as much of a bottleneck as most would like to think but it helps when developers don’t have to do a lot of the grunt-work involved in creating source files, following conventions in a codebase, creating boilerplates and moving things around. This is an incredible use of llms that is hardly mentioned because it is not that “hot”. ## Testing - In most of the projects we worked on at a consulting firm, writing tests - whether ui or api was never part of the agreement because of the economics of most of our gigs. And the clients never really cared because all they wanted was working software. For a developing firm however, testing can be immense especially when using llms. It can provide guardrails to check when a model is doing something it wasn’t asked to do. And can also be used to create and enforce system boundaries especially in pseudo type systems like Typescript where JavaScript’s escape hatches may be used as a loophole. ## DEVOPS. I remember there was a time we used to manually invalidate cloudfront distributions after deploying our ui build to some e3 bucket. We’ve subsequently added a pipeline stage to invalidate the distribution. But I expect there are lots of grunt devops work that could really be delegated. Of course, this is a very scary use of llms but I daresay - we can find ways to use it safely ## OBSERVABILITY - a lot of observability platforms already have this feature where llms are able to review error logs that are ingested, diagnose the issue, create an issue on github or Jira (or wherever), create a draft PR, review, test it in some container, iterate on a solution X times, notify someone to review and so on and so forth. Some llms on this observability platform also attach a level of priority and dispatch messages to relevant developers or teams. LLms in this loop simply supercharge the whole observability/instrumentation of production applications But yeah, that is just my two cents. I don’t have any answers yet I just ponder on this every now and then at a keyboard. reply",

Zelensky will be replaced as Ukraine's leader and Ukraine as a whole will switch back to Russian control, moving the new front line to other former Soviet states and Poland. Also, all of the weapons provided to Ukraine will begin pointing at Europe instead of Russia China will begin blockading the islands around Taiwan, leading to a blockade of Taiwan itself. Odds are there will be a peaceful reunification with China instead of a war. Maduro will be overthrown in Venezuela and is all being used as leverage by the U.S. in its negotiations with China and Russia The GOP will retain control over the House in the upcoming Midterms A large labor reduction in many high paying jobs, such as tech, due to higher productivity provided by AI. In normal times, this would cause a kind of deflation to balance everything out. Due to the pending economic crisis, the Govt will spend even more money to try to maintain the current system, leading to more inflation. The cost to service the current debt will be used to justify a large reduction in Federal Govt agencies and services. The Atlas comet will not be an alien spacecraft The public will learn more about the extensive surveillance state and be less approving of it. The Epstein files will be a big nothing burger. reply",

Parents will use them, while telling their kinds not to do so.

S&P 500 grinds out another double digit year, mostly because earnings keep up and alternatives still look worse. Tech discourse stays apocalyptic, but balance sheets don't.

I really feel \"web dev\" is going to get highly commoditized by GenAI, by web dev I mean 99% of building CRUD-adjacent apps, we are already seeing it now with tools like Claude Code etc, this pipeline is just going to get more refined, with tigther testing feedback loops, PR-workflows and a CI/CD deployment pipeline which the GenAI will control. This might be amplified by the fact the sheer amount of tested, high quality there is in the JavaScript-ecosystem for the AI to train on and learn from. Software engineering in general will tend more systems and embedded software, fields where GenAI can't perform well or can't be trusted to produce good code (I am thinking writing device drivers, or maintainence of legacy C applications) as well as deep research fields. The average software engineering job might be either that of a \"technical product manager\", or \"researcher\" or \"low-level systems expert\" That's just what I feel. Honestly, I am probably much younger an others on this forum, so I haven't really seen this industry \"evolve\" this is just how it looks to me now. I believe there was a time in the early 2010s where there was a boom of this \"generalist developer\" where if you knew your JavaScript-ecosystem (or App Dev ecosystem for that matter) pretty well, you could land a pretty decent job right out of college, or without a college degree at all. To me, at this stage the world in general needs software engineers who understand the \"world\" if that makes sense (in terms of physics, mathematics), or who have a really good mental model of computation. Better put, software engineering will become a tool in the larger context of research & development of tech that advance humanity. reply",

I have observed many roles like SRE etc, require certain experience which is hard to get by working on your own projects without much traction; similiar case for cybersec but to a lesser extent.

Yes that's true but I would argue this isn't because of AI itself. Sure it might have accelerated it but I have heard that in the 2020's a lot of people got a lot of jobs in the industry and then its that the market did feel saturated and in a sense, a lot of jobs feel this way in the economy where if someone has it, they continue having it but its becoming harder for new people to enter, there are financials reasons for this too mostly if i remember, interests rates are one of the core reasons That being said, Even though I have used LLM's a lot, I do not agree with your opinion and I am even younger than you most likely (17) A lot of people my age/people just going into college would use AI a lot to cheat but I will genuinely try to take it slow to learn things. I will try to use it as a learning tool and not as a crutch. Currently I am still in high school and I get ideas which I wish to implement but dont have the time because of exams so I test them out with LLM's but even I find the whole process frustrating at times and its just, maybe its me but there is a good ceiling that I can process. Some basic crud processes can definitely be in that but if your project is novel, even basic things can be hard I will give you an example, I recently tried creating an api for proton docs which worked by having browser instances. I had two basic scripts that worked on one platform and converted them to puppeteer using LLM and after it worked, I then asked it to simply create a very basic crud api on top of it Nope, I tried it 5-6 times on the best models on the market but they couldn't actively take two files which had read/write and have it work, either there was an issue in read or an issue in write I am fine with the project as it is right now and I am fine with the templates it has given me and I am going to build it now on top of it I had many ideas which could be considered basic crud apps like having a kanban app/github issues like ui on top of bitwarden after I saw a post here by simon saying how he uses github issues and that went semi-viral on hackernews Another issue is that I think just as how sure writers and similar can generate AI generated, I feel like there would be more trust on the non AI generated code. Personally I will try my best to create prototypes with AI and if I like them, I will see what it does and then rewrite them myself as an learning experience and also because people say spec driven development etc. but I just want to code things by hand at this point or convert the LLM generated prototypes of idea to something that I later code and understand by hand tbh (most likely when I get into college) reply",

          "text": "I wrote a lot. Let me add a tldr: any international trades happening in non-US dollar is an \"acceleration\" of dedollarizatiom, given that currently all trade is dollarized. Original: I don't known if I understand the spirit of the question. There are no metrics or tracking of how \"dollarized\" the international economy is because virtually all trade is done in dollars and there has been no risk of this changing for the past ?65? years My original prediction for 2026 ( not 2025, mind you) made in 2024 was based on a few factors, if I recall correctly, 1) the Russia-Ucraine war and related sanctions; 2) the open discussion in BRICS about trade in direct currencies; and 3) the then-promised isolatonist policies of Trump's second mandate. What we've seen in 2025 makes all of those stronger I guess. 1) I don't know the status of the Russia-Ucraine war; all I know is it is a glaring sign of the end of Pax Americana (as is the Israel-Palestine genocide/war, by the way, which the US would -not- have allowed given the strong internal opposition and negative popularity among the American public). So sanctions of Russia notwistanding, that status quo, which strongly related to dollar as reserve currency, is either agonizing or dead. 2) Trump and the US attempted a very strong response to the (first ever?) trades in local currency between Brazil and China, mostly in the form of targeted tariffs (all discourse about Bolsonaro and whatever being the motivation for tariffing Brazilian imports being, in my opinion, political smoke and mirrors). I don't think it worked. I think BRICS might press on this. If the mercosur/EU trade deal goes through it will also be a strong force towards trade in Euros/Reais/Pesos directly I believe. 3) I don't think I need to clarify; tariffs and other issues brought on by the current US government were severely negative to the placement of the US as a preferred trade partner. This is to beyond economic choice; active anti-american sentiment are at all times high in countries like Canada, Denmark, and Mexico, all historically aligned with the US. This may not seem that relevant but come election cycles in those and other countries we might see platforms/candidates that openly propose to \"secede\" from the US hegemony international order. If that happens, removing US military bases is a first go. Alternatives to the US \"petrodollar\" a close second. reply",

I looked up the Ford F-150 Lightning and a quote catches my eye: \"When the electric truck debuted in 2022, Russia had just invaded Ukraine, disrupting supplies of nickel, a key material in EV batteries.\" Raw materials and cost is a big part of the Chinese dominance on EVs and it'll continue to be on that side of the political sphere. Having to tariff China also emphasizes that they're gaining ground too quickly. They process about (over?) 80% of the major parts, so you can't fully tariff them either, only assembled cars or some parts. reply",

I really want to help my user, but I don't like this code in my codebase. If you don’t want to accept the PR, don’t. It’s still your project. Reject it politely. Tell them why you don’t feel comfortable accepting it (too many changes at once; impractical to review; general distrust of LLM code; …) but remind them that “of course, if you want to keep that in your own fork, you’re more than welcome”. I’ve been doing that for years (way before vibe coding was a thing) and was always able to keep good relations with my users. Be polite and make sure they understand your rejection is not an indictment on their submission, while reassuring them that the effort was not wasted because they can keep it for their own use if they really want it that bad. > This morning, I received another message from another user who is about to submit one more feature.

But, because it's a telco, that will be annoying and hidden. UK: OFCOM are phasing out the fax support requirement https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-and-broadband/telecoms-infra... (I slightly balked at the $5 initial price, but then realized: this is a desperation fee and I think for a lot of the users a clear fee for a clear one off service is the best deal. Anyone who wants to send 1,000 faxes will (a) be in the top 1% of fax users in their country if it's not Japan and (b) make their own arrangements. Also patio11's \"charge more\") Software wise, if you have a PBX line (which the telco will change for) you can run Asterix and then https://www.asterisk.org/products/add-ons/fax-for-asterisk/ to send as many faxes as you like to the other person in your country with a fax machine. reply",

Looking around your website it seems to me that there's very large attendance, which in my mind means generally less focus on the food itself. Do you think one of the main factors is meeting new people/the sense of community? Anyway good job! I'm not sure what your margins are but it's probably more than 500/month! Congrats! reply",

I’m just going to bullet some of them out in no particular order: - We do the work to find the restaurant and curate a menu, story, and theme. E.g., we might go to an Indian restaurant and focus the event on only the southern regional dishes. - Many times we have dishes that are off menu specially for our event. - Sense of community. We have quite a few regulars who have gotten to know each other. In 2025, 45 people reached their 20th or 30th event with us. Since we take over the whole restaurant there’s a little more freedom in how the space is used. Lots of new friendships have been forged. - When you go to a restaurant with a friend or small group, you can only order so much. We’ve had events with upwards of 25 different bites. There’s really no better way to sample everything the restaurant has to offer. - There’s a few people who say their partner are picky eaters, so they come to our event each month to have the opportunity to be a bit more adventurous. It’s an incredibly diverse group with a lot of different reasons to attend. reply",

Then contact some restaurants that fit the criteria and pitch them the event. That kicks off the back and forth on cost and menu. Around 4 weeks before the event we send a save the date + previous event recap email. We summarize the last event and tease the next event, without giving away the actual resturant or type of food. Over the next week we prep the invite email and payment forms. This requires putting the dishes on our menu template, research and writing about the history of the dishes, the region, and the resturant. Some of this content also goes onto our website. Three weeks out we send the invite, which is a lottery system. Members have 5 days to request a seat and place a credit card hold. 5 days later we run the lottery (I wrote some basic software to randomize assignment, conver the card auth to capture and release any cards that didn't get assigned a ticket). Then we send an email to everyone who got in with which night they recieved and another email to anyone who was waitlisted. Everyone is added to a spreadsheet to track. 1 week before the event we send a reminder email and a last chance to cancel before the ticket is non refundable. At the event we play host and check each guest in and say hi to everyone. Then we give a prepared ~5 min intro about the food, restaurant, celebrate any milestone members, and make any general house keeping accounments. Our 20 club members get a branded apron. At the event we take video and pictures. Over the course of the next 4 weeks we post dish pictures with descriptions and history of the dish on our instagram. We also make a 1-2 min recap video of the event which also goes on our instagram and website. Separate from the actual event related work we have to manage the books, handle members emails, and review membership requests. More recently we started selling shirts, so there's a little work in managing that as well. reply",

From there people started to tell their friends, who told others, then the local newspaper wrote about us, and people started talking about us on Facebook food groups and posting on Instagram. The community grew very organically, we never spent a penny on marketing. Most of the original 13 don’t come anymore, and we have grown into an incredibly diverse community.

We credit that with the transition from 1 or 2 degrees of separation to people we had no connection to. - There’s been a few influencers who have shown up and documented their experience.

We also have an unbelievably respectful and mature community. After over 70 seatings we’ve never had an incident. We also have a code of conduct document we send all new members. Second, we setup an LLC to shield us personally from legal liability. Third, not to say that it shields us, but the restaurants also have insurance and are a better target for a lawsuit.

          "text": "There's a really awesome site called Librivox [1], where volunteers narrate books that are in the public domain. Those recordings are also in the public domain as well (this is just part of the Librivox thing). The quality of those recordings (both the narration, and the actual recording quality) varies quite a bit and most of them aren't at a quality I'd expect people to pay for and thus aren't useable for me. I've spent hours and hours sorting through those recordings finding the best ones (from a narration perspective) and then improving the recording/audio quality on them. Those recordings have all mostly been made in the last 20yrs, so they're not old recordings of the books. So, the value I add to the Librivox recordings are: curation/selection, audio enhancement, and a much better delivery mechanism (IMHO). I'm also simultaneously building out our own library of original audio content by working with voice actors to get them recorded and proof read (this is a very expensive and time consuming process, but also very fun). One of the hardest parts is honestly the proofing process. Once I get finished narration files I have to compare them result with the actual script (as there are always mistakes) and request edits. I use whisper.cpp to transcribe them and then git and a few other scripts to compare the transcript with the actual book text. I'll also add that I _do not_ use AI Audio narration because it just doesn't sound good IMHO, and I personally hate listening to it. I regularly run experiments to see what the current state of the tech is and it's still pretty far from where it needs to be IMO. I also don't love the idea of AI swallowing absolutely everything. I appreciate the feedback and compliment! [1] https://librivox.org/ reply",

The compute would differ, but loading speed shouldn't be an issue if you can render the HTML first, and hydrate it after page load. This static HTML would then also serve as fallback when Javascript is disabled. - For a quick demo, I doubt you will lose people by embedding an older version. Serving a version of a few months ago seems like 80% of the work, with 20% of the effort, in terms of deployment. Anyhow, nice to see government funds put to a good cause! reply",

          "text": "Here’s my own side project that’s been earning a bit on the side: I built DedupX, a macOS app for finding duplicate and visually similar files fast - especially useful for photographers and anyone with big local storage collections. What it does - Exact duplicate detection using incremental hashing so it doesn’t have to fully load huge files. - Perceptual image matching finds similar images even if they’re resized or lightly edited (not just byte-for-byte duplicates). - Native macOS integration with a Finder right-click scan. Why I built it: My brother kept running out of space because of tons of photos, and every existing tool I tried either missed similar images or was slow and clunky - so I spent a couple of weekends building something that felt fast, accurate, and native. Business side - Free trial (no CC required). - Paid tiers: ~$5.99/yr or ~$16.99 lifetime. Got positive feedback and 100+ paying users shortly after launch. Been growing steadily ever since.

They can order their hot chocolate and their coffee as if they were going to grab something at a fancy café downtown, but instead it's at home and I'm the barista. It is quite nice to have for when my wife comes back from work and want something specific, or when we are waiting for the visit of a few friend, they can order exactly the available beverages and everything is ready when they're here. It was also a good playground for me to implement Web Push notifications (to never miss new orders). It's a basic Nuxt 3 app with Appwrite as the backend with rough edges, but much enough for our household use !

          "text": "I'm working on porting KiCad to the browser. It's a lot of sweat and tears, multithreading issues and some more sweat. I've updated a port of WxWidgets and now I support all the features KiCad needs with ~200 tests. Right now I have a build that loads in the browser, but I really want to have \"multithreading\" which means workers in the web. One can use asyncify with emscripten to translate blocking C++ to WASM, but that transition is not perfect, right now I'm debugging a bug where there's a race condition that halts all execution and the main thread runs in an infinite loop waiting for the workers to stand up. I guess I'll have a few of those ahead. The main goal is to 1. just have fun 2. use yjs as a collab backend so multiple people can edit the same PCB. This will probably work with pcbnew, KiCad's layout editor, since it has a plugin system and AFAIK I can do the sync layer there. For the rest ( schematic, component editor etc. ) I'll have to figure out something..\nKiCad does not sync automatically if you modify a file, I'll have to do some lifting there. Anyway, it's a lot of fun, I really want this thing to exist, I'm hoping that I won't run into a \"wellll, this is just not going to work\" kind of issue in the end. reply",

          "text": "On the subject of whisper being great... A few weeks ago a co-worker commented about the difficulty he'd had editing a work demo, I pointed at various jump-cutting tools that had automated what he did in the past (editing out silences). But I'd also wanted to play with whisper for a while... So a couple of hours later I'd written a script that does transcription based editing: on the first pass it grabs a timestamped transcript and a plain text transcript for editing; you edit the words into any order you like and a second pass reassembles the video (it's just a couple of hundred lines of python wrapping whisper and ffmpeg). It also speeds up 4x any silences detected that sit within retained sequences in the video. Matching up transcripts turns out to be not that hard; I normalise the text, split it, and then compare to the sequence of normalised words from the timestamped transcript. I find the longest common sequence, keep that, then recurse on the before/after sections (there's a little more detail, but not much). I also sent the transcription to ffmpeg to burn in as captions, because sometimes it makes the audio choppy and the captions make it easier to follow. I know, tools have been doing this for years now. I just didn't have one to hand, and now I do, and I couldn't have done this without whisper. reply",

I’ve never met anyone who can clearly explain how it works in practice. Not just the rules, but the dynamics: what’s repeatable, what’s luck, and what actually matters.<p>By using the Kevin Bacon-number idea: I can usually get within three degrees of separation of well-known technologists like Linus Torvalds, but I can’t seem to get within three steps of someone who confidently understands how HN works.<p>So I’m asking sincerely:\nDoes anyone here feel they understand Hacker News?\nIf so, what are the real levers, and what do people consistently misunderstand?<p>PS: This question comes from a mix of genuine curiosity and personal frustration. I’m honestly trying to understand how HN works in practice.</p></p></p></p></div>",

I've made friends here, have been helped by people on projects that I was busy with, did the reverse, found friends and business partners and spend way too much time. HN is a very interesting slice of the online world, a place that is unlike the rest, sometimes a bit dry but always interesting and extremely useful. If you're looking at it to try to understand it then you might as well try to understand a rat or a mouse. You won't understand it because it isn't there to be understood, it just is, like any other organism. The root of HN is a thing called 'startup news', that was changed very quickly and since then HN has been a focal point for techies of all sorts but also lots of other people from all walks of life and from a large variety of countries. It isn't 'one thing' to everybody that participates, just like a hammer is a different thing for a carpenter than it is for a masoner or a farmer. The fact that after being a member for a couple of years you have this question indicates a lack of participation, not a lack of understanding. reply",

          "text": "> Hacker news is there to promote ycombinator companies I should probably clarify this a bit. It's true that HN sponsors Launch HNs (and Show HNs) by YC startups. This is in the FAQ: https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html . However, YC would not be funding HN if that were the only reason for it. It's a secondary factor. Far more important than promoting existing startups is attracting founders who might start new startups. This requires an entirely different strategy than promotion: it requires being interesting enough to attract the right kind of users. That's why the site is organized around curiosity, as I explained elsewhere in the current thread ( https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46309399 ). For more on this, here are past explanations: optimizing for curiosity - https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&sor... relationship between HN and YC's business interests - https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=false&so... reply",

We literally give exactly the same information and help to YC-funded startups as we do to non-YC-funded startups who ask for assistance with their Show HNs. That's because giving “extra help” to YC-funded startups is far less valuable (to everyone including the startup themselves [1]) than just making HN interesting to readers and showcasing cool projects, no matter who has built them. [1] More than almost anything else, what I've learned from moderating HN is that “extra help” to get onto the front page of HN is of barely any help at all. That is, if the post isn't interesting enough to earn significant numbers of upvotes and good comments very quickly, it will disappear off the front page very quickly. Also, any time a story is on the front page that the community doesn’t think belongs there, it feels off and attracts flags and complaints. reply",

Everything has a cost. For the web, that's typically monetary or your data and attention to advertisers. I think you're right that the cost of Hacker News is that my participation is lending some (tiny incremental) legitimacy to Y Combinator. It's also costing some tiny amount of my attention, in the sense that I may not have heard of Y Combinator if it weren't for Hacker News. For me personally, that is absolutely fine – but I'm glad you made it explicit so that it's a conscious choice.

Building something great that brings people back day after day maybe has the result that it can also serve as a promotional tool - but that’s a bonus, not necessarily a purpose. I’m not the person you asked the question of - but I think the purpose of ycombinator is to give relevant people a place to discuss things aligned with the ecosystem in which ycombinator operates, to help strengthen and champion that ecosystem.

If we take what he wrote at face value, I don’t think the purpose was primarily its promotional value. https://paulgraham.com/hackernews.html _ Hacker News was two years old last week. Initially it was supposed to be a side project—an application to sharpen Arc on, and a place for current and future Y Combinator founders to exchange news._ _ Hacker News is an experiment, and an experiment in a very young field. Sites of this type are only a few years old. Internet conversation generally is only a few decades old. So we've probably only discovered a fraction of what we eventually will._ _ Hacker News is definitely useful. I've learned a lot from things I've read on HN. I've written several essays that began as comments there. So I wouldn't want the site to go away. But I would like to be sure it's not a net drag on productivity. What a disaster that would be, to attract thousands of smart people to a site that caused them to waste lots of time._ reply",

The reason why HN is so much better than other fora (IMO) is that the mods don't allow lever-pulling and astroturfing to overtake regular contributions. Yet it's also popular, so you're bound to get some activity on most posts. Sure, it can be frustrating if you're trying to promote a product or farm karma on posts. But the fact that mostly nobody cares about karma means that you can post something and have it be evaluated on its technical, economic, social merits. Obviously, there are caveats to this - i.e., anything US- and FAANG-related is bound to get much more activity than otherwise - but the overall atmosphere of HN is refreshing compared to Reddit. reply",

          "text": "I can't know for sure. For me, it's just the \"eyeball method\" of comparing HN and different subreddits on Reddit. As to how I (or anyone) could show this, here are a few example questions: 1. How many examples of stealthy but otherwise blatant promotion do you see in the comments? Not every astroturfing campaign will be successful or original, so you'd be able to notice some patterns. Plus, HN is already commercially oriented, and there's the \"Show HN\" option, so it reduces the incentives for astroturfing. 2. Alternatively, how much controversy is there around the specific type of forum? For some subreddits, for example, you'd be able to see counter-subreddits popping up when participants feel the mods are abusing their power to promote one type of opinion. 3. Is a certain type of political/brand-related opinion or interpretation always at the top of your comment feed? For example, if upvotes determine the order of the comments, do you consistently see fewer critical comments on things that you'd expect the community to react to in different ways. 4. Do you consistently see some contributors having more power in discussions over others? Other than the mods, obviously. If this is the case, karma (i.e., number of upvotes) often has more value. Still, I could be wrong. reply",

          "text": "(I'm a mod here) It's true that this place can be cryptic, and that has downsides—specifically, it can be confusing to newcomers, even to some newcomers who would make ideal HN users. That sucks. But there's a key that unlocks most of the puzzles. That is to understand that we're optimizing for exactly one thing: curiosity. (Specifically, intellectual curiosity, since there are other kinds of curiosity too.) Here are links to past explanations about that: https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&sor... We try to elevate things that gratify curiosity: creative work, surprising discoveries, deep dives, technical achievements, unusual personal experience, whimsical unpredictability, good conversation, etc. And we try to demote things that run against curiosity, especially repetition, indignation, sensationalism, and promotion. It gets complicated because you'll also see plenty of repetition, indignation, sensationalism, and promotion on HN—alas! This is the internet after all. But the site survives because the balance of these things stays within tolerable ranges, thanks to two factors: an active community which cares greatly about preserving this place for intended purpose ( https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html ); and an owner (Y Combinator) that pays us to work on the site full time and mainly just wants us to keep it good, to the extent possible. If you really want to figure this place out, the way to do it is as a reader . Hang out on the site, look at the mix of articles that make the frontpage, spend time in the discussion threads (hopefully the interesting sectors and not the flamey ones!), and over time your eyes will adjust. What doesn't work—and this is good because we want it not to work—is approaching HN as a platform for promoting content. If you (<-- I don't mean you personally, but anyone) mainly care about \"how can I use this thing to get attention for my startup/blog/project/newsletter\", then you're operating in 'push' mode rather than 'pull' mode (or 'idle' mode, which is even better). In that case you won't be curious because you're too focused on what you're wanting for extraneous reasons—and if you aren't in a state of curiosity, this place won't make sense. At least we hope it won't! reply",

Honestly hackernews to me is a place where tinkering as a hobby is appreciated. I have read so many large threads here and ended up sometimes having a new point of view on something and so many posts here which make me want to be curious and tinker around too. I cannot really name something exactly which clicks on hackernews but that is what makes it unique and this does mean I cannot explain it to others sometimes since my hobbies are tangential to hackernews too, I just end up saying my hobby is tinkering with computers (currently only software) reply",

It's all the same arguments over and over, most of them without a shred of evidence. It feels like people aren't arguing in good faith any more, we're all just screaming our politics at (or past) each other. This didn't use to be the case.

There’s a handful of ideas we’re collectively mulling over at any given time. They slowly rotate in and out, and modulate into different keys as they go. For instance, the leading edge of LLM related discourse seems to be improving now that we’re getting bored with both hype and outrage, although there’s still plenty of hype and outrage. Old topics still occasionally blip into focus, but they don’t have the same staying power. Like, you’ll see a Rails post every now and then, but it’s not the darling it was. I doubt we’ll ever see the likes of “Rails is a Ghetto” make the rounds again, because nobody’s worked up about it any more. Or take Skrillex, who must have been on the front page every week for a month. I was annoyed at the time, but I think we’re due for a retrospective on programmers and dubstep. I’m not the one to write it though; not my scene in the first place. Anyway, thank you dang for your moderation! reply",

So then you most an Ask HN like \"can anyone help me to understand why people do X\" followed by a few sentences of your thoughts, then at the end say \"I've been working on a service to help with this but we don't seem to be getting much to traction, here's a link\". Another approach would be \"nerd sniping\". Post your site but don't mention anything about what it's for and instead say \"I'm having a problem with SSR rendering with NextJS on my site\" or something like that.

More sneaky would be answering the question with the recommendation from a different account in a way to promote your service and have that upvoted, but that requires more effort and skill I assume. But in general yes, this community definitely can also be manipulated, but I would say it is one of the hardest to fool. The standard mentality here I actually would rather describe as critical instead of curious, but there is just lots of garbage being pushed and also my curiosity is limited. reply",

          "text": "Named ranges! Also newer Excel versions provide you the LET function, which is neat for documentation (naming) of intermediate steps: =LET(data; F4:F34;\n       dummy1; \"This is a made up average function; this string is ignored\";\n       dummy2; \"one limitation is that you cant really overwrite variable names\";\n       tally; COUNTA(data);\n       total; SUM(data);\n       total/tally) It also avoids recomputing intermediate stuff. You can also encapsulate things in a LAMBDA anonymous function: =LET(data; F4:F34;\n       mymeanfunction; LAMBDA(data;\n                              LET(tally; COUNTA(data);\n                                  total; SUM(data);\n                                  total/tally));\n       mean1; mymeanfunction(data);\n       mean2; mymeanfunction(OFFSET(data;0;1));doc;\"FIXME, this should have its own variable name to refer explicitly to G4:G34\";\n       AVERAGE(mean1;mean2)) You could also move the LAMBDA to the name registry and use that function similarly to how you would use a named range or a built-in formula! Coming from a lisp background, I was ecstatic to see this, but they have heavy technical limitations. I did play a little bit though with these concepts and the dynamic array functions. Fun functions to explore: - DROP, TAKE, CHOOSECOLS, CHOOSEROWS to cut arrays\n  - INDEX, OFFSET, COLUMN, ROW to navigate\n  - WRAPCOLS, WRAPROWS, TOROW, TOCOL, VSTACK, HSTACK, TRANSPOSE to shape arrays\n  - MAP, SCAN, REDUCE to compute on top of arrays There's more! reply",

There is also a formula stepper that's mostly useless for debugging. I played with them and even tried to build a minikanren, but on my day to day job I just use them tactically, so I avoid their limitations and I'm quite happy with them for that. From memory: - Recursion is severely limited in lambda.\n  - There are extra pains when putting formulas on the name manager or on conditional formatting (although more focused on references than on lambdas in particular, usage of lambda would be more powerful if they didn't exist)\n  - You can't do arrays of arrays, so your data structures need to be flat reply",

But since you asked about: > basically augmenting your cognition with AGI-cloud Being able to (somehow) mentally query the web (or some knowledge source) and wait for the result (which I imagine might be like touching an object to see if it is hot) would be maddening. I can imagine subjects getting stuck in loops, or the mental equivalent of doom-scrolling. The reward seeking mechanisms in our brains would just lock-on this stuff like mainlining a drug. As for just having knowledge just appear in your mind, effortlessly - this could be even worse. There would be no boundaries. What happens to everyday activities? If you look at a sunset (say) or the face of someone you love, what does the implant's overlay do to the subjective experience? Of anything? It would be like never being alone or being eternally distracted, only exponentially worse. I can easily imagine subjects being driven to psychosis or suicide. And, of course, there will be advertising and porn, and malware and memetic replicators. Because there always are. reply",

          "text": "The iBrain is a confident next step in your computing experience, priced at the $699 bracket we know consumers love. The headlining feature is it's ability to record visual sensation and memories through a proprietary Spatial Aperature located at the front and rear of the device. It runs all of your favorite apps in a secure environment; if anyone ever attempts to compromise or steal the iBrain, it enters a lockdown mode until a trusted technician can restore your unit. It's just another part of why consumers love the iBrain ecosystem. Of course, recording your thoughts is only a fraction of the power we could be harnessing with iBrain. When you log in, your most-recent memories will get synchronized with the cloud, and are catalogued on-device in a trusted compute environment. This makes it simple to collect and share your thoughts, whether it's with your iPad or friends online. Your ideas go places, and we want to appreciate that with the architecture of iBrain. We just know that consumers will love the iBrain. Our focus groups can't get enough of it, and we can't wait to open for pre-orders this September. reply",

The way I wanted to do this is to create dashboards that would serve at the same time as infrastructure diagrams for documentation and live health monitoring. Right now, most documentation solutions aren't used on a daily basis so become out of date, because people don't think about it when making changes and fixes. And monitoring solutions only show you charts of things you're supposed to already know. They're very technically-oriented, and not business-logically oriented, if that makes sense. Like they'll tell you that process x is running on machine m, and that it's running out of ram, but nothing will tell you that process y that depends on x's outputs is going to fail as well. reply",

But I rarely publish anything beyond occasional LinkedIn posts.<p>My blockers:<p>•“Nobody needs this” / “It’s not original”<p>•“AI can explain most topics better than I can”<p>•A bit of fear: shipping something that feels naive or low-signal<p>At the same time, I read a lot of personal blogs + LinkedIn and I do get real value from them — mostly from perspective, lived experience, and clear thinking, not novelty.<p>For those of you who blog (or used to):<p>•What made it worth it for you?<p>•What kinds of posts actually worked (for learning, career, network, opportunities)?<p>•Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)?<p>•If you were starting today, what would you do differently?<p>I’m not trying to build a media business — more like building a “public notebook” that compounds over years.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Above all, it's accessible to everyone, not just those on a specific platform. I've had a blog for almost 20 years. Nowadays, it's the best record I have of what I'm interested in and working on. It has recipes I send to my friends, context for strangers. It's a beacon that attracts similar people, a call for them to reach out. And it works! I get emails about my posts. I helped people travel along the same routes, and fixed people's technical issues. Another blog of mine turned into a lifestyle business. I have met countless friends and two lovers through it. So yeah, do your thing, put it online. Start simple, migrate as needed. I love static sites because they're low maintenance. Hugo and a theme would be good. reply",

          "text": "AI can explain most topics better than I can This one is demonstrably false. Your personal written style is what's important. Also, you have hands-on experience, which is also demonstrably more than any \"AI\" has. I urge you to ignore this kind of doubt or consideration. - What kinds of posts actually worked (for learning, career, network, opportunities)? For learning, \"book report\" type posts, just to solidify what I've read in my mind, maybe drive a little experimentation to ensure I've concluded correctly. I've decided not to collect any metrics so that I don't follow from behind, so that I don't end up doing clickbait. Career and network opportunities have not arisen from my blog. My \"public notebook\" posts get more traffic, and I've referred back to them, but for me, these are mostly Linux sysadmin topics. I'd wager these are most valuable to people that find them for very specific problems, like seeing LLDP info from inside a WiFi access point or fixing GRUB problems on particular hardware. - Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)? I have not discovered anything for this, alas. I use Hugo, I have a couple of little shell scripts to do monthly counts of finished vs draft articles. I try to stay at or above 5 posts a month. I'm not sure that helps lower the bar, which I interpret as \"provide motivation to post\". What would I do differently? Start a blog years before I actually did so. I'm happy to correspond, my email is in my HN profile. reply",

          "text": "Hey, just wanted to let you know that your honeypot data for PHP-based attacks ended up factoring in charges being dropped in two criminal cases where prosecution attempted to run with a harebrained and ludicrous theory that basically centered around some... mythical idea of how these attacks happen and how specific they can be. The criminal justice system is where lurid fantasies of how tech works end up putting people in prison for sometimes years and budget concerns meant that attorneys filled parking meters every 4 hours and we had two full time investigators in an office of 40, most with a 80-120 caseload (rolling basis). Sometimes the data one puts online can really make an impact that my guess is that it was entirely unexpected and for two people in their 20s with young kids (separate cases, in fact, although not too far apart), it really reclaimed a good chunk of their lives. Thank you for that, and I hope others would do the same, because one never knows when it'll come in handy. So many products sold to LE are basically snake oil and without data and facts, the threat is incredibly coercive. Any leverage for defense helps balancing the playing field and frankly, nobody deserves to be taken to trial based on utter BS that has merit merely because it matches the equally unfounded anxieties of people, however unsubstantiated.Thanks again! reply",

You say you're not trying to build a media business, and want to build a \"public notebook\", but you imply you're looking for career/networking opportunities. You're also not clear if the \"learning\" is for you as the author, or for the reader. If you want to have your content discovered online, I'd say you might be in for some trouble, although I don't think AI is the cause, only an accelerator on that. Blogs for readers learning are probably in decline, you're unlikely to get any outreach based on your posts for networking. However if, like me, the writing process is the point – you're trying to clarify your thoughts, learn something new yourself, or have a document you can share with colleagues when they ask you to explain your opinions, I think blogging is valuable. While you won't get direct outreach, you can share it on your CV or send it to recruiters and you might get noticed when applying for jobs. reply",

If by \"worth it\" you mean a measurable ROI, then nothing.

None, probably less than 100 people have read it, I only share it in friend groups, but it feels nice when those friends read it and give me feedback. >Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)? What do you mean by \"lowers the bar\"? The length of my posts can be pretty variable, cadence is \"whenever\" and the blog can go months without an update, and themes are also pretty varied, sometimes I talk about some piece of fiction I like, other times it gets more technical, and sometimes too I just recount the process of making something and the insights it gave me. >If you were starting today, what would you do differently?

I don’t have links to either anywhere on the internet and they are both hosted on micro.blog. I am a customer facing  staff cloud consultant (specializing in app dev - “application modernization”) and when I have new personal insight, I randomly ramble to ChatGPT and ask it to give me a “devils advocate” response or a “steel man’s response”.  I go back and forth and give it my responses. I ask it to write a blog post about our discussion.  I have instructions like no em dashes, no “not $x. But $y”.  No call to action etc. I still edit the output heavily.  Once I am satisfied, I post it to my blog. My blog doesn’t have my name attached to it anywhere or any contact information. I do review it sometimes. What I feel is a really good post after a bunch of edits and giving it  time to marinate, gets copied to LinkedIn - with no link back to my blog. Even then I don’t care about “engagement”.  It’s so I will have a corpus of well thought out posts if I am looking for a job later. The other types of posts are just links, with a quote from the article and if I saw the article on HN, I link to the comments. I don’t need network opportunities through my posts.  I’ve been in the tech industry for 30 years this coming June and I’ve been in consulting 6.  I have plenty of industry contacts and a solid reputation. FWIW:  the other blog is just recording my frequent travels and concerts with my wife. reply",

Force yourself to exercise every day, because that's good for your physical health, but is blogging good for your health? Writing in public is performance art. Some people are naturally performance artists and need to perform to satisfy some internal urge. If you're not one of them, don't let anyone else convince you that you need to be one. It's ok to not blog. The idea that everyone should have a blog is completely unjustified. I read another comment that said you should write blog posts at least once a week.

I didn't want pressure to deliver crap (biweekly), nor did I want necessarily to put posts on too high of a pedestal (monthly+). > If you were starting today, what would you do differently? - Highly recommend going with simple tech. A static site based on Markdown does wonders. Offload discussion threads to sites like HN or reddit - the comment section of your links. reply",

Sometimes I get a nice comment on a years-old blog post and that's also rewarding. Additionally, sometimes I search for something and have my own years-old blog post come up, reminding me that I already solved that thing before and can reuse the solution. * All posts have worked to consolidate knowledge and help me think. * Since you're just trying to build a public notebook, what are you trying to lower the bar to? Your own writing motivation or something else? If the former, just write to the length/cadence/themes you're interested in and don't write what you're not interested in. * Maybe I'd go back and tell pretty-much-teenage-me to stop being so cringe because this stuff will still be there 20 years later. reply",

Writing forces you to make assumptions explicit, notice gaps, and resolve contradictions. That doesn’t get replaced by AI — if anything, AI makes undisciplined thinking easier to hide. The posts that tend to compound aren’t “explainers.” They’re records of decisions, trade-offs, failures, and mental models you’ve actually tested. That’s where perspective comes from, and that’s the part AI can’t synthesize for you. If starting today, I’d optimize for low friction and long half-life: short notes, irregular cadence, one theme you’re actively working on. Treat it as a public lab notebook.

          "text": "Writing is difficult and like all art forms, it’s subject to impostor syndrome. Blogging is the best way I have found to remind yourself that you’re not an impostor. And the more experience you get proving you’re not an impostor, the easier impostor syndrome is to deal with. Realistically if you start now, you’re years away from a devoted readership and that’s fine. You’ll gain from publishing and if you’re diligent, you’ll gain from watching your writing improve. For me, I like writing and can’t get paid enough in publishing or as a writer to do it professionally. So it’s worth it for me because I have a lot of fun writing. I spent a good part of my life hunting for eyeballs and now I’m content just writing whether anyone reads it or not. I’m not sure that I’d recommend any particular theme, cadence or style for a new blogger. And I definitely wouldn’t recommend a style of post. Rather those sorts of things will come organically as you get used to writing and start building a community. When you’re getting started, just focus on writing, trying to build habits and learning how to edit yourself. Most writers will struggle with one of the three on their way to developing a voice so if you’re going through hell you’re likely on the right path. If I were starting today, I’d focus less on hunting eyeballs and more on writing for the joy of it. I’d also spend a lot more time writing about subjects that I’m not interested in because that’s really good practice. And finally, I wouldn’t worry so much about writer’s block - it happens, it sucks but it goes away when you stop worrying about it. On the subject of writer’s block, if it’s something you struggle with I have a great exercise for you. When you’re stuck, interview yourself about the finished piece you’re stuck on. Pretend it’s done and interview yourself. I would have started doing that twenty five years ago and I’d be a far better writer now because of it. Finally, keep everything you write and read it regularly but there’s nothing wrong with pruning your blog regularly. If things you wrote two years ago are embarrassing today that means you’re a better writer. Go with that. reply",

I'm the wrong person to ask about discoverability because I've been blogging for 22 years and I've accumulated 100,000+ followers on Twitter, 39,000 on Bluesky etc. It's worth offering an email subscribe mechanism. I didn't do that for the first ~20 years - I offered just an RSS feed - but when I added the Substack newsletter option it become clear I should have been gathering email addresses from a lot earlier on! Despite having a substantial audience visiting my site now I still think the best way to get traffic to an article is to tell people about it elsewhere. I follow the POSSE principle: publish on own site, syndicate elsewhere: https://indieweb.org/POSSE Honestly though quality is much more important than quantity. Join communities of like-minded individuals and make sure that a small number of engaged people get to see your stuff. Opportunities from that are likely to be more valuable than if you have a much larger audience who aren't as closely aligned with what you're publishing. reply",

Re blockers: - Novelty: I routinely search for very niche, \"boring\" information, and am disappointed by how few in-depth blogposts I find. - “AI can explain most topics better than I can”. I doubt it!  I rarely find current AI as valuable as a good blog post. It tends to be shallow and regress to the mean, and b/c of hallucinations it's untrustworthy, so a lot of time is wasted fact-checking. - Fear of shipping: if it isn't relevant, nobody will read it (unless you're already famous) Re questions: - What made it worth it for you? Clarifying my thoughts, connecting with strangers who think about the same things, the leverage \"having a platform\" produces (it opens a lot of doors), and gaining prestige in certain niches. - What kinds of posts actually worked (for learning, career, network, opportunities)? I don't think this is simple to answer until the heat death of the universe. Traffic stats is a very poor estimator of value delivered. Which posts I am most proud of, and how much traffic they got, are weakly correlated. - Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)? Things that you are obsessed with. It's a tonne of work writing a good post, and sometimes you publish it and nobody cares, so it has to be intrinsically rewarding. - If you were starting today, what would you do differently? I don't know! Probably put less effort into trying to appear intelligent/impressive, which rarely works anyway. These are my off-the-top thoughts based on over a decade of blogging. reply",

I figure that if I do write, it will either be ripped off, outdone by a person, or suspected of having been ripped off from somewhere. There are also topics I would not feel comfortable blogging about because they are not PC. I think it is worth developing the skill of writing however. I haven't found a real way to solve these issues 100%, but it occurred to me that the odds of me having these problems would be lower if I paywalled my stuff or at least required registration for access. Free registration would not work if everyone did it the same way, but perhaps there is a way to have your own system that no crawler would bother trying to interface with. reply",

Here's one of mine, where in 2018 I look back on predictions made in 2012. Some held up well, some, it turned out, were physically impossible : https://benwheatley.github.io/blog/2018/07/17-16.09.05.html Naïve errors: Optical-wavelength metamaterial cloaking, fabric or otherwise, is not possible, the bandwidth is too narrow; Robot cars may be technically available in many countries, but they're sure not \"rapidly displacing human drivers because they are much safer and therefore cheaper to insure\". Close but no cigar: Nameplate solar power didn't reach par with global electricity use in 2024, but it did get to 1865 TW, which would have been 82% of global electricity use at the time I made the prediction. Actual global electricity use is 50% higher today than in 2012. Correct: China's GDP did in fact more than double between 2012 and 2022: https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=GDP+china+2022+%2F+GDP+... > •Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)? Something you find interesting. Look at my blog and you won't only find deep thoughts, you'll also find this because it was fun at the time: https://benwheatley.github.io/blog/2018/12/21-09.27.02.html But not just jokes, because I'll also write about bioprinted fairy drones: https://benwheatley.github.io/blog/2021/05/22-21.06.36.html reply",

          "text": "As someone who spent 2+ years building one, I would turn away now if you're looking for traction or sustainability ( https://couplingcafe.com ). Though I don't regret it and learned enough to speak to my in-laws. My retention numbers are decent, but I just haven't done the marketing bit yet, and am currently taking a break. Language learning apps are the ultimate sand-pit for solo developers thinking they can offer some random unique feature that Duolingo (or \"Anki but better\") doesn't offer. Without realizing, they don't do it for a reason. Language learning has extremely low activation and retention. And it's super easy to find one or two early adopters that like your app for some reason to keep going. And solo developers that get into language learning often are only strong in software development and lack in UX, design, product, or marketing. You may start with a calm, \"not Duolingo gamification\" style app, but every language learning app starts with pure intentions until you're many months or years in, your numbers are low, you need to make money, and you need to move the needle. My two cents, you don't have to heed it obviously. reply",

I’ve been interested in these kinds of tools for a long time, but I feel some sense of urgency in the LLM era, where I’ve already seen peers lose their edge by offloading the cognitive work. I’ve been interested in these kinds of tools for a while, that actually act as a bicycle for the mind. Most apps forgo the metacognitive and emotional labor that actually helps people learn effectively in favor of gamification because 1. Modeling these skills is hard 2. The first step to building effective learning habits is to restore the so-called “learn drive” which is the love of learning, play, and tinkering that underlies most effective learning and gamification does so but on an artificial level. There is so much content out there, and a sufficiently motivated person will find it and make meaning out of it. Most people are not motivated and don’t know how to motivate, meander, explore without gritting teeth, and I think you’ll probably just see churn without gamification unless you deal with that side of the process. Since I've tried to ship such tools before and ultimately failed, I’m explicitly not doing the whole SV fail fast and iterate thing here: I’m meandering, taking my time, letting motivation move me when it strikes versus going for the easiest or most obvious thing. (also sorry if this is itself meandering: I’m lifting while typing this on my phone) reply",

I strongly dislike duolingo - it's gamification kept me pre-occupied for a while without noticing that I wasn't making any progress learning the language. When I figured that out, I felt cheated by the app! A long time ago I used a beta app that was being built by a high school teacher that I really enjoyed. It basically had a bunch on YouTube videos with a few different type of exercises. Unfortunately I had a busy schedule and couldn't keep up and I don't think the app was successful. My day job is development in the education space. If you care about building a learning app, read up on learning theory / pedagogy. A concept I really like wrt language learning is \"comprehensible input\". Other things to consider with languages is that hearing native speakers is extremely important. ps. wrt to gamification - I wish that people took the parts of games that I do like when they gamify an experience - open worlds, exploration, story telling, low stakes, save points, fun! reply",

The best two apps right now IMHO are Reading.com and Mentava, and they take radically different approaches. Mentava is pretty gamified and kids can use it on its own, whereas Reading.com is basically a computer implementation of Siegfried Engelmann's instructional approach. Has to be used with a parent accompaniment, and most of the onscreen widgets are just there to facilitate co-teaching. Both apps are good and seem to be landing with their target markets, obviously the simpler one is aiming at a lower price point. Poor gamification is a bigger risk than non-gamification done well IMHO. That's where a lot of children's learning apps have failed in the past. reply",

There are maybe 50 such apps for each major language already in the App Stores. * As a customer I'd be happy to pay for serious, boring learning apps, and I believe such serious customers exist. (but in much smaller numbers) * Market for serious, boring language learning apps is underserved. (for German there are apps like Readle, Vocabeo, Vocabuo (yes, lol naming), DerDieDas  that cover specific niches, and (afaik) only DW has a quite comprehensive actual learning program) I believe potential customers like me exist, but our numbers are much less than \"learn Spanish in 5 minute games\" crowd and our expectations are higher too.

          "text": "I’ve been building a type of an educational app for the last 6 months. Spent 6 months building the product. Now I’m focusing on marketing and branding. I’ve spent last few weeks studying other successful educational products. And so far, from my research,  pretty much every single one of these apps/sites prioritized making the user “feel good” about learning rather than actually learning. And unfortunately, this is what the users want. They want to feel good about learning. All the successful education sites employ these mechanisms that you’re intending to avoid. I wanted to avoid using these as well - but I  just don’t see another way. I’ve even had users explicitly ask me to add milestones, streaks, etc to motivate them. Reality is - most people who really want to study or learn anything, can do so without an app. Even a book from a library will do. But it requires tremendous consistency, effort and time. Apps are way easier and make the user feel good - there’s still learning being done, don’t get me wrong. But user feeling good about it is what keeps them coming back. Edit: I’ve also studied many of their ads. Often times on places like TikTok, Instagram, etc their ads are what I would call “intelligence porn”. They get you excited about being more intelligent, investing in yourself, intelligence eliticism, etc. These were a common ad strategy that I have discovered so far. Some apps literally ran ads with text: “become dangerously intelligent” text and had the song from the show Succession play with images of famous researchers and scientists changing quickly. (Newton, Einstein, etc). Stuff like this cracked me up tbh lol. But apparently it works reply",

Every time the word \"gamification\" comes up in a conversation (with users, customers, internet posts), it reminds me of the quote from the great Charlie Munger \"Show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome\". Basically, gamification is supposed to incentivize the learner but a majority of training/learnings are unfortunately mostly about \"checking a box\" especially when it comes to required/regulated trainings (I mostly work with customers in these areas). So if you are building a learning app where learning is forced on the learner by someone else (their boss, employer, parent etc), then gamification won't be of any real use. No one will care if they just unlocked some imaginary points. On the other hand, my kids love learning in apps like Duolingo where they are proud of the \"streak\" they have for continuous number of days. But here is the thing. No one asked them to learn this stuff. They got interested (by watching a friend etc) and now they are playing the same game. reply",

This is cool, and I've auto-didacted a number of things with resources like this, and I know most here have as well. But, watching the interview with the Duolingo CEO linked in this thread, he's talking about reaching the far larger set of people that don't have strong intrinsic motivation to learn. Which is arguably a much more difficult and more important mission. The natural learners (and kids of white-collar parents) are already pretty well-equipped by the general state of the internet. This is where I'm finding some appreciation for some of the techniques that might be considered low-brow or deleterious by that cohort. reply",

When I say \"container\" I mean, the bundle of forces that your product exerts to bring the user in contact with the content. Some learning products are just content with zero container. Books are the limit example. Karpathy's \"Let's build GPT\" is another. Most learning products -- and all apps -- live or die by the container they create. (There is no reason to build a learning app other than to build a container. If you feel you have the best content, ship it on a content platform and save yourself a very painful distribution slog. Duolingo is in the container game. Their container is made of every cheap trick in the book -- notifications, streaks, etc -- because they work. My startup was Hack Reactor, the coding bootcamp, and we did it with pair programming and fixed classroom hours. (We had great content, but our competitors with good containers and bad content did leagues better than vice versa.) If you're building an app, you're in the container game. You can build a great container with no cheap tricks. I have done so! But you can't build a great learning app with no container, and you can't build a great container if you if you don't want to change your users' patterns of engagement and attention. So, what is your container? How will you weave a powerful spell that meaningfully transforms the attention and engagement of the app's user? What will cause them to pull up your app again and again, when they would have churned from a simple anki deck or whatnot? Given that you find it distasteful to use the easy levers you mentioned (notifications, \"streak\" psychology), what alternatives can shift your users' patterns of attention and engagement towards the learning task? If you have great answers to those questions, great! If you don't want to build a container, build content on a platform with easy distribution. If you want to build a container but you don't want to shape your users' attention or engagement, you are confused. reply",

You can start a conversation with someone, and talk to them about say, the Saracens, and then have them start wondering how they came about their (small) understanding of them. When they realise it was AOE cutscenes, and that the whole project was a backdoor to deliver historical knowledge to people. I feel like if you eschew gamification, your audience is largely only those with a deep interest of learning. I used an app to do a security cert a while back, and it would bug me 3 times a day, and challenge me to test my knowledge. I think it really helped keep my focus on the challenge. Likewise, when I was doing my CCNA years ago, the In-30-Days gentleman, would subscribe you to 30 days of motivational emails to read his book and practice the skills. Not an app, but the same sort of thing. Some people sell the motivation as the core product, some sell the game as the core product (to deliver motivation) and some people sell the knowledge as the core product. All are valid approaches just make sure you are happy with the market you are targeting. One more thing: I have absolutely no idea how to obtain calm in todays environment. I dont see myself engaging with an app that requires me to be calm ahead of time, but if it somehow strengthened or created a sense of calm that might be a sufficient product differentiator. reply",

          "text": "I don't think it's a mistake. Non-subscription without clear gamification and engagement tricks seems like Rosetta Stone basically and that's the longest-running, most effective language learning software I'm aware of. When I joined the Army 18 years ago, while waiting for school assignment, I had the opportunity to train provincial reconstruction teams as a role player and had to cram learn some reasonable level of conversational Pashtun and that was what we used, before smart phones were widely adopted. The only real innovation I've seen since then is conversational LLMs that allow you free-form practice without a human partner, but even back then, scripted conversational practice was pretty good as long as there was a wide enough diversity of scripts. Problem is more along the lines of \"solo developer\" here. Hacker News seems to have a real thing about this niche for whatever reason, but when doing something like this that I think requires real expertise in a wide variety of subjects that aren't software development, I think you need help. There's no way something like Rosetta Stone was developed without the input of experts in language learning and teaching, for instance. Knowing the platforms, programming languages, frameworks, and app store onboarding and delivery processes is already a lot for one person, but expecting to know the target domain on top of that is expecting an awful lot from yourself. I don't think it's a great sign trying to crowdsource business strategy from a free web discussion board, as a single example. This is the kind of conversation you want to have with your private team of people you know for sure have the experience they claim to have, not anonymous comments. reply",

There's certainly a market for \"calm\" learning, though you've already identified the main challenge: there's a smaller larger market for people who want to be educated than entertained, and the market for \"calm education\" is going to be an even smaller subset of that education market. Essentially you're looking for the people who are saying \"I want to be educated, but I'm not looking for the most efficient way to do it. I would prefer to move at a slower pace being driven purely by intrinsic motivation, rather than using extrinsic motivators in order to encourage me to move more quickly\" That market certainly exists, but it's a small enough niche that you'll likely have to be compete at a high price point to be viable. As point of comparison, Mentava costs $500/month, so if I were building a calm learning app (for an even smaller market), I would try to figure out a way justify an even higher price point than Mentava's. reply",

I won't say what you are building is a mistake. But just based on what you described, if I were interested in learning a language through your app, I would not just be comparing it to other language learning apps, but I would also be comparing it to language textbooks/workbooks, classes at a community college or MOOC, or language courses on DVD/CD/YouTube/etc. I guess I think that apps are good at gamifying things, if that were to be a goal. If you are stripping that away, what makes your app unique compared to all those other resources? How does your app replace or supplement other things? And to be clear, I imagine there could be plenty of things that make your app unique! I just would want to know what those things are before diving in. reply",

It was no bullshit, no gamification, and no distraction. I used it for one or two months, 700 hours in total. I can attribute to it some progress in learning my target language. Then I went on vacation for a few weeks and completely forgot about it. Today I tried to find it again, but since I forgot its name, I couldn't find it easily. Normally, I would search my inbox, but there was not a single mail from it. When I found it, I learned it improved quite a bit and added a way to support the app through subscriptions. Now, if it had some promotions or gamification built-in, I would be reminded of its existence and would most probably have been using it at least 700 more hours until today, and maybe even subscribed to it. And it would bring me closer to reaching the learning goal in my target language. TL;DR: Yes, some gamification or nagging is necessary. But don't overdo it. [1] https://morpheem.org/ reply",

However, due to the more user-driven approach to this learning method (output-focused, user has to put in effort to chat with the AI and get feedback), there is more friction with using the tool. This isn't necessarily a bad thing - in fact, more friction can lead to more meaningful experiences.

          "text": "To me, a learning needs some kind of gamification and engagement tricks. There is nothing calm about learning, you need the dopamine! Among other things, dopamine is the learning hormone, it is a problem when it makes you learn the wrong things, like \"fentanyl is really great\", or \"I need to buy more stuff I don't need\", but it is also what helps you learn useful skills and life lessons. I remember my father, a teacher, who told me he viewed his job in the classroom as a performance art. His knowledge was secondary, if that's knowledge you want, just read a book, go to the internet, whatever, you don't need a teacher. But it is not very engaging, and a teacher's job is to make it more engaging. So without engagement, you probably won't make a good learning app, but you can make the engagement entirely targeted towards learning and not monetization, which would be a very good thing. reply",

          "text": "I think yes. If you don't create an obvious avenue for the user to infer his development, he won't be able to do it. \nYou have to confuse the audience to bring in the sense of progress. \nPeople learn by being challenged, confused, and by building something. Nobody learns by interfacing with an application that promises it. \nBut besides learning nothing, they can feel good about being engaged, by completing tasks, seeing progress bar moving, seeing number go up. \nSomeone that decides to interface with a learning app instead of learning the damn thing is doomed, will never learn anything at all. Just give them a sense of accomplishment so they can feel good about it. Without gamification what would the platform give them? \nIf don't help them cope with their inertia, there really is nothing you could do. \nMaybe you are equating gamification with dark patterns?\nGamification is not necessarily a bad thing. It is a powerful psychological trick. Can definitely be used for good. \nWorking on performance often feels amazing because we can profile, identify clear bottlenecks and work to reduce them. When you manage to make number go down, you have a clear indication something went right. Maybe you didn't absolutely improve de code, but you made it better in a very specific way under a very specific lens. People like it because of this aspect, and it does feel a little bit like a game. There is a clear requirement and a clear specification. The game aspect makes it very enjoyable. \nI suppose development against a test suite provides a similar experience. Feels good in a game-ish way. \nGamification is more related to the feels good than dark patterns, but obviously, the whole industry will ONLY be interested in exploiting practices. There is no incentive to make the user feel good, at all, without being pervasive. \nIf you care about your user, you should design around the user. Inevitably, you will think a bunch about what feels good. \nIf all you care about is the user learning, developing competence, you will offer no platform at all. The platform will tell them to close it and go do the thing.\nIf you want to motivate them, another story. If you want them to feel accomplished, another story. You're building a feels good, want to feel accomplished want to fool myself into learning app.s gamification is the whole point. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I've been on a business trip this week, and sitting on the plane, I was randomly browsing NYT and read this article which really REALLY pissed me off: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/14/us/fire-department-software-private-equity.html?unlocked_article_code=1.8k8.yzeR.NwSK3PTQeXQj&amp;smid=nytcore-android-share<p>TLDR: Private equity is buying up all these software vendors, and preying upon vulnerable fire departments; one rural department with a total budget of $130k/yr saw their software costs go up 3x in one year (from $4k/yr to $12k/yr).<p>I want to do something. I have not worked in the emergency services domain before, so I know that I am naive. I do have experience with oncall and mission-critical software maintenance and highly available/durable services, but when I say mission critical I mean millions-of-dollars at risk, not human lives.<p>I want to solicit HN for very early directional advice, of any and all kinds.<p>- Are there some existing open source projects or foundations with a mission like this, to serve and protect critical services like emergency response?<p>- Is it feasible to build incrementally, i.e. ship small components of incremental value, and would fire departments be open to trying an open source option?<p>- Are there things like certifications or regulatory hurdles, that might be expensive to get?<p>- Does anyone randomly happen to have experience in this industry, and would be willing to write up their perspective?<p>My early initial thesis is something like this: I personally cannot stomach the idea of simply passively \"letting\" private equity invade this aspect of society, to hold emergency services departments and by extension taxpayers hostage. They are essentially extorting and exploiting society's inelastic demand for emergency fucking services. So I don't care about making profit, I only care about actually solving the needs of the emergency departments and of protecting human life (knowing that I am naive still, I definitely do not want to overpromise and put lives at risk). But my personal feelings aside, I do think there is a useful insight here: if useful software can be made reliably and cheaply, by engineers motivated to help their communities  instead of profit (or just to poke private equity in the eye), then ultimately private equity cannot compete against an adversary that doesn't care about profit -- we actually CAN WIN, because eventually they will give up and exit these industries if they see that there is no profit to squeeze.<p>I am looking for like-minded builders. I seriously think the software foundation could simply be a vehicle for early-retirement rich FIREd ex-techies, to add some new purpose in their lives, by using their skills to solve a targeted and well-scoped set of problems.<p>\"Some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned, or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world [NOT] burn [because the fire departments should have cheap reliable emergency services software].\" -- Alfred Pennyworth, The Dark Knight<p>\"Beware the fury of a patient man.\" -- John Dryden<p>I am a patient man, with a newly gained cold fury. I am willing to write code. Or organize a software foundation. Or be an investor/funder for someone else to write the software. Or whatever form of help I can give.<p>Appreciate any and all help or feedback (positive or negative)!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Attention spans will drop even lower, causing severe psychological problems. Think 'Digital Dementia 2.0.' Later, LLMs will be portrayed as something evil, yet everyone will still use them. Parents will use them, while telling their kinds not to do so. Leetcode is already standard for SWE interviews, but other industries will need to adopt similar tests to verify that an applicant's brain is functioning correctly and that they're capable of doing the job. Maybe a formal confirmation from a psychologist specializing in 'fried brains' will be required. reply",

My Brain was already fried from social media and now there is always an \"easy\" way to do annoying but very educational tasks. And amongst my peers, especially those without a background in IT, misunderstanding and anthropomorphising has made this even worse. I think for people who already have great skills, AI will probably be helpful, not harmful. But for my generation, which has been through covid, social media and now has to figure out healthy AI usage, this is a fight already lost. reply",

AI just enables you to work on bigger problems because you’re not spending so much time “calculating by hand”.

LLMs start feeling like databases or cloud compute. No SpaceX or OpenAI IPO moment. Capital markets quietly reward the boring winners instead. S&P 500 grinds out another double digit year, mostly because earnings keep up and alternatives still look worse. Tech discourse stays apocalyptic, but balance sheets don't. If you mute politics and social media noise, 2026 probably looks like one of those years that we later remember as \"stable\" in retrospect. Bonus: Bitcoin sees both 50k and 150k. reply",

          "text": "I wrote a lot. Let me add a tldr: any international trades happening in non-US dollar is an \"acceleration\" of dedollarizatiom, given that currently all trade is dollarized. Original: I don't known if I understand the spirit of the question. There are no metrics or tracking of how \"dollarized\" the international economy is because virtually all trade is done in dollars and there has been no risk of this changing for the past ?65? years My original prediction for 2026 ( not 2025, mind you) made in 2024 was based on a few factors, if I recall correctly, 1) the Russia-Ucraine war and related sanctions; 2) the open discussion in BRICS about trade in direct currencies; and 3) the then-promised isolatonist policies of Trump's second mandate. What we've seen in 2025 makes all of those stronger I guess. 1) I don't know the status of the Russia-Ucraine war; all I know is it is a glaring sign of the end of Pax Americana (as is the Israel-Palestine genocide/war, by the way, which the US would -not- have allowed given the strong internal opposition and negative popularity among the American public). So sanctions of Russia notwistanding, that status quo, which strongly related to dollar as reserve currency, is either agonizing or dead. 2) Trump and the US attempted a very strong response to the (first ever?) trades in local currency between Brazil and China, mostly in the form of targeted tariffs (all discourse about Bolsonaro and whatever being the motivation for tariffing Brazilian imports being, in my opinion, political smoke and mirrors). I don't think it worked. I think BRICS might press on this. If the mercosur/EU trade deal goes through it will also be a strong force towards trade in Euros/Reais/Pesos directly I believe. 3) I don't think I need to clarify; tariffs and other issues brought on by the current US government were severely negative to the placement of the US as a preferred trade partner. This is to beyond economic choice; active anti-american sentiment are at all times high in countries like Canada, Denmark, and Mexico, all historically aligned with the US. This may not seem that relevant but come election cycles in those and other countries we might see platforms/candidates that openly propose to \"secede\" from the US hegemony international order. If that happens, removing US military bases is a first go. Alternatives to the US \"petrodollar\" a close second. reply",

I really feel \"web dev\" is going to get highly commoditized by GenAI, by web dev I mean 99% of building CRUD-adjacent apps, we are already seeing it now with tools like Claude Code etc, this pipeline is just going to get more refined, with tigther testing feedback loops, PR-workflows and a CI/CD deployment pipeline which the GenAI will control. This might be amplified by the fact the sheer amount of tested, high quality there is in the JavaScript-ecosystem for the AI to train on and learn from. Software engineering in general will tend more systems and embedded software, fields where GenAI can't perform well or can't be trusted to produce good code (I am thinking writing device drivers, or maintainence of legacy C applications) as well as deep research fields. The average software engineering job might be either that of a \"technical product manager\", or \"researcher\" or \"low-level systems expert\" That's just what I feel. Honestly, I am probably much younger an others on this forum, so I haven't really seen this industry \"evolve\" this is just how it looks to me now. I believe there was a time in the early 2010s where there was a boom of this \"generalist developer\" where if you knew your JavaScript-ecosystem (or App Dev ecosystem for that matter) pretty well, you could land a pretty decent job right out of college, or without a college degree at all. To me, at this stage the world in general needs software engineers who understand the \"world\" if that makes sense (in terms of physics, mathematics), or who have a really good mental model of computation. Better put, software engineering will become a tool in the larger context of research & development of tech that advance humanity. reply",

I mean, we have SRE, which is a whole set of skillsets in itself and it does involve around maintaining \"CRUD-apps\"; Heck there is the cybersec industry as well, ensuring CRUD-apps aren't exploited. My para was certainly a bit more 2D, I was speaking more from what I might benefit learning now, to get a job, say end of 2026. I have observed many roles like SRE etc, require certain experience which is hard to get by working on your own projects without much traction; similiar case for cybersec but to a lesser extent. It's this paradox where in order to become a senior engineer, you must get hired as a junior engineer, to learn and observe how production software works, but that is pretty hard these days. reply",

Yes that's true but I would argue this isn't because of AI itself. Sure it might have accelerated it but I have heard that in the 2020's a lot of people got a lot of jobs in the industry and then its that the market did feel saturated and in a sense, a lot of jobs feel this way in the economy where if someone has it, they continue having it but its becoming harder for new people to enter, there are financials reasons for this too mostly if i remember, interests rates are one of the core reasons That being said, Even though I have used LLM's a lot, I do not agree with your opinion and I am even younger than you most likely (17) A lot of people my age/people just going into college would use AI a lot to cheat but I will genuinely try to take it slow to learn things. I will try to use it as a learning tool and not as a crutch. Currently I am still in high school and I get ideas which I wish to implement but dont have the time because of exams so I test them out with LLM's but even I find the whole process frustrating at times and its just, maybe its me but there is a good ceiling that I can process. Some basic crud processes can definitely be in that but if your project is novel, even basic things can be hard I will give you an example, I recently tried creating an api for proton docs which worked by having browser instances. I had two basic scripts that worked on one platform and converted them to puppeteer using LLM and after it worked, I then asked it to simply create a very basic crud api on top of it Nope, I tried it 5-6 times on the best models on the market but they couldn't actively take two files which had read/write and have it work, either there was an issue in read or an issue in write I am fine with the project as it is right now and I am fine with the templates it has given me and I am going to build it now on top of it I had many ideas which could be considered basic crud apps like having a kanban app/github issues like ui on top of bitwarden after I saw a post here by simon saying how he uses github issues and that went semi-viral on hackernews Another issue is that I think just as how sure writers and similar can generate AI generated, I feel like there would be more trust on the non AI generated code. Personally I will try my best to create prototypes with AI and if I like them, I will see what it does and then rewrite them myself as an learning experience and also because people say spec driven development etc. but I just want to code things by hand at this point or convert the LLM generated prototypes of idea to something that I later code and understand by hand tbh (most likely when I get into college) reply",

The opportunities to have a successful career as a salaried employee decline significantly - people are pushed to start small businesses out of necessity - and this barrier is lower due to AI.

I’m just going to bullet some of them out in no particular order: - We do the work to find the restaurant and curate a menu, story, and theme. E.g., we might go to an Indian restaurant and focus the event on only the southern regional dishes. - Many times we have dishes that are off menu specially for our event. - Sense of community. We have quite a few regulars who have gotten to know each other. In 2025, 45 people reached their 20th or 30th event with us. Since we take over the whole restaurant there’s a little more freedom in how the space is used. Lots of new friendships have been forged. - When you go to a restaurant with a friend or small group, you can only order so much. We’ve had events with upwards of 25 different bites. There’s really no better way to sample everything the restaurant has to offer. - There’s a few people who say their partner are picky eaters, so they come to our event each month to have the opportunity to be a bit more adventurous. It’s an incredibly diverse group with a lot of different reasons to attend. reply",

          "text": "My partner and I divide and conquer. He focuses on front of house and I handle the backoffice. The process starts ~3 months before the event. We start by picking a theme or region. Then contact some restaurants that fit the criteria and pitch them the event. That kicks off the back and forth on cost and menu. Around 4 weeks before the event we send a save the date + previous event recap email. We summarize the last event and tease the next event, without giving away the actual resturant or type of food. Over the next week we prep the invite email and payment forms. This requires putting the dishes on our menu template, research and writing about the history of the dishes, the region, and the resturant. Some of this content also goes onto our website. Three weeks out we send the invite, which is a lottery system. Members have 5 days to request a seat and place a credit card hold. 5 days later we run the lottery (I wrote some basic software to randomize assignment, conver the card auth to capture and release any cards that didn't get assigned a ticket). Then we send an email to everyone who got in with which night they recieved and another email to anyone who was waitlisted. Everyone is added to a spreadsheet to track. 1 week before the event we send a reminder email and a last chance to cancel before the ticket is non refundable. At the event we play host and check each guest in and say hi to everyone. Then we give a prepared ~5 min intro about the food, restaurant, celebrate any milestone members, and make any general house keeping accounments. Our 20 club members get a branded apron. At the event we take video and pictures. Over the course of the next 4 weeks we post dish pictures with descriptions and history of the dish on our instagram. We also make a 1-2 min recap video of the event which also goes on our instagram and website. Separate from the actual event related work we have to manage the books, handle members emails, and review membership requests. More recently we started selling shirts, so there's a little work in managing that as well. reply",

We also have an unbelievably respectful and mature community. After over 70 seatings we’ve never had an incident. We also have a code of conduct document we send all new members. Second, we setup an LLC to shield us personally from legal liability. Third, not to say that it shields us, but the restaurants also have insurance and are a better target for a lawsuit. We are in the US, and at the end of the day anyone can sue anyone for anything. It’s just the reality and risk of the times. It hasn’t been a problem for us yet. reply",

The compute would differ, but loading speed shouldn't be an issue if you can render the HTML first, and hydrate it after page load. This static HTML would then also serve as fallback when Javascript is disabled. - For a quick demo, I doubt you will lose people by embedding an older version. Serving a version of a few months ago seems like 80% of the work, with 20% of the effort, in terms of deployment. Anyhow, nice to see government funds put to a good cause! reply",

          "text": "There's a really awesome site called Librivox [1], where volunteers narrate books that are in the public domain. Those recordings are also in the public domain as well (this is just part of the Librivox thing). The quality of those recordings (both the narration, and the actual recording quality) varies quite a bit and most of them aren't at a quality I'd expect people to pay for and thus aren't useable for me. I've spent hours and hours sorting through those recordings finding the best ones (from a narration perspective) and then improving the recording/audio quality on them. Those recordings have all mostly been made in the last 20yrs, so they're not old recordings of the books. So, the value I add to the Librivox recordings are: curation/selection, audio enhancement, and a much better delivery mechanism (IMHO). I'm also simultaneously building out our own library of original audio content by working with voice actors to get them recorded and proof read (this is a very expensive and time consuming process, but also very fun). One of the hardest parts is honestly the proofing process. Once I get finished narration files I have to compare them result with the actual script (as there are always mistakes) and request edits. I use whisper.cpp to transcribe them and then git and a few other scripts to compare the transcript with the actual book text. I'll also add that I _do not_ use AI Audio narration because it just doesn't sound good IMHO, and I personally hate listening to it. I regularly run experiments to see what the current state of the tech is and it's still pretty far from where it needs to be IMO. I also don't love the idea of AI swallowing absolutely everything. I appreciate the feedback and compliment! [1] https://librivox.org/ reply",

          "text": "https://mytinycafe.com/ An PWA primarily for my wife and my daughter. They can order their hot chocolate and their coffee as if they were going to grab something at a fancy café downtown, but instead it's at home and I'm the barista. It is quite nice to have for when my wife comes back from work and want something specific, or when we are waiting for the visit of a few friend, they can order exactly the available beverages and everything is ready when they're here. It was also a good playground for me to implement Web Push notifications (to never miss new orders). It's a basic Nuxt 3 app with Appwrite as the backend with rough edges, but much enough for our household use ! If you want to spam my phone with notifications, please visit my café : https://mytinycafe.com/alix reply",

          "text": "I'm working on porting KiCad to the browser. It's a lot of sweat and tears, multithreading issues and some more sweat. I've updated a port of WxWidgets and now I support all the features KiCad needs with ~200 tests. Right now I have a build that loads in the browser, but I really want to have \"multithreading\" which means workers in the web. One can use asyncify with emscripten to translate blocking C++ to WASM, but that transition is not perfect, right now I'm debugging a bug where there's a race condition that halts all execution and the main thread runs in an infinite loop waiting for the workers to stand up. I guess I'll have a few of those ahead. The main goal is to 1. just have fun 2. use yjs as a collab backend so multiple people can edit the same PCB. This will probably work with pcbnew, KiCad's layout editor, since it has a plugin system and AFAIK I can do the sync layer there. For the rest ( schematic, component editor etc. ) I'll have to figure out something..\nKiCad does not sync automatically if you modify a file, I'll have to do some lifting there. Anyway, it's a lot of fun, I really want this thing to exist, I'm hoping that I won't run into a \"wellll, this is just not going to work\" kind of issue in the end. reply",

          "text": "On the subject of whisper being great... A few weeks ago a co-worker commented about the difficulty he'd had editing a work demo, I pointed at various jump-cutting tools that had automated what he did in the past (editing out silences). But I'd also wanted to play with whisper for a while... So a couple of hours later I'd written a script that does transcription based editing: on the first pass it grabs a timestamped transcript and a plain text transcript for editing; you edit the words into any order you like and a second pass reassembles the video (it's just a couple of hundred lines of python wrapping whisper and ffmpeg). It also speeds up 4x any silences detected that sit within retained sequences in the video. Matching up transcripts turns out to be not that hard; I normalise the text, split it, and then compare to the sequence of normalised words from the timestamped transcript. I find the longest common sequence, keep that, then recurse on the before/after sections (there's a little more detail, but not much). I also sent the transcription to ffmpeg to burn in as captions, because sometimes it makes the audio choppy and the captions make it easier to follow. I know, tools have been doing this for years now. I just didn't have one to hand, and now I do, and I couldn't have done this without whisper. reply",

          "text": "Multimedia VoIP for hard of hearing / deaf-blind :) Working on a platform matching deaf video / text callers to interpreters, who then dial out to PSTN (phone network). Granted there is some web-stuff involved (one of the clients involved is Web-RTC), but it is mainly VoIP protocols among non-web or even 3rd party clients. Working with a stateful and complex protocol like SIP is fun and a pain. You need stateful load balancers, traffic routing can be tricky (f.ex. in k8s...), interoperability between providers is not trivial, etc. We also use relatively niche protocols for real-time text over RTP, which isn't (or until recently, hasn't been) supported in much VoIP software. This is starting to change due to EU legislation requiring accessibility in all commercial PSTN services, however. The market for this type of tech was very small ~15-20 years ago. Thus, the company was comitting to every possible sales lead, leaving a right mess in tech debt. So much of the work is handling and working around that... Much of the product pre-dates viable, affordable 3rd party technology, so there are home-grown components for all sorts of things: conferencing media component that also supports text, RTP proxies that were needed because few 3rd party clients supported ICE or TURN, etc. Stateful and complex protocols, with home-grown bespoke software components, 3rd party interoperability, 15-20 years  of technical debt, and changing customer demands.

The work is interesting and different challenges arise when having to process and compute datasets that are updated with 10s of TBs of fresh data daily. reply",

It got the experience I needed and after the first year and changing jobs, my pay substantially increased. I realize not everyone can take the approach I took. It may not even work these days.

GUIs are a whole different beast in C/C++ (and are a big reason why frameworks like Electron were built). LLMs can also help you break into C development by a large degree.

Bonus of using an open source kernel is they have a lot of eyeballs on them. They will be pretty dialed in versus studying random Github projects that happen to be written in C.

At the end of the day we don’t usually write our own peripheral drivers anymore, so it’s important to have good BSP support for your language. So whatever you use, you usually have to wrap the C.

The embedded system continually measures the voltage at each electrode, and can electrically stimulate the neurons via the same. Users are provided with an easy to use Python API that allows realtime observation of the raw signals and of detected action potentials (spikes). They can also execute precisely controlled stimulation sequences, which allows information to be presented to the neurons. Then there are a lot of higher level application APIs to handle things like recording data, real-time visualisation, and experiment config management. Why: it appears to be possible to teach neurons to perform tasks (we taught some to play pong several years ago). Since then our focus has been on building a system that enables rapid iteration in this sort of research.

We published a new release today and team members from the US were able to see it as published while members from different countries still saw the release marked as a draft and not visible publicly. We only noticed it two hours after making our announcements. We had to unpublish and publish it again to fix it.<p>- Recently, a colleague noticed a number of unrelated changes while reviewing a diff on GitHub, which led to us reverting a merge, only to later notice that the commit itself had no issues and it was the GitHub UI.<p>Outages and major issues are fine, they are loud and addressed directly. These kinds of issues go unnoticed, and they reduce trust silently.<p>I no longer trust the GitHub interface and actions. We had to re-test our release assets manually to make sure GH didn't mess that up.<p>Could this be yet another result of trusting AI code too much without proper review and testing? While discussing internally, one of my colleagues mentioned that \"the whole internet feels fragile lately\".<p>I'm curious to hear if anyone else has been facing such weird issues with GitHub.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

I’ve never met anyone who can clearly explain how it works in practice. Not just the rules, but the dynamics: what’s repeatable, what’s luck, and what actually matters.<p>By using the Kevin Bacon-number idea: I can usually get within three degrees of separation of well-known technologists like Linus Torvalds, but I can’t seem to get within three steps of someone who confidently understands how HN works.<p>So I’m asking sincerely:\nDoes anyone here feel they understand Hacker News?\nIf so, what are the real levers, and what do people consistently misunderstand?<p>PS: This question comes from a mix of genuine curiosity and personal frustration. I’m honestly trying to understand how HN works in practice.</p></p></p></p></div>",

I've made friends here, have been helped by people on projects that I was busy with, did the reverse, found friends and business partners and spend way too much time. HN is a very interesting slice of the online world, a place that is unlike the rest, sometimes a bit dry but always interesting and extremely useful. If you're looking at it to try to understand it then you might as well try to understand a rat or a mouse. You won't understand it because it isn't there to be understood, it just is, like any other organism. The root of HN is a thing called 'startup news', that was changed very quickly and since then HN has been a focal point for techies of all sorts but also lots of other people from all walks of life and from a large variety of countries. It isn't 'one thing' to everybody that participates, just like a hammer is a different thing for a carpenter than it is for a masoner or a farmer. The fact that after being a member for a couple of years you have this question indicates a lack of participation, not a lack of understanding. reply",

          "text": "> Hacker news is there to promote ycombinator companies I should probably clarify this a bit. It's true that HN sponsors Launch HNs (and Show HNs) by YC startups. This is in the FAQ: https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html . However, YC would not be funding HN if that were the only reason for it. It's a secondary factor. Far more important than promoting existing startups is attracting founders who might start new startups. This requires an entirely different strategy than promotion: it requires being interesting enough to attract the right kind of users. That's why the site is organized around curiosity, as I explained elsewhere in the current thread ( https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46309399 ). For more on this, here are past explanations: optimizing for curiosity - https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&sor... relationship between HN and YC's business interests - https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=false&so... reply",

That's because giving “extra help” to YC-funded startups is far less valuable (to everyone including the startup themselves [1]) than just making HN interesting to readers and showcasing cool projects, no matter who has built them. [1] More than almost anything else, what I've learned from moderating HN is that “extra help” to get onto the front page of HN is of barely any help at all. That is, if the post isn't interesting enough to earn significant numbers of upvotes and good comments very quickly, it will disappear off the front page very quickly.

I've also seen people associated with YC backed companies here downvoted into the toilet for spouting unpopular opinions.

I've always been a fan of analyzing all of the flags retro-actively to see if they were just or not and to have a per-subject matrix that would weigh flags from particular users.

I assume anything corporate or corporate aligned, which I believe this forum is, is being manipulated by the owners because they are structurally unreliable. Corporations are counter parties who will betray you the second it’s in their benefit, and then crow about it in their quarterly earnings reports to their shareholders. They’ll have their pocket MBAs and lawyers tell you how they have a fiduciary duty to maximize shareholder returns and quote some fucking 1920s era lawsuit with Henry Ford despite not actually having to maximize return but just having to do what’s in the shareholders best interests. The sociopaths in our society have determined that means getting more money even if other people are harmed. I am going to continue assuming that any corporate aligned org is following the incentives of our societal structure until we change that, and if you try to convince me I should ignore the structural incentives then I am going to assume you are trying to pull the wool over my eyes. reply",

I think you're right that the cost of Hacker News is that my participation is lending some (tiny incremental) legitimacy to Y Combinator. It's also costing some tiny amount of my attention, in the sense that I may not have heard of Y Combinator if it weren't for Hacker News. For me personally, that is absolutely fine – but I'm glad you made it explicit so that it's a conscious choice.

That was an unexpected bonus. “To promote ycombinator” only works if there’s an audience worth promoting to. Building something great that brings people back day after day maybe has the result that it can also serve as a promotional tool - but that’s a bonus, not necessarily a purpose. I’m not the person you asked the question of - but I think the purpose of ycombinator is to give relevant people a place to discuss things aligned with the ecosystem in which ycombinator operates, to help strengthen and champion that ecosystem. Does it have a payoff for ycombinator? Almost certainly. Was it created with that explicit purpose in mind? I doubt it. There are easier ways to make money. reply",

Initially it was supposed to be a side project—an application to sharpen Arc on, and a place for current and future Y Combinator founders to exchange news._ _ Hacker News is an experiment, and an experiment in a very young field. Sites of this type are only a few years old. Internet conversation generally is only a few decades old. So we've probably only discovered a fraction of what we eventually will._ _ Hacker News is definitely useful. I've learned a lot from things I've read on HN. I've written several essays that began as comments there. So I wouldn't want the site to go away. But I would like to be sure it's not a net drag on productivity.

The reason why HN is so much better than other fora (IMO) is that the mods don't allow lever-pulling and astroturfing to overtake regular contributions. Yet it's also popular, so you're bound to get some activity on most posts. Sure, it can be frustrating if you're trying to promote a product or farm karma on posts. But the fact that mostly nobody cares about karma means that you can post something and have it be evaluated on its technical, economic, social merits. Obviously, there are caveats to this - i.e., anything US- and FAANG-related is bound to get much more activity than otherwise - but the overall atmosphere of HN is refreshing compared to Reddit. reply",

          "text": "I can't know for sure. For me, it's just the \"eyeball method\" of comparing HN and different subreddits on Reddit. As to how I (or anyone) could show this, here are a few example questions: 1. How many examples of stealthy but otherwise blatant promotion do you see in the comments? Not every astroturfing campaign will be successful or original, so you'd be able to notice some patterns. Plus, HN is already commercially oriented, and there's the \"Show HN\" option, so it reduces the incentives for astroturfing. 2. Alternatively, how much controversy is there around the specific type of forum? For some subreddits, for example, you'd be able to see counter-subreddits popping up when participants feel the mods are abusing their power to promote one type of opinion. 3. Is a certain type of political/brand-related opinion or interpretation always at the top of your comment feed? For example, if upvotes determine the order of the comments, do you consistently see fewer critical comments on things that you'd expect the community to react to in different ways. 4. Do you consistently see some contributors having more power in discussions over others? Other than the mods, obviously. If this is the case, karma (i.e., number of upvotes) often has more value. Still, I could be wrong. reply",

          "text": "(I'm a mod here) It's true that this place can be cryptic, and that has downsides—specifically, it can be confusing to newcomers, even to some newcomers who would make ideal HN users. That sucks. But there's a key that unlocks most of the puzzles. That is to understand that we're optimizing for exactly one thing: curiosity. (Specifically, intellectual curiosity, since there are other kinds of curiosity too.) Here are links to past explanations about that: https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&sor... We try to elevate things that gratify curiosity: creative work, surprising discoveries, deep dives, technical achievements, unusual personal experience, whimsical unpredictability, good conversation, etc. And we try to demote things that run against curiosity, especially repetition, indignation, sensationalism, and promotion. It gets complicated because you'll also see plenty of repetition, indignation, sensationalism, and promotion on HN—alas! This is the internet after all. But the site survives because the balance of these things stays within tolerable ranges, thanks to two factors: an active community which cares greatly about preserving this place for intended purpose ( https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html ); and an owner (Y Combinator) that pays us to work on the site full time and mainly just wants us to keep it good, to the extent possible. If you really want to figure this place out, the way to do it is as a reader . Hang out on the site, look at the mix of articles that make the frontpage, spend time in the discussion threads (hopefully the interesting sectors and not the flamey ones!), and over time your eyes will adjust. What doesn't work—and this is good because we want it not to work—is approaching HN as a platform for promoting content. If you (<-- I don't mean you personally, but anyone) mainly care about \"how can I use this thing to get attention for my startup/blog/project/newsletter\", then you're operating in 'push' mode rather than 'pull' mode (or 'idle' mode, which is even better). In that case you won't be curious because you're too focused on what you're wanting for extraneous reasons—and if you aren't in a state of curiosity, this place won't make sense. At least we hope it won't! reply",

Honestly hackernews to me is a place where tinkering as a hobby is appreciated. I have read so many large threads here and ended up sometimes having a new point of view on something and so many posts here which make me want to be curious and tinker around too. I cannot really name something exactly which clicks on hackernews but that is what makes it unique and this does mean I cannot explain it to others sometimes since my hobbies are tangential to hackernews too, I just end up saying my hobby is tinkering with computers (currently only software) reply",

It's all the same arguments over and over, most of them without a shred of evidence. It feels like people aren't arguing in good faith any more, we're all just screaming our politics at (or past) each other. This didn't use to be the case.

There’s a handful of ideas we’re collectively mulling over at any given time. They slowly rotate in and out, and modulate into different keys as they go. For instance, the leading edge of LLM related discourse seems to be improving now that we’re getting bored with both hype and outrage, although there’s still plenty of hype and outrage. Old topics still occasionally blip into focus, but they don’t have the same staying power. Like, you’ll see a Rails post every now and then, but it’s not the darling it was. I doubt we’ll ever see the likes of “Rails is a Ghetto” make the rounds again, because nobody’s worked up about it any more. Or take Skrillex, who must have been on the front page every week for a month. I was annoyed at the time, but I think we’re due for a retrospective on programmers and dubstep. I’m not the one to write it though; not my scene in the first place. Anyway, thank you dang for your moderation! reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Here’s how we’re working with LLMs at my startup.<p>We have a monorepo with scheduled Python data workflows, two Next.js apps, and a small engineering team. We use GitHub for SCM and CI/CD, deploy to GCP and Vercel, and lean heavily on automation.<p>Local development:\nEvery engineer gets Cursor Pro (plus Bugbot), Gemini Pro, OpenAI Pro, and optionally Claude Pro. We don’t really care which model people use. In practice, LLMs are worth about 1.5 excellent junior/mid-level engineers per engineer, so paying for multiple models is easily worth it.<p>We rely heavily on pre-commit hooks: ty, ruff, TypeScript checks, tests across all languages, formatting, and other guards. Everything is auto-formatted. LLMs make types and tests much easier to write, though complex typing still needs some hand-holding.<p>GitHub + Copilot workflow:\nWe pay for GitHub Enterprise primarily because it allows assigning issues to Copilot, which then opens a PR. Our rule is simple: if you open an issue, you assign it to Copilot. Every issue gets a code attempt attached to it.<p>There’s no stigma around lots of PRs. We frequently delete ones we don’t use.<p>We use Turborepo for the monorepo and are fully uv on the Python side.<p>All coding practices are encoded in .cursor/rules files. For example: “If you are doing database work, only edit Drizzle’s schema.ts and don’t hand-write SQL.” Cursor generally respects this, but other tools struggle to consistently read or follow these rules no matter how many agent.md-style files we add.<p>My personal dev loop:\nIf I’m on the go and see a bug or have an idea, I open a GitHub issue (via Slack, mobile, or web) and assign it to Copilot. Sometimes the issue is detailed; sometimes a single sentence. Copilot opens a PR, and I review it later.<p>If I’m at the keyboard, I start in Cursor as an agent in a Git worktree, using whatever the best model is. I iterate until I’m happy, ask the LLM to write tests, review everything, and push to GitHub. Before a human review, I let Cursor Bugbot, Copilot, and GitHub CodeQL review the code, and ask Copilot to fix anything they flag.<p>Things that are still painful:\nTo really know if code works, I need to run Temporal, two Next.js apps, several Python workers, and a Node worker. Some of this is Dockerized, some isn’t. Then I need a browser to run manual checks.<p>AFAICT, there’s no service that lets me: give a prompt, write the code, spin up all this infra, run Playwright, handle database migrations, and let me manually poke at the system. We approximate this with GitHub Actions, but that doesn’t help with manual verification or DB work.<p>Copilot doesn’t let you choose a model when assigning an issue or during code review. The model it uses is generally bad. You can pick a model in Copilot chat, but not in issues, PRs or reviews.<p>Cursor + worktrees + agents suck. Worktrees clone from the source repo including unstaged files, so if you want a clean agent environment, your main repo has to be clean. At times it feels simpler to just clone the repo into a new directory instead of using worktrees.<p>What’s working well:\nBecause we constantly spin up agents, our monorepo setup scripts are well-tested and reliable. They also translate cleanly into CI/CD.<p>Roughly 25% of “open issue → Copilot PR” results are mergeable as-is. That’s not amazing, but better than zero, and it gets to ~50% with a few comments. This would be higher if Copilot followed our setup instructions more reliably or let us use stronger models.<p>Overall, for roughly $1k/month, we’re getting the equivalent of 1.5 additional junior/mid engineers per engineer. Those “LLM engineers” always write tests, follow standards, produce good commit messages, and work 24/7. There’s friction in reviewing and context-switching across agents, but it’s manageable.<p>What are you doing for vibe coding in a production system?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

It takes a mental model of how different parts of the codebase interact to work successfully and they just don't do that. People talk about automating code review but the bugs I worry about can't be understood by an LLM. I don't need more comments based on surface level patter recognition, I need someone who deeply understands the threading model of the app to point out the subtle race condition in my code.

          "text": "Interesting. I treat VScode Copilot as a junior-ish pair programmer, and get really good results for function implementations. Walking it through the plan in smaller steps, noting that we’ll build up to the end state in advance ie. “first let’s implement attribute x, then we’ll add filtering for x later”, and explicitly using planning modes and prompts - these all allow me to go much faster, have good understanding of how the code works, and produce much higher quality (tests, documentation, commit messages) work. I feel like, if a prompt for a function implementation doesn’t produce something reasonable, then it should be broken down further. I don’t know how others define “vibe-coding”, but this feels like a lower-level approach. On the times I’ve tried automating more, letting the models run longer, I haven’t liked the results.

One practical question: presumably your codebase is much larger than an LLM's context window. How do you handle this? Don't the LLMs need certain files in context in order to handle most PRs?

Well, do you hold a 10 million line codebase in your head at once? Of course not. You have an intuitive grasp of how the system is built and laid out, and some general names of things, and before you make a change, you might search through the codebase for specific terms to see what shows up. LLMs do the same thing. They grep through the codebase and read in only files with interesting / matching terms and only the part of the file thats relevant, in much the same way you would open a search result and only view the surrounding method or so.  The context is barely used in these scenarios. Context is not something that’s static, it’s built dynamically as the conversation progresses via data coming from your system (partially through tool use). I frequently use LLMs in a VS Code workspace with around 40 repos, consisting of microservices, frontends, nuget and npm packages, IaC, etc. altogether its many millions of lines of code. and I can ask it questions about anything the codebase and it has no issues managing context. I do not even add files manually to context (this is worse actually because it puts the entire file  into context even if it’s not all used). I just refer to the files by name and the LLM is smart enough to read them in as appropriate. I have a couple JSON files that are megs of configuration, and I can tell it to summarize / extract examples out of those files and it’ll just sample sections to get an overview. reply",

Ironically, I have a terrible memory for a lot of other things, especially 'facts'. You can sorta make a crappy version of that for AI agents with agent files and skills. reply",

          "text": "We use claude code, running it inside a docker container (the project was already set up so that all the dev tools and server setup is in docker, making this easy); the interface between claude code and a developer is effectively the file system. The docker container doesn't have git credentials, so claude code can see git history etc and do local git ops (e.g. git mv) but not actually push anything without a review. Developers review the output and then do git add between steps, or instruct Claude to refactor until happy; then git commit at the end of a longer task. Claude.md just has 2 lines. the first points to @CONTRIBUTING.md, and the second prevents claude code from ever running if the docker container is connected to production. We already had existing rules for how the project is organized and how to write code and tests in CONTRIBUTING.md, making this relatively easy, but this file then co-evolved with Claude. Every time it did something unexpected, we'd tell it to update contributing rules to prevent something like that from happening again. After a while, this file grew considerably, so we asked Claude to go through it, reduce the size but keep the precision and instructions, and it did a relatively good job. The file has stabilized after a few months, and we rarely touch it any more. Generally, tasks for AI-assisted work start with a problem statement in a md file (we keep these in a /roadmap folder under the project), and sometimes a general direction for a proposed solution. We ask Claude code to an analysis and propose a plan (using a custom command that restricts plans to be composed of backwards compatible small steps modifying no more than 3-4 files). A human will read the plan and then iterate on it, telling Claude to modify it where necessary, and then start the work. After each step, Claude runs all unit tests for things that have changed, a bunch of guardrails (linting etc) and tests for the wider project area it's working in, fixing stuff if needed. A developer then reviews the output, requests refactoring if needed, does git add, and tells claude to run the next step. This review might also involve deploying the server code to our test environment if needed. Claude uses the roadmap markdown file as an internal memory of the progress and key conclusions between steps, and to help with restoring the progress after context resets. Pretty much after the initial review, Claude only uses this file, we don't look at it any more. Once done, this plan file is thrown away - tests and code remain. We occasionally ask it to evaluate if there are any important conclusions to record in the architectural design records or contributing guide. reply",

Your testing seems the bottleneck and you need to figure out how to decouple that system while preserving the safety of interfaces. How to do it depends heavily on the environment. Maybe look at design by contracts for some ideas? Things are going to get a lot better if you can start trying things out in a single project without requiring the whole environment and the kitchen sink.

          "text": "We've found success using a hybrid approach with LLMs in our codebase: 1. Context-aware prompting: We maintain a .ai-context folder with architecture docs, coding standards, and common patterns. Before asking the LLM anything, we feed it relevant context from these docs. 2. Incremental changes: Rather than asking for large refactors, we break tasks into small, testable chunks. This makes code review much easier and reduces the \"black box\" problem. 3. Test-first development: We ask the LLM to write tests before implementation. This helps ensure it understands requirements correctly and gives us confidence in the generated code. 4. Custom linting rules: We've encoded our team's conventions into ESLint/Pylint rules. LLMs respect these better than prose guidelines. 5. Review templates: We have standardized PR templates that specifically call out \"AI-generated code\" sections for closer human review. The key insight: LLMs work best as pair programmers, not autonomous developers. They're excellent at boilerplate, test generation, and refactoring suggestions, but need human oversight for architectural decisions. One surprising benefit: junior devs learn faster by reviewing LLM-generated code with seniors, compared to just reading documentation. reply",

Sometimes I will just \"rubber duck\" chat with it to get ideas. Inline code completion suggestions are completely disabled.  Tired of all the made up nonsense these things vomit out.  I only interact with an AI via either a desktop app, CLI agent, or the integrated agent in my IDE that I can keep hidden most of the time until I actively decide I want to use it.

          "text": "Your setup is interesting. I’ve had my mind on this space for a while now but haven’t done any deep work on a setup that optimizes the things I’m interested in. I think at a fundamental level, I expect we can produce higher quality software under budget. And I really liked how you were clearly thinking about cost benefits especially in your setup. I’ve encountered far too many developers that just want to avoid as much cognitive work as possible. Too many junior and mid devs also are more interested in doing as they are told instead of thinking about the problem for themselves. For the most part, in my part of the world at least, junior and mid-level devs can indeed be replaced by a claude code max subscription of around $200 per month and you’d probably get more done in a week than four such devs that basically end up using an llm to do work that they might not even thoroughly explore. So in my mind I’ve been thinking a lot about all aspects of the Software Development LifeCycle that could be improved using some llm or sorts. ## Requirements. How can we use llms to not only organize requirements but to strip them down into executable units of work that are sequenced in a way that makes sense. How do we go further to integrate an llm into our software development processes - be it a sprint or whatever. In a lot of green field projects, after designing the core components of the system, we now need to create tasks, group them, sequence them and work out how we go about assigning them and reviewing and updating various boards or issue trackers or whatever. There is a lot of gruntwork involved in this. I’ve seen people use mcps to automatically create tasks in some of these issue trackers based on some pdf of the requirements together with a design document. ## Code Review - I effectively spend 40% of my time reviewing code written by other developers and I mostly fix the issues I consider “minor” - which is about 60% of the time. I could really spend less time reviewing code with the help of an llm code reviewer that simply does a “first pass” to at least give me an idea of where to spend more of my time - like on things that are more nuanced. ## Software Design - This is tricky. Chatbots will probably lie to you if you are not a domain expert. You mostly use them to diagnose your designs and point out potential problems with your design that someone else would’ve seen if they were also domain experts in whatever you were building. We can explore a lot of alternate approaches generated by llms and improve them. ## Bugfixes - This is probably a big win for llms’ because there used to be a platform where I used to be able to get $50s and $30s to fix github bugs - that have now almost entirely been outsourced to llms. For me to have lost revenue in that space was the biggest sign of the usefulness of llms I got in practice. After a typical greenfield project has been worked on for about two months, bugs start creeping in. For apps that were properly architected, I expect these bugs to be fixable by existing patterns throughout the codebase. Be it removing a custom implementation to use a shared utility or other or simply using the design systems colors instead of a custom hardcoded one. In fact for most bugs - llms can probably get you about 50% of the way most of the time. ## Writing actual (PLUMBING) code . This is often not as much of a bottleneck as most would like to think but it helps when developers don’t have to do a lot of the grunt-work involved in creating source files, following conventions in a codebase, creating boilerplates and moving things around. This is an incredible use of llms that is hardly mentioned because it is not that “hot”. ## Testing - In most of the projects we worked on at a consulting firm, writing tests - whether ui or api was never part of the agreement because of the economics of most of our gigs. And the clients never really cared because all they wanted was working software. For a developing firm however, testing can be immense especially when using llms. It can provide guardrails to check when a model is doing something it wasn’t asked to do. And can also be used to create and enforce system boundaries especially in pseudo type systems like Typescript where JavaScript’s escape hatches may be used as a loophole. ## DEVOPS. I remember there was a time we used to manually invalidate cloudfront distributions after deploying our ui build to some e3 bucket. We’ve subsequently added a pipeline stage to invalidate the distribution. But I expect there are lots of grunt devops work that could really be delegated. Of course, this is a very scary use of llms but I daresay - we can find ways to use it safely ## OBSERVABILITY - a lot of observability platforms already have this feature where llms are able to review error logs that are ingested, diagnose the issue, create an issue on github or Jira (or wherever), create a draft PR, review, test it in some container, iterate on a solution X times, notify someone to review and so on and so forth. Some llms on this observability platform also attach a level of priority and dispatch messages to relevant developers or teams. LLms in this loop simply supercharge the whole observability/instrumentation of production applications But yeah, that is just my two cents. I don’t have any answers yet I just ponder on this every now and then at a keyboard. reply",

Above all, it's accessible to everyone, not just those on a specific platform. I've had a blog for almost 20 years. Nowadays, it's the best record I have of what I'm interested in and working on. It has recipes I send to my friends, context for strangers. It's a beacon that attracts similar people, a call for them to reach out. And it works! I get emails about my posts. I helped people travel along the same routes, and fixed people's technical issues. Another blog of mine turned into a lifestyle business. I have met countless friends and two lovers through it. So yeah, do your thing, put it online. Start simple, migrate as needed. I love static sites because they're low maintenance. Hugo and a theme would be good. reply",

Also, you have hands-on experience, which is also demonstrably more than any \"AI\" has. I urge you to ignore this kind of doubt or consideration. - What kinds of posts actually worked (for learning, career, network, opportunities)? For learning, \"book report\" type posts, just to solidify what I've read in my mind, maybe drive a little experimentation to ensure I've concluded correctly. I've decided not to collect any metrics so that I don't follow from behind, so that I don't end up doing clickbait. Career and network opportunities have not arisen from my blog. My \"public notebook\" posts get more traffic, and I've referred back to them, but for me, these are mostly Linux sysadmin topics. I'd wager these are most valuable to people that find them for very specific problems, like seeing LLDP info from inside a WiFi access point or fixing GRUB problems on particular hardware. - Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)? I have not discovered anything for this, alas. I use Hugo, I have a couple of little shell scripts to do monthly counts of finished vs draft articles. I try to stay at or above 5 posts a month. I'm not sure that helps lower the bar, which I interpret as \"provide motivation to post\". What would I do differently? Start a blog years before I actually did so.

The criminal justice system is where lurid fantasies of how tech works end up putting people in prison for sometimes years and budget concerns meant that attorneys filled parking meters every 4 hours and we had two full time investigators in an office of 40, most with a 80-120 caseload (rolling basis). Sometimes the data one puts online can really make an impact that my guess is that it was entirely unexpected and for two people in their 20s with young kids (separate cases, in fact, although not too far apart), it really reclaimed a good chunk of their lives. Thank you for that, and I hope others would do the same, because one never knows when it'll come in handy. So many products sold to LE are basically snake oil and without data and facts, the threat is incredibly coercive. Any leverage for defense helps balancing the playing field and frankly, nobody deserves to be taken to trial based on utter BS that has merit merely because it matches the equally unfounded anxieties of people, however unsubstantiated.Thanks again! reply",

You say you're not trying to build a media business, and want to build a \"public notebook\", but you imply you're looking for career/networking opportunities. You're also not clear if the \"learning\" is for you as the author, or for the reader. If you want to have your content discovered online, I'd say you might be in for some trouble, although I don't think AI is the cause, only an accelerator on that. Blogs for readers learning are probably in decline, you're unlikely to get any outreach based on your posts for networking. However if, like me, the writing process is the point – you're trying to clarify your thoughts, learn something new yourself, or have a document you can share with colleagues when they ask you to explain your opinions, I think blogging is valuable. While you won't get direct outreach, you can share it on your CV or send it to recruiters and you might get noticed when applying for jobs. reply",

None, probably less than 100 people have read it, I only share it in friend groups, but it feels nice when those friends read it and give me feedback. >Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)? What do you mean by \"lowers the bar\"? The length of my posts can be pretty variable, cadence is \"whenever\" and the blog can go months without an update, and themes are also pretty varied, sometimes I talk about some piece of fiction I like, other times it gets more technical, and sometimes too I just recount the process of making something and the insights it gave me. >If you were starting today, what would you do differently?

Write a diary for yourself if you want, fine, but what exactly are you gaining by putting it out there? It's even worse if you have to force yourself to do it, which appears to be the case here. Force yourself to exercise every day, because that's good for your physical health, but is blogging good for your health? Writing in public is performance art. Some people are naturally performance artists and need to perform to satisfy some internal urge. If you're not one of them, don't let anyone else convince you that you need to be one. It's ok to not blog. The idea that everyone should have a blog is completely unjustified. I read another comment that said you should write blog posts at least once a week.

I don’t have links to either anywhere on the internet and they are both hosted on micro.blog. I am a customer facing  staff cloud consultant (specializing in app dev - “application modernization”) and when I have new personal insight, I randomly ramble to ChatGPT and ask it to give me a “devils advocate” response or a “steel man’s response”.  I go back and forth and give it my responses. I ask it to write a blog post about our discussion.  I have instructions like no em dashes, no “not $x. But $y”.  No call to action etc. I still edit the output heavily.  Once I am satisfied, I post it to my blog. My blog doesn’t have my name attached to it anywhere or any contact information. I do review it sometimes. What I feel is a really good post after a bunch of edits and giving it  time to marinate, gets copied to LinkedIn - with no link back to my blog. Even then I don’t care about “engagement”.  It’s so I will have a corpus of well thought out posts if I am looking for a job later. The other types of posts are just links, with a quote from the article and if I saw the article on HN, I link to the comments. I don’t need network opportunities through my posts.  I’ve been in the tech industry for 30 years this coming June and I’ve been in consulting 6.  I have plenty of industry contacts and a solid reputation. FWIW:  the other blog is just recording my frequent travels and concerts with my wife. reply",

I should save it for later. So, I grab all of the info that sparked the comment and throw it into my drafts.

Besides that, I also use my blog as a way to document the various things I've learned, discovered, or setup for my home lab.

The posts that tend to compound aren’t “explainers.” They’re records of decisions, trade-offs, failures, and mental models you’ve actually tested. That’s where perspective comes from, and that’s the part AI can’t synthesize for you.

          "text": "Writing is difficult and like all art forms, it’s subject to impostor syndrome. Blogging is the best way I have found to remind yourself that you’re not an impostor. And the more experience you get proving you’re not an impostor, the easier impostor syndrome is to deal with. Realistically if you start now, you’re years away from a devoted readership and that’s fine. You’ll gain from publishing and if you’re diligent, you’ll gain from watching your writing improve. For me, I like writing and can’t get paid enough in publishing or as a writer to do it professionally. So it’s worth it for me because I have a lot of fun writing. I spent a good part of my life hunting for eyeballs and now I’m content just writing whether anyone reads it or not. I’m not sure that I’d recommend any particular theme, cadence or style for a new blogger. And I definitely wouldn’t recommend a style of post. Rather those sorts of things will come organically as you get used to writing and start building a community. When you’re getting started, just focus on writing, trying to build habits and learning how to edit yourself. Most writers will struggle with one of the three on their way to developing a voice so if you’re going through hell you’re likely on the right path. If I were starting today, I’d focus less on hunting eyeballs and more on writing for the joy of it. I’d also spend a lot more time writing about subjects that I’m not interested in because that’s really good practice. And finally, I wouldn’t worry so much about writer’s block - it happens, it sucks but it goes away when you stop worrying about it. On the subject of writer’s block, if it’s something you struggle with I have a great exercise for you. When you’re stuck, interview yourself about the finished piece you’re stuck on. Pretend it’s done and interview yourself. I would have started doing that twenty five years ago and I’d be a far better writer now because of it. Finally, keep everything you write and read it regularly but there’s nothing wrong with pruning your blog regularly. If things you wrote two years ago are embarrassing today that means you’re a better writer. Go with that. reply",

I'm the wrong person to ask about discoverability because I've been blogging for 22 years and I've accumulated 100,000+ followers on Twitter, 39,000 on Bluesky etc. It's worth offering an email subscribe mechanism. I didn't do that for the first ~20 years - I offered just an RSS feed - but when I added the Substack newsletter option it become clear I should have been gathering email addresses from a lot earlier on! Despite having a substantial audience visiting my site now I still think the best way to get traffic to an article is to tell people about it elsewhere. I follow the POSSE principle: publish on own site, syndicate elsewhere: https://indieweb.org/POSSE Honestly though quality is much more important than quantity. Join communities of like-minded individuals and make sure that a small number of engaged people get to see your stuff. Opportunities from that are likely to be more valuable than if you have a much larger audience who aren't as closely aligned with what you're publishing. reply",

          "text": "I started blogging long before AI became mainstream, but I'd say: totally worth it. Re blockers: - Novelty: I routinely search for very niche, \"boring\" information, and am disappointed by how few in-depth blogposts I find. - “AI can explain most topics better than I can”. I doubt it!  I rarely find current AI as valuable as a good blog post. It tends to be shallow and regress to the mean, and b/c of hallucinations it's untrustworthy, so a lot of time is wasted fact-checking. - Fear of shipping: if it isn't relevant, nobody will read it (unless you're already famous) Re questions: - What made it worth it for you? Clarifying my thoughts, connecting with strangers who think about the same things, the leverage \"having a platform\" produces (it opens a lot of doors), and gaining prestige in certain niches. - What kinds of posts actually worked (for learning, career, network, opportunities)? I don't think this is simple to answer until the heat death of the universe. Traffic stats is a very poor estimator of value delivered. Which posts I am most proud of, and how much traffic they got, are weakly correlated. - Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)? Things that you are obsessed with. It's a tonne of work writing a good post, and sometimes you publish it and nobody cares, so it has to be intrinsically rewarding. - If you were starting today, what would you do differently? I don't know! Probably put less effort into trying to appear intelligent/impressive, which rarely works anyway. These are my off-the-top thoughts based on over a decade of blogging. reply",

Too many to list such as jobs, recognition in the community, but the best ones are some sort of a personal satisfaction without the need to say anything aloud. The other two things I will always remember are (i) my cousin once accompanied me to a conference where I spoke, and after seeing the people lined/gathered around to talk, “What the heck are you, what do you do!” and (ii) recently, my daughter, “Papa, I searched you on Google and you are kinda Internet-famous, you are everything if I search your name.” > What kinds of posts actually worked (for learning, career, network, opportunities)? Two ways to look at it, (i) I don't care, I will just write or (ii) focus on a topic/community/vertical and keep writing about it, even if someone has written about it, write your own opinion.\nWatch for topic upticks in that vertical/interest and write about it, even if it means adding something to the ones that is already written. @simonw does it best https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/ > Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)? Make it open-ended. When you want and inspired, keep writing perhaps a long-form article or just stay short like @kepano https://stephango.com/style > If you were starting today, what would you do differently? Stay simple, minimal, comments optional/avoid. Separate content from your styles.

I haven't found a real way to solve these issues 100%, but it occurred to me that the odds of me having these problems would be lower if I paywalled my stuff or at least required registration for access. Free registration would not work if everyone did it the same way, but perhaps there is a way to have your own system that no crawler would bother trying to interface with. reply",

Here's one of mine, where in 2018 I look back on predictions made in 2012. Some held up well, some, it turned out, were physically impossible : https://benwheatley.github.io/blog/2018/07/17-16.09.05.html Naïve errors: Optical-wavelength metamaterial cloaking, fabric or otherwise, is not possible, the bandwidth is too narrow; Robot cars may be technically available in many countries, but they're sure not \"rapidly displacing human drivers because they are much safer and therefore cheaper to insure\". Close but no cigar: Nameplate solar power didn't reach par with global electricity use in 2024, but it did get to 1865 TW, which would have been 82% of global electricity use at the time I made the prediction. Actual global electricity use is 50% higher today than in 2012. Correct: China's GDP did in fact more than double between 2012 and 2022: https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=GDP+china+2022+%2F+GDP+... > •Any practical format that lowers the bar (length, cadence, themes)? Something you find interesting. Look at my blog and you won't only find deep thoughts, you'll also find this because it was fun at the time: https://benwheatley.github.io/blog/2018/12/21-09.27.02.html But not just jokes, because I'll also write about bioprinted fairy drones: https://benwheatley.github.io/blog/2021/05/22-21.06.36.html reply",

          "text": "As someone who spent 2+ years building one, I would turn away now if you're looking for traction or sustainability ( https://couplingcafe.com ). Though I don't regret it and learned enough to speak to my in-laws. My retention numbers are decent, but I just haven't done the marketing bit yet, and am currently taking a break. Language learning apps are the ultimate sand-pit for solo developers thinking they can offer some random unique feature that Duolingo (or \"Anki but better\") doesn't offer. Without realizing, they don't do it for a reason. Language learning has extremely low activation and retention. And it's super easy to find one or two early adopters that like your app for some reason to keep going. And solo developers that get into language learning often are only strong in software development and lack in UX, design, product, or marketing. You may start with a calm, \"not Duolingo gamification\" style app, but every language learning app starts with pure intentions until you're many months or years in, your numbers are low, you need to make money, and you need to move the needle. My two cents, you don't have to heed it obviously. reply",

Your biggest issue is going to be that language learning for adults is largely an unsolved problem. I know people with 1000+ day streaks on Duolingo who are nonetheless not fluent, and from everything I’ve read, it seems clear that spaced-repetition techniques are not sufficient (and possibly not necessary) to achieve fluency. Most people say you need immersion, which is difficult for an app to provide (research other people who have tried, you probably wouldn’t be the first and can save a lot of time, effort and heartbreak by learning from other people’s failures). reply",

I’ve been interested in these kinds of tools for a long time, but I feel some sense of urgency in the LLM era, where I’ve already seen peers lose their edge by offloading the cognitive work. I’ve been interested in these kinds of tools for a while, that actually act as a bicycle for the mind. Most apps forgo the metacognitive and emotional labor that actually helps people learn effectively in favor of gamification because 1. Modeling these skills is hard 2. The first step to building effective learning habits is to restore the so-called “learn drive” which is the love of learning, play, and tinkering that underlies most effective learning and gamification does so but on an artificial level. There is so much content out there, and a sufficiently motivated person will find it and make meaning out of it. Most people are not motivated and don’t know how to motivate, meander, explore without gritting teeth, and I think you’ll probably just see churn without gamification unless you deal with that side of the process. Since I've tried to ship such tools before and ultimately failed, I’m explicitly not doing the whole SV fail fast and iterate thing here: I’m meandering, taking my time, letting motivation move me when it strikes versus going for the easiest or most obvious thing. (also sorry if this is itself meandering: I’m lifting while typing this on my phone) reply",

I strongly dislike duolingo - it's gamification kept me pre-occupied for a while without noticing that I wasn't making any progress learning the language. When I figured that out, I felt cheated by the app! A long time ago I used a beta app that was being built by a high school teacher that I really enjoyed. It basically had a bunch on YouTube videos with a few different type of exercises. Unfortunately I had a busy schedule and couldn't keep up and I don't think the app was successful. My day job is development in the education space. If you care about building a learning app, read up on learning theory / pedagogy. A concept I really like wrt language learning is \"comprehensible input\". Other things to consider with languages is that hearing native speakers is extremely important. ps. wrt to gamification - I wish that people took the parts of games that I do like when they gamify an experience - open worlds, exploration, story telling, low stakes, save points, fun! reply",

The best two apps right now IMHO are Reading.com and Mentava, and they take radically different approaches. Mentava is pretty gamified and kids can use it on its own, whereas Reading.com is basically a computer implementation of Siegfried Engelmann's instructional approach. Has to be used with a parent accompaniment, and most of the onscreen widgets are just there to facilitate co-teaching. Both apps are good and seem to be landing with their target markets, obviously the simpler one is aiming at a lower price point. Poor gamification is a bigger risk than non-gamification done well IMHO. That's where a lot of children's learning apps have failed in the past. reply",

          "text": "I’ve been building a type of an educational app for the last 6 months. Spent 6 months building the product. Now I’m focusing on marketing and branding. I’ve spent last few weeks studying other successful educational products. And so far, from my research,  pretty much every single one of these apps/sites prioritized making the user “feel good” about learning rather than actually learning. And unfortunately, this is what the users want. They want to feel good about learning. All the successful education sites employ these mechanisms that you’re intending to avoid. I wanted to avoid using these as well - but I  just don’t see another way. I’ve even had users explicitly ask me to add milestones, streaks, etc to motivate them. Reality is - most people who really want to study or learn anything, can do so without an app. Even a book from a library will do. But it requires tremendous consistency, effort and time. Apps are way easier and make the user feel good - there’s still learning being done, don’t get me wrong. But user feeling good about it is what keeps them coming back. Edit: I’ve also studied many of their ads. Often times on places like TikTok, Instagram, etc their ads are what I would call “intelligence porn”. They get you excited about being more intelligent, investing in yourself, intelligence eliticism, etc. These were a common ad strategy that I have discovered so far. Some apps literally ran ads with text: “become dangerously intelligent” text and had the song from the show Succession play with images of famous researchers and scientists changing quickly. (Newton, Einstein, etc). Stuff like this cracked me up tbh lol. But apparently it works reply",

Every time the word \"gamification\" comes up in a conversation (with users, customers, internet posts), it reminds me of the quote from the great Charlie Munger \"Show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome\". Basically, gamification is supposed to incentivize the learner but a majority of training/learnings are unfortunately mostly about \"checking a box\" especially when it comes to required/regulated trainings (I mostly work with customers in these areas). So if you are building a learning app where learning is forced on the learner by someone else (their boss, employer, parent etc), then gamification won't be of any real use. No one will care if they just unlocked some imaginary points. On the other hand, my kids love learning in apps like Duolingo where they are proud of the \"streak\" they have for continuous number of days. But here is the thing. No one asked them to learn this stuff. They got interested (by watching a friend etc) and now they are playing the same game. reply",

This is cool, and I've auto-didacted a number of things with resources like this, and I know most here have as well. But, watching the interview with the Duolingo CEO linked in this thread, he's talking about reaching the far larger set of people that don't have strong intrinsic motivation to learn. Which is arguably a much more difficult and more important mission. The natural learners (and kids of white-collar parents) are already pretty well-equipped by the general state of the internet.

When I say \"container\" I mean, the bundle of forces that your product exerts to bring the user in contact with the content. Some learning products are just content with zero container. Books are the limit example. Karpathy's \"Let's build GPT\" is another. Most learning products -- and all apps -- live or die by the container they create. (There is no reason to build a learning app other than to build a container. If you feel you have the best content, ship it on a content platform and save yourself a very painful distribution slog. Duolingo is in the container game. Their container is made of every cheap trick in the book -- notifications, streaks, etc -- because they work. My startup was Hack Reactor, the coding bootcamp, and we did it with pair programming and fixed classroom hours. (We had great content, but our competitors with good containers and bad content did leagues better than vice versa.) If you're building an app, you're in the container game. You can build a great container with no cheap tricks. I have done so! But you can't build a great learning app with no container, and you can't build a great container if you if you don't want to change your users' patterns of engagement and attention. So, what is your container? How will you weave a powerful spell that meaningfully transforms the attention and engagement of the app's user? What will cause them to pull up your app again and again, when they would have churned from a simple anki deck or whatnot? Given that you find it distasteful to use the easy levers you mentioned (notifications, \"streak\" psychology), what alternatives can shift your users' patterns of attention and engagement towards the learning task? If you have great answers to those questions, great! If you don't want to build a container, build content on a platform with easy distribution. If you want to build a container but you don't want to shape your users' attention or engagement, you are confused. reply",

When they realise it was AOE cutscenes, and that the whole project was a backdoor to deliver historical knowledge to people. I feel like if you eschew gamification, your audience is largely only those with a deep interest of learning. I used an app to do a security cert a while back, and it would bug me 3 times a day, and challenge me to test my knowledge. I think it really helped keep my focus on the challenge. Likewise, when I was doing my CCNA years ago, the In-30-Days gentleman, would subscribe you to 30 days of motivational emails to read his book and practice the skills. Not an app, but the same sort of thing. Some people sell the motivation as the core product, some sell the game as the core product (to deliver motivation) and some people sell the knowledge as the core product. All are valid approaches just make sure you are happy with the market you are targeting. One more thing: I have absolutely no idea how to obtain calm in todays environment. I dont see myself engaging with an app that requires me to be calm ahead of time, but if it somehow strengthened or created a sense of calm that might be a sufficient product differentiator. reply",

          "text": "I don't think it's a mistake. Non-subscription without clear gamification and engagement tricks seems like Rosetta Stone basically and that's the longest-running, most effective language learning software I'm aware of. When I joined the Army 18 years ago, while waiting for school assignment, I had the opportunity to train provincial reconstruction teams as a role player and had to cram learn some reasonable level of conversational Pashtun and that was what we used, before smart phones were widely adopted. The only real innovation I've seen since then is conversational LLMs that allow you free-form practice without a human partner, but even back then, scripted conversational practice was pretty good as long as there was a wide enough diversity of scripts. Problem is more along the lines of \"solo developer\" here. Hacker News seems to have a real thing about this niche for whatever reason, but when doing something like this that I think requires real expertise in a wide variety of subjects that aren't software development, I think you need help. There's no way something like Rosetta Stone was developed without the input of experts in language learning and teaching, for instance. Knowing the platforms, programming languages, frameworks, and app store onboarding and delivery processes is already a lot for one person, but expecting to know the target domain on top of that is expecting an awful lot from yourself. I don't think it's a great sign trying to crowdsource business strategy from a free web discussion board, as a single example. This is the kind of conversation you want to have with your private team of people you know for sure have the experience they claim to have, not anonymous comments. reply",

There's certainly a market for \"calm\" learning, though you've already identified the main challenge: there's a smaller larger market for people who want to be educated than entertained, and the market for \"calm education\" is going to be an even smaller subset of that education market. Essentially you're looking for the people who are saying \"I want to be educated, but I'm not looking for the most efficient way to do it. I would prefer to move at a slower pace being driven purely by intrinsic motivation, rather than using extrinsic motivators in order to encourage me to move more quickly\" That market certainly exists, but it's a small enough niche that you'll likely have to be compete at a high price point to be viable. As point of comparison, Mentava costs $500/month, so if I were building a calm learning app (for an even smaller market), I would try to figure out a way justify an even higher price point than Mentava's. reply",

However, I do generally have a distaste for \"gamified\"  learning, and, separately, I feel distracted by things I feel are not very fulfilling, but are addicting (namely, scrolling through news, social media, or videos on my phone). I won't say what you are building is a mistake. But just based on what you described, if I were interested in learning a language through your app, I would not just be comparing it to other language learning apps, but I would also be comparing it to language textbooks/workbooks, classes at a community college or MOOC, or language courses on DVD/CD/YouTube/etc. I guess I think that apps are good at gamifying things, if that were to be a goal. If you are stripping that away, what makes your app unique compared to all those other resources? How does your app replace or supplement other things? And to be clear, I imagine there could be plenty of things that make your app unique! I just would want to know what those things are before diving in. reply",

          "text": "I'll give you one example, and you can decide for yourself. Mid of this year, I accidentally found out about a great independent language learning app [1]. It clicked for me. It was no bullshit, no gamification, and no distraction. I used it for one or two months, 700 hours in total. I can attribute to it some progress in learning my target language. Then I went on vacation for a few weeks and completely forgot about it. Today I tried to find it again, but since I forgot its name, I couldn't find it easily. Normally, I would search my inbox, but there was not a single mail from it. When I found it, I learned it improved quite a bit and added a way to support the app through subscriptions. Now, if it had some promotions or gamification built-in, I would be reminded of its existence and would most probably have been using it at least 700 more hours until today, and maybe even subscribed to it. And it would bring me closer to reaching the learning goal in my target language. TL;DR: Yes, some gamification or nagging is necessary. But don't overdo it. [1] https://morpheem.org/ reply",

However, due to the more user-driven approach to this learning method (output-focused, user has to put in effort to chat with the AI and get feedback), there is more friction with using the tool. This isn't necessarily a bad thing - in fact, more friction can lead to more meaningful experiences.

Among other things, dopamine is the learning hormone, it is a problem when it makes you learn the wrong things, like \"fentanyl is really great\", or \"I need to buy more stuff I don't need\", but it is also what helps you learn useful skills and life lessons. I remember my father, a teacher, who told me he viewed his job in the classroom as a performance art. His knowledge was secondary, if that's knowledge you want, just read a book, go to the internet, whatever, you don't need a teacher. But it is not very engaging, and a teacher's job is to make it more engaging. So without engagement, you probably won't make a good learning app, but you can make the engagement entirely targeted towards learning and not monetization, which would be a very good thing. reply",

          "text": "I think yes. If you don't create an obvious avenue for the user to infer his development, he won't be able to do it. \nYou have to confuse the audience to bring in the sense of progress. \nPeople learn by being challenged, confused, and by building something. Nobody learns by interfacing with an application that promises it. \nBut besides learning nothing, they can feel good about being engaged, by completing tasks, seeing progress bar moving, seeing number go up. \nSomeone that decides to interface with a learning app instead of learning the damn thing is doomed, will never learn anything at all. Just give them a sense of accomplishment so they can feel good about it. Without gamification what would the platform give them? \nIf don't help them cope with their inertia, there really is nothing you could do. \nMaybe you are equating gamification with dark patterns?\nGamification is not necessarily a bad thing. It is a powerful psychological trick. Can definitely be used for good. \nWorking on performance often feels amazing because we can profile, identify clear bottlenecks and work to reduce them. When you manage to make number go down, you have a clear indication something went right. Maybe you didn't absolutely improve de code, but you made it better in a very specific way under a very specific lens. People like it because of this aspect, and it does feel a little bit like a game. There is a clear requirement and a clear specification. The game aspect makes it very enjoyable. \nI suppose development against a test suite provides a similar experience. Feels good in a game-ish way. \nGamification is more related to the feels good than dark patterns, but obviously, the whole industry will ONLY be interested in exploiting practices. There is no incentive to make the user feel good, at all, without being pervasive. \nIf you care about your user, you should design around the user. Inevitably, you will think a bunch about what feels good. \nIf all you care about is the user learning, developing competence, you will offer no platform at all. The platform will tell them to close it and go do the thing.\nIf you want to motivate them, another story. If you want them to feel accomplished, another story. You're building a feels good, want to feel accomplished want to fool myself into learning app.s gamification is the whole point. reply",

Having said that, it's not like it's dead - it's a community of real people rather than an amalgamation of knowledge in a single tool. What sets SO apart and will always set it apart is that human aspect. For future problems that AI has no knowledge of, there will always be a group of people better equipped to answer questions through real life experience and deductions that AI simply cannot apply. I suspect in the next few years, SO will evolve into a platform that focuses on that human aspect because ultimately that's the only avenue I can see that would work. It's unlikely SO will die any time soon, it's more likely that the platform will find ways of pivoting to keep business flowing. It's not like SO is struggling for questions right now anyway, it continues to be a massively popular platform. Predicting the future is somewhat of a pointless task but I think it's safe to say, for now, that SO is still alive, and will be that way for a while at least. reply",

I studied that for a while, tried multiple carefully crafted Google queries until I found one that gave a good correct AI result, posted a reply NOT POSTING THE AI RESPONSE, that would break their rules, ONLY telling the person what query to do to get an answer and urged them to study and test this carefully, and I posted that. Moments later I got a stern warning that my post had been torn down, likely because their AI hunter bots had seen the word AI in it, almost certainly before the original poster ever saw this. Nobody else ever even tried to help the person. Later, only slightly related, I realized it had been most of a year since anyone posted a question in the little SO and SE corners that I used to watch and so I scanned my last five years of posting little mostly trivial attempts to help users, many of those were \"I think you've made a very simple mistake here..\", some of those probably resulted in trivial fixes, usually the person didn't even respond to me. SO I thought I'd raise the average quality of posts slightly by going through and deleting my trivial posts. On both SO and SE their hunter bots immediately flagged me for doing this and I got messages from both telling me that all the stuff I had tried to help people by putting up over the last 5-30 years WAS THEIRS (SO and SE) AND BELONGED TO THEM!!! And I believe they put back some or all of my trivial stuff. And I stopped watching SO and SE. reply",

          "text": "I'm a Stack Overflow elected moderator (one of these users: https://stackoverflow.com/users?tab=moderators ) First, a disclaimer: I do not speak for other elected moderators, nor for Stack Exchange Inc. My views are my own. Site traffic has been declining for a long time and that's not a mystery. Empirically, the rise of Large Language Models has sped up the decline or at least did not reverse the trend. This is both good and bad. Good because LLM's capture the vast majority of questions that would be quickly closed — underspecified, unclear, duplicate, not actually about programming, and so on. This increases the signal-to-noise ratio and average usefulness of SO questions. Bad because of all the implications of declining traffic that everyone can imagine. Is it dead? No. In fact, SO has a great opportunity to specialize in answering questions that LLMs cannot answer (bleeding edge technology, complex debugging problems, emerging issues, you name it.) The community is still alive. Whether Stack Exchange Inc. is able to understand and adapt to this shift is unclear. Company aside, the biggest challenge we moderators are facing is to identify and remove LLM-generated content. Keeping SO free of LLM-generated content is critical in helping the site maintain an edge against AI tools that provide quick and confident-sounding answers to whatever problem you throw at them. It's an uphill battle though, and one that is probably unwinnable, but the community hasn't given up yet. reply",

          "text": "Named ranges! Also newer Excel versions provide you the LET function, which is neat for documentation (naming) of intermediate steps: =LET(data; F4:F34;\n       dummy1; \"This is a made up average function; this string is ignored\";\n       dummy2; \"one limitation is that you cant really overwrite variable names\";\n       tally; COUNTA(data);\n       total; SUM(data);\n       total/tally) It also avoids recomputing intermediate stuff. You can also encapsulate things in a LAMBDA anonymous function: =LET(data; F4:F34;\n       mymeanfunction; LAMBDA(data;\n                              LET(tally; COUNTA(data);\n                                  total; SUM(data);\n                                  total/tally));\n       mean1; mymeanfunction(data);\n       mean2; mymeanfunction(OFFSET(data;0;1));doc;\"FIXME, this should have its own variable name to refer explicitly to G4:G34\";\n       AVERAGE(mean1;mean2)) You could also move the LAMBDA to the name registry and use that function similarly to how you would use a named range or a built-in formula! Coming from a lisp background, I was ecstatic to see this, but they have heavy technical limitations. I did play a little bit though with these concepts and the dynamic array functions. Fun functions to explore: - DROP, TAKE, CHOOSECOLS, CHOOSEROWS to cut arrays\n  - INDEX, OFFSET, COLUMN, ROW to navigate\n  - WRAPCOLS, WRAPROWS, TOROW, TOCOL, VSTACK, HSTACK, TRANSPOSE to shape arrays\n  - MAP, SCAN, REDUCE to compute on top of arrays There's more! reply",

Even with LET/LAMBDA, the structure still lives mostly in a single line of text,\nand the formula bar UI doesn’t really help you reason about that structure.\nThat’s the gap I’ve been curious about exploring. reply",

From memory: - Recursion is severely limited in lambda.\n  - There are extra pains when putting formulas on the name manager or on conditional formatting (although more focused on references than on lambdas in particular, usage of lambda would be more powerful if they didn't exist)\n  - You can't do arrays of arrays, so your data structures need to be flat reply",

          "text": "Do not want. Implants to regain communication or movement capabilities lost to brain injury are one thing. But since you asked about: > basically augmenting your cognition with AGI-cloud Being able to (somehow) mentally query the web (or some knowledge source) and wait for the result (which I imagine might be like touching an object to see if it is hot) would be maddening. I can imagine subjects getting stuck in loops, or the mental equivalent of doom-scrolling. The reward seeking mechanisms in our brains would just lock-on this stuff like mainlining a drug. As for just having knowledge just appear in your mind, effortlessly - this could be even worse. There would be no boundaries. What happens to everyday activities? If you look at a sunset (say) or the face of someone you love, what does the implant's overlay do to the subjective experience? Of anything? It would be like never being alone or being eternally distracted, only exponentially worse. I can easily imagine subjects being driven to psychosis or suicide. And, of course, there will be advertising and porn, and malware and memetic replicators. Because there always are. reply",

The headlining feature is it's ability to record visual sensation and memories through a proprietary Spatial Aperature located at the front and rear of the device. It runs all of your favorite apps in a secure environment; if anyone ever attempts to compromise or steal the iBrain, it enters a lockdown mode until a trusted technician can restore your unit. It's just another part of why consumers love the iBrain ecosystem. Of course, recording your thoughts is only a fraction of the power we could be harnessing with iBrain. When you log in, your most-recent memories will get synchronized with the cloud, and are catalogued on-device in a trusted compute environment. This makes it simple to collect and share your thoughts, whether it's with your iPad or friends online. Your ideas go places, and we want to appreciate that with the architecture of iBrain. We just know that consumers will love the iBrain. Our focus groups can't get enough of it, and we can't wait to open for pre-orders this September. reply",

          "text": "“Thinking in Systems” by Donella Meadows. It didn’t just teach me systems theory it permanently changed how I interpret cause and effect. I stopped seeing problems as isolated events and started seeing feedback loops, delays, leverage points, and unintended consequences everywhere: in businesses, politics, personal habits, even relationships. Once you internalize the idea that most outcomes are the result of system structure rather than individual intent, it’s impossible to go back to linear thinking. A close second would be “Gödel, Escher, Bach” by Douglas Hofstadter. It rewired how I think about self-reference, consciousness, and abstraction. After reading it, I began noticing recursive patterns across math, language, art, and software connections that felt invisible before. Both books didn’t give me answers; they changed the questions I ask. reply",

          "text": "I think there’s quite a few reasons people come. I’m just going to bullet some of them out in no particular order: - We do the work to find the restaurant and curate a menu, story, and theme. E.g., we might go to an Indian restaurant and focus the event on only the southern regional dishes. - Many times we have dishes that are off menu specially for our event. - Sense of community. We have quite a few regulars who have gotten to know each other. In 2025, 45 people reached their 20th or 30th event with us. Since we take over the whole restaurant there’s a little more freedom in how the space is used. Lots of new friendships have been forged. - When you go to a restaurant with a friend or small group, you can only order so much. We’ve had events with upwards of 25 different bites. There’s really no better way to sample everything the restaurant has to offer. - There’s a few people who say their partner are picky eaters, so they come to our event each month to have the opportunity to be a bit more adventurous. It’s an incredibly diverse group with a lot of different reasons to attend. reply",

          "text": "My partner and I divide and conquer. He focuses on front of house and I handle the backoffice. The process starts ~3 months before the event. We start by picking a theme or region. Then contact some restaurants that fit the criteria and pitch them the event. That kicks off the back and forth on cost and menu. Around 4 weeks before the event we send a save the date + previous event recap email. We summarize the last event and tease the next event, without giving away the actual resturant or type of food. Over the next week we prep the invite email and payment forms. This requires putting the dishes on our menu template, research and writing about the history of the dishes, the region, and the resturant. Some of this content also goes onto our website. Three weeks out we send the invite, which is a lottery system. Members have 5 days to request a seat and place a credit card hold. 5 days later we run the lottery (I wrote some basic software to randomize assignment, conver the card auth to capture and release any cards that didn't get assigned a ticket). Then we send an email to everyone who got in with which night they recieved and another email to anyone who was waitlisted. Everyone is added to a spreadsheet to track. 1 week before the event we send a reminder email and a last chance to cancel before the ticket is non refundable. At the event we play host and check each guest in and say hi to everyone. Then we give a prepared ~5 min intro about the food, restaurant, celebrate any milestone members, and make any general house keeping accounments. Our 20 club members get a branded apron. At the event we take video and pictures. Over the course of the next 4 weeks we post dish pictures with descriptions and history of the dish on our instagram. We also make a 1-2 min recap video of the event which also goes on our instagram and website. Separate from the actual event related work we have to manage the books, handle members emails, and review membership requests. More recently we started selling shirts, so there's a little work in managing that as well. reply",

Not sure how much it matters legally, but we are there as hosts and to drive the feeling of community. Without us, I don’t think the community has the same feel. We also have an unbelievably respectful and mature community. After over 70 seatings we’ve never had an incident. We also have a code of conduct document we send all new members. Second, we setup an LLC to shield us personally from legal liability. Third, not to say that it shields us, but the restaurants also have insurance and are a better target for a lawsuit. We are in the US, and at the end of the day anyone can sue anyone for anything. It’s just the reality and risk of the times. It hasn’t been a problem for us yet. reply",

We credit that with the transition from 1 or 2 degrees of separation to people we had no connection to. - There’s been a few influencers who have shown up and documented their experience.

The compute would differ, but loading speed shouldn't be an issue if you can render the HTML first, and hydrate it after page load. This static HTML would then also serve as fallback when Javascript is disabled. - For a quick demo, I doubt you will lose people by embedding an older version. Serving a version of a few months ago seems like 80% of the work, with 20% of the effort, in terms of deployment. Anyhow, nice to see government funds put to a good cause! reply",

          "text": "There's a really awesome site called Librivox [1], where volunteers narrate books that are in the public domain. Those recordings are also in the public domain as well (this is just part of the Librivox thing). The quality of those recordings (both the narration, and the actual recording quality) varies quite a bit and most of them aren't at a quality I'd expect people to pay for and thus aren't useable for me. I've spent hours and hours sorting through those recordings finding the best ones (from a narration perspective) and then improving the recording/audio quality on them. Those recordings have all mostly been made in the last 20yrs, so they're not old recordings of the books. So, the value I add to the Librivox recordings are: curation/selection, audio enhancement, and a much better delivery mechanism (IMHO). I'm also simultaneously building out our own library of original audio content by working with voice actors to get them recorded and proof read (this is a very expensive and time consuming process, but also very fun). One of the hardest parts is honestly the proofing process. Once I get finished narration files I have to compare them result with the actual script (as there are always mistakes) and request edits. I use whisper.cpp to transcribe them and then git and a few other scripts to compare the transcript with the actual book text. I'll also add that I _do not_ use AI Audio narration because it just doesn't sound good IMHO, and I personally hate listening to it. I regularly run experiments to see what the current state of the tech is and it's still pretty far from where it needs to be IMO. I also don't love the idea of AI swallowing absolutely everything. I appreciate the feedback and compliment! [1] https://librivox.org/ reply",

So in less than a day, I developed this Chrome extension: NotebookLM Web Importer[1], which allows for one-click importing. \nAs NotebookLM has gained popularity this year, my extension has also seen great growth. So, in July, I added paid premium features to unlock additional features. It exceeded my expectations and quickly went over $500 a month. It now has over 100,000 users and is still growing.

          "text": "Here’s my own side project that’s been earning a bit on the side: I built DedupX, a macOS app for finding duplicate and visually similar files fast - especially useful for photographers and anyone with big local storage collections. What it does - Exact duplicate detection using incremental hashing so it doesn’t have to fully load huge files. - Perceptual image matching finds similar images even if they’re resized or lightly edited (not just byte-for-byte duplicates). - Native macOS integration with a Finder right-click scan. Why I built it: My brother kept running out of space because of tons of photos, and every existing tool I tried either missed similar images or was slow and clunky - so I spent a couple of weekends building something that felt fast, accurate, and native. Business side - Free trial (no CC required). - Paid tiers: ~$5.99/yr or ~$16.99 lifetime. Got positive feedback and 100+ paying users shortly after launch. Been growing steadily ever since.

Attention spans will drop even lower, causing severe psychological problems. Think 'Digital Dementia 2.0.' Later, LLMs will be portrayed as something evil, yet everyone will still use them. Parents will use them, while telling their kinds not to do so. Leetcode is already standard for SWE interviews, but other industries will need to adopt similar tests to verify that an applicant's brain is functioning correctly and that they're capable of doing the job. Maybe a formal confirmation from a psychologist specializing in 'fried brains' will be required. reply",

You give a calculator a problem and it gives an easy answer thus involving no further work from the human brain which causes it to atrophy just like any other underused muscle. Just like a calculator can easily solve some problems so can AI. Sure the set of problems it can solve is bigger than a calculator. AI just enables you to work on bigger problems because you’re not spending so much time “calculating by hand”. If you delegate all your thinking to AI or you use AI when the point of the activity is to do the activity (ie homework at school) then I think you’ll see problems.

Value of experience will grow - compounding this will be less opportunity for junior people to get that experience so they will be increasingly (and rightly) frustrated. The opportunities to have a successful career as a salaried employee decline significantly - people are pushed to start small businesses out of necessity - and this barrier is lower due to AI.

          "text": "This is less of a prediction, more of how I see this industry progressing. I really feel \"web dev\" is going to get highly commoditized by GenAI, by web dev I mean 99% of building CRUD-adjacent apps, we are already seeing it now with tools like Claude Code etc, this pipeline is just going to get more refined, with tigther testing feedback loops, PR-workflows and a CI/CD deployment pipeline which the GenAI will control. This might be amplified by the fact the sheer amount of tested, high quality there is in the JavaScript-ecosystem for the AI to train on and learn from. Software engineering in general will tend more systems and embedded software, fields where GenAI can't perform well or can't be trusted to produce good code (I am thinking writing device drivers, or maintainence of legacy C applications) as well as deep research fields. The average software engineering job might be either that of a \"technical product manager\", or \"researcher\" or \"low-level systems expert\" That's just what I feel. Honestly, I am probably much younger an others on this forum, so I haven't really seen this industry \"evolve\" this is just how it looks to me now. I believe there was a time in the early 2010s where there was a boom of this \"generalist developer\" where if you knew your JavaScript-ecosystem (or App Dev ecosystem for that matter) pretty well, you could land a pretty decent job right out of college, or without a college degree at all. To me, at this stage the world in general needs software engineers who understand the \"world\" if that makes sense (in terms of physics, mathematics), or who have a really good mental model of computation. Better put, software engineering will become a tool in the larger context of research & development of tech that advance humanity. reply",

I mean, we have SRE, which is a whole set of skillsets in itself and it does involve around maintaining \"CRUD-apps\"; Heck there is the cybersec industry as well, ensuring CRUD-apps aren't exploited. My para was certainly a bit more 2D, I was speaking more from what I might benefit learning now, to get a job, say end of 2026. I have observed many roles like SRE etc, require certain experience which is hard to get by working on your own projects without much traction; similiar case for cybersec but to a lesser extent.

Yes that's true but I would argue this isn't because of AI itself. Sure it might have accelerated it but I have heard that in the 2020's a lot of people got a lot of jobs in the industry and then its that the market did feel saturated and in a sense, a lot of jobs feel this way in the economy where if someone has it, they continue having it but its becoming harder for new people to enter, there are financials reasons for this too mostly if i remember, interests rates are one of the core reasons That being said, Even though I have used LLM's a lot, I do not agree with your opinion and I am even younger than you most likely (17) A lot of people my age/people just going into college would use AI a lot to cheat but I will genuinely try to take it slow to learn things. I will try to use it as a learning tool and not as a crutch. Currently I am still in high school and I get ideas which I wish to implement but dont have the time because of exams so I test them out with LLM's but even I find the whole process frustrating at times and its just, maybe its me but there is a good ceiling that I can process. Some basic crud processes can definitely be in that but if your project is novel, even basic things can be hard I will give you an example, I recently tried creating an api for proton docs which worked by having browser instances. I had two basic scripts that worked on one platform and converted them to puppeteer using LLM and after it worked, I then asked it to simply create a very basic crud api on top of it Nope, I tried it 5-6 times on the best models on the market but they couldn't actively take two files which had read/write and have it work, either there was an issue in read or an issue in write I am fine with the project as it is right now and I am fine with the templates it has given me and I am going to build it now on top of it I had many ideas which could be considered basic crud apps like having a kanban app/github issues like ui on top of bitwarden after I saw a post here by simon saying how he uses github issues and that went semi-viral on hackernews Another issue is that I think just as how sure writers and similar can generate AI generated, I feel like there would be more trust on the non AI generated code. Personally I will try my best to create prototypes with AI and if I like them, I will see what it does and then rewrite them myself as an learning experience and also because people say spec driven development etc. but I just want to code things by hand at this point or convert the LLM generated prototypes of idea to something that I later code and understand by hand tbh (most likely when I get into college) reply",

          "text": "I wrote a lot. Let me add a tldr: any international trades happening in non-US dollar is an \"acceleration\" of dedollarizatiom, given that currently all trade is dollarized. Original: I don't known if I understand the spirit of the question. There are no metrics or tracking of how \"dollarized\" the international economy is because virtually all trade is done in dollars and there has been no risk of this changing for the past ?65? years My original prediction for 2026 ( not 2025, mind you) made in 2024 was based on a few factors, if I recall correctly, 1) the Russia-Ucraine war and related sanctions; 2) the open discussion in BRICS about trade in direct currencies; and 3) the then-promised isolatonist policies of Trump's second mandate. What we've seen in 2025 makes all of those stronger I guess. 1) I don't know the status of the Russia-Ucraine war; all I know is it is a glaring sign of the end of Pax Americana (as is the Israel-Palestine genocide/war, by the way, which the US would -not- have allowed given the strong internal opposition and negative popularity among the American public). So sanctions of Russia notwistanding, that status quo, which strongly related to dollar as reserve currency, is either agonizing or dead. 2) Trump and the US attempted a very strong response to the (first ever?) trades in local currency between Brazil and China, mostly in the form of targeted tariffs (all discourse about Bolsonaro and whatever being the motivation for tariffing Brazilian imports being, in my opinion, political smoke and mirrors). I don't think it worked. I think BRICS might press on this. If the mercosur/EU trade deal goes through it will also be a strong force towards trade in Euros/Reais/Pesos directly I believe. 3) I don't think I need to clarify; tariffs and other issues brought on by the current US government were severely negative to the placement of the US as a preferred trade partner. This is to beyond economic choice; active anti-american sentiment are at all times high in countries like Canada, Denmark, and Mexico, all historically aligned with the US. This may not seem that relevant but come election cycles in those and other countries we might see platforms/candidates that openly propose to \"secede\" from the US hegemony international order. If that happens, removing US military bases is a first go. Alternatives to the US \"petrodollar\" a close second. reply",

I looked up the Ford F-150 Lightning and a quote catches my eye: \"When the electric truck debuted in 2022, Russia had just invaded Ukraine, disrupting supplies of nickel, a key material in EV batteries.\" Raw materials and cost is a big part of the Chinese dominance on EVs and it'll continue to be on that side of the political sphere. Having to tariff China also emphasizes that they're gaining ground too quickly. They process about (over?) 80% of the major parts, so you can't fully tariff them either, only assembled cars or some parts. reply",

          "text": "Crypto, as an economic and innovation ecosystem, is largely dead, with the partial exception of stablecoins (which are not inherently “crypto” in the ideological/decentralized sense). The core issue is structural: most cryptocurrencies depend on foundations that fund development, marketing, and operations through large token holdings. When prices fall, these entities eventually become forced sellers. At some point, their “whale power” is not optional but necessary to survive, creating persistent sell pressure and undermining long-term trust. Bitcoin likely has a longer lifespan than most alternatives due to its lack of a foundation, fixed monetary policy, and social inertia. Over time, it may absorb whatever residual trust exists in the broader crypto space. However, that does not imply indefinite relevance: Bitcoin could survive while gradually becoming economically marginal, not dead, but increasingly negligible outside niche use cases. reply",

When there are no more greater fools to buy in, its value stops going up, so it loses value as a speculative asset. People will sell off to buy other speculative assets, causing a price drop and accelerating sell-off from others who do not want to be bag holders until the asset reaches its intrinsic utility value. Since Bitcoin is strictly worse than alternatives as a form of payment, that value is 0. While this is the ultimate price of Bitcoin, correctly estimating when it will happen requires an understanding of the addressable market, which can change sharply as different countries implement regulation. reply",

I'm self taught when it comes to computers and software development. For years before I landed a paying development job I did a lot of hobby projects. When I decided to take the leap and landed my first development job I took a fairly steep cut in pay. I was single, could afford the cut and was doing something I really wanted to do. It got the experience I needed and after the first year and changing jobs, my pay substantially increased. I realize not everyone can take the approach I took. It may not even work these days. I did this 38 years ago when the industry was a bit more accepting of developers without a college degree. Addendum: I also networked. I went to the equivalent of meet ups of the day. Talked with other developers, showed them my work, etc. This is how I found my first job. reply",

With ~17 years of experience already, start with the study of the structure of C programs. Recreate some of it manually, build it, and research the things that do not behave as expected. Bonus of using an open source kernel is they have a lot of eyeballs on them. They will be pretty dialed in versus studying random Github projects that happen to be written in C. Would recommend avoiding cognitive overload, wait until you get into comfortable flow writing, building, fixing as needed, simple programs before you dive into lower level debugging, trying to grasp assembly structures that a compiler spits out. reply",

Study how objects work, different forms of math, etc. And that's all console code btw - don't move onto GUIs until your console knowledge is solid. GUIs are a whole different beast in C/C++ (and are a big reason why frameworks like Electron were built). LLMs can also help you break into C development by a large degree.

Working for a small studio with flexible roles, I sometimes also take the opportunity to use other tech, like actual web stuff. A couple years ago I wrote a simple HTTP API for some internal needs and that was the first time I did modern web. I've worked in the embedded space and adjacent. I've done automotive (Autosar), I've done some bare metal applications and I've maintained a custom Linux system for a series of embedded products. I've also worked on tooling (native desktop applications) related to some of these embedded uses. For fun I still play with some embedded development, and would like to do another Android app. I built a couple simple ones years ago and generally Android development seems pretty pleasant to me, but I haven't done Android side projects in a long time because I can't really think of any apps I'd actually like to have. reply",

Once you get up to embedded Linux basically any language can be used. I have a really smart colleague who is interested in Zig but I’m hesitant to make such an investment without (1) the stronger guarantees of Rust and (2) the larger embedded dev community around Rust. At the end of the day we don’t usually write our own peripheral drivers anymore, so it’s important to have good BSP support for your language. So whatever you use, you usually have to wrap the C. This is even true of using C! The vendors libs are usually pretty bad and need wrapping with safety checks, or to be made so you can run more than one instance, etc. reply",

          "text": "Multimedia VoIP for hard of hearing / deaf-blind :) Working on a platform matching deaf video / text callers to interpreters, who then dial out to PSTN (phone network). Granted there is some web-stuff involved (one of the clients involved is Web-RTC), but it is mainly VoIP protocols among non-web or even 3rd party clients. Working with a stateful and complex protocol like SIP is fun and a pain. You need stateful load balancers, traffic routing can be tricky (f.ex. in k8s...), interoperability between providers is not trivial, etc. We also use relatively niche protocols for real-time text over RTP, which isn't (or until recently, hasn't been) supported in much VoIP software. This is starting to change due to EU legislation requiring accessibility in all commercial PSTN services, however. The market for this type of tech was very small ~15-20 years ago. Thus, the company was comitting to every possible sales lead, leaving a right mess in tech debt. So much of the work is handling and working around that... Much of the product pre-dates viable, affordable 3rd party technology, so there are home-grown components for all sorts of things: conferencing media component that also supports text, RTP proxies that were needed because few 3rd party clients supported ICE or TURN, etc. Stateful and complex protocols, with home-grown bespoke software components, 3rd party interoperability, 15-20 years  of technical debt, and changing customer demands.

The embedded system continually measures the voltage at each electrode, and can electrically stimulate the neurons via the same. Users are provided with an easy to use Python API that allows realtime observation of the raw signals and of detected action potentials (spikes). They can also execute precisely controlled stimulation sequences, which allows information to be presented to the neurons. Then there are a lot of higher level application APIs to handle things like recording data, real-time visualisation, and experiment config management. Why: it appears to be possible to teach neurons to perform tasks (we taught some to play pong several years ago).

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">When working on my projects and talking to investors, I often hear:\n“Just post it on Hacker News or Reddit and show that people love it.”<p>What I find strange is that Hacker News feels oddly opaque. I’ve never met anyone who can clearly explain how it works in practice. Not just the rules, but the dynamics: what’s repeatable, what’s luck, and what actually matters.<p>By using the Kevin Bacon-number idea: I can usually get within three degrees of separation of well-known technologists like Linus Torvalds, but I can’t seem to get within three steps of someone who confidently understands how HN works.<p>So I’m asking sincerely:\nDoes anyone here feel they understand Hacker News?\nIf so, what are the real levers, and what do people consistently misunderstand?<p>PS: This question comes from a mix of genuine curiosity and personal frustration. I’m honestly trying to understand how HN works in practice.</p></p></p></p></div>",

I've made friends here, have been helped by people on projects that I was busy with, did the reverse, found friends and business partners and spend way too much time. HN is a very interesting slice of the online world, a place that is unlike the rest, sometimes a bit dry but always interesting and extremely useful. If you're looking at it to try to understand it then you might as well try to understand a rat or a mouse. You won't understand it because it isn't there to be understood, it just is, like any other organism. The root of HN is a thing called 'startup news', that was changed very quickly and since then HN has been a focal point for techies of all sorts but also lots of other people from all walks of life and from a large variety of countries. It isn't 'one thing' to everybody that participates, just like a hammer is a different thing for a carpenter than it is for a masoner or a farmer. The fact that after being a member for a couple of years you have this question indicates a lack of participation, not a lack of understanding. reply",

          "text": "> Hacker news is there to promote ycombinator companies I should probably clarify this a bit. It's true that HN sponsors Launch HNs (and Show HNs) by YC startups. This is in the FAQ: https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html . However, YC would not be funding HN if that were the only reason for it. It's a secondary factor. Far more important than promoting existing startups is attracting founders who might start new startups. This requires an entirely different strategy than promotion: it requires being interesting enough to attract the right kind of users. That's why the site is organized around curiosity, as I explained elsewhere in the current thread ( https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46309399 ). For more on this, here are past explanations: optimizing for curiosity - https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&sor... relationship between HN and YC's business interests - https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=false&so... reply",

That's because giving “extra help” to YC-funded startups is far less valuable (to everyone including the startup themselves [1]) than just making HN interesting to readers and showcasing cool projects, no matter who has built them. [1] More than almost anything else, what I've learned from moderating HN is that “extra help” to get onto the front page of HN is of barely any help at all. That is, if the post isn't interesting enough to earn significant numbers of upvotes and good comments very quickly, it will disappear off the front page very quickly.

I've also seen people associated with YC backed companies here downvoted into the toilet for spouting unpopular opinions.

I've always been a fan of analyzing all of the flags retro-actively to see if they were just or not and to have a per-subject matrix that would weigh flags from particular users.

I think you're right that the cost of Hacker News is that my participation is lending some (tiny incremental) legitimacy to Y Combinator. It's also costing some tiny amount of my attention, in the sense that I may not have heard of Y Combinator if it weren't for Hacker News. For me personally, that is absolutely fine – but I'm glad you made it explicit so that it's a conscious choice.

That was an unexpected bonus. “To promote ycombinator” only works if there’s an audience worth promoting to. Building something great that brings people back day after day maybe has the result that it can also serve as a promotional tool - but that’s a bonus, not necessarily a purpose. I’m not the person you asked the question of - but I think the purpose of ycombinator is to give relevant people a place to discuss things aligned with the ecosystem in which ycombinator operates, to help strengthen and champion that ecosystem. Does it have a payoff for ycombinator? Almost certainly. Was it created with that explicit purpose in mind? I doubt it. There are easier ways to make money. reply",

Initially it was supposed to be a side project—an application to sharpen Arc on, and a place for current and future Y Combinator founders to exchange news._ _ Hacker News is an experiment, and an experiment in a very young field. Sites of this type are only a few years old. Internet conversation generally is only a few decades old. So we've probably only discovered a fraction of what we eventually will._ _ Hacker News is definitely useful. I've learned a lot from things I've read on HN. I've written several essays that began as comments there. So I wouldn't want the site to go away. But I would like to be sure it's not a net drag on productivity.

          "text": "First two sentences are key. The reason why HN is so much better than other fora (IMO) is that the mods don't allow lever-pulling and astroturfing to overtake regular contributions. Yet it's also popular, so you're bound to get some activity on most posts. Sure, it can be frustrating if you're trying to promote a product or farm karma on posts. But the fact that mostly nobody cares about karma means that you can post something and have it be evaluated on its technical, economic, social merits. Obviously, there are caveats to this - i.e., anything US- and FAANG-related is bound to get much more activity than otherwise - but the overall atmosphere of HN is refreshing compared to Reddit. reply",

          "text": "I can't know for sure. For me, it's just the \"eyeball method\" of comparing HN and different subreddits on Reddit. As to how I (or anyone) could show this, here are a few example questions: 1. How many examples of stealthy but otherwise blatant promotion do you see in the comments? Not every astroturfing campaign will be successful or original, so you'd be able to notice some patterns. Plus, HN is already commercially oriented, and there's the \"Show HN\" option, so it reduces the incentives for astroturfing. 2. Alternatively, how much controversy is there around the specific type of forum? For some subreddits, for example, you'd be able to see counter-subreddits popping up when participants feel the mods are abusing their power to promote one type of opinion. 3. Is a certain type of political/brand-related opinion or interpretation always at the top of your comment feed? For example, if upvotes determine the order of the comments, do you consistently see fewer critical comments on things that you'd expect the community to react to in different ways. 4. Do you consistently see some contributors having more power in discussions over others? Other than the mods, obviously. If this is the case, karma (i.e., number of upvotes) often has more value. Still, I could be wrong. reply",

          "text": "(I'm a mod here) It's true that this place can be cryptic, and that has downsides—specifically, it can be confusing to newcomers, even to some newcomers who would make ideal HN users. That sucks. But there's a key that unlocks most of the puzzles. That is to understand that we're optimizing for exactly one thing: curiosity. (Specifically, intellectual curiosity, since there are other kinds of curiosity too.) Here are links to past explanations about that: https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&sor... We try to elevate things that gratify curiosity: creative work, surprising discoveries, deep dives, technical achievements, unusual personal experience, whimsical unpredictability, good conversation, etc. And we try to demote things that run against curiosity, especially repetition, indignation, sensationalism, and promotion. It gets complicated because you'll also see plenty of repetition, indignation, sensationalism, and promotion on HN—alas! This is the internet after all. But the site survives because the balance of these things stays within tolerable ranges, thanks to two factors: an active community which cares greatly about preserving this place for intended purpose ( https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html ); and an owner (Y Combinator) that pays us to work on the site full time and mainly just wants us to keep it good, to the extent possible. If you really want to figure this place out, the way to do it is as a reader . Hang out on the site, look at the mix of articles that make the frontpage, spend time in the discussion threads (hopefully the interesting sectors and not the flamey ones!), and over time your eyes will adjust. What doesn't work—and this is good because we want it not to work—is approaching HN as a platform for promoting content. If you (<-- I don't mean you personally, but anyone) mainly care about \"how can I use this thing to get attention for my startup/blog/project/newsletter\", then you're operating in 'push' mode rather than 'pull' mode (or 'idle' mode, which is even better). In that case you won't be curious because you're too focused on what you're wanting for extraneous reasons—and if you aren't in a state of curiosity, this place won't make sense. At least we hope it won't! reply",

Honestly hackernews to me is a place where tinkering as a hobby is appreciated. I have read so many large threads here and ended up sometimes having a new point of view on something and so many posts here which make me want to be curious and tinker around too. I cannot really name something exactly which clicks on hackernews but that is what makes it unique and this does mean I cannot explain it to others sometimes since my hobbies are tangential to hackernews too, I just end up saying my hobby is tinkering with computers (currently only software) reply",

It's all the same arguments over and over, most of them without a shred of evidence. It feels like people aren't arguing in good faith any more, we're all just screaming our politics at (or past) each other. This didn't use to be the case.

There’s a handful of ideas we’re collectively mulling over at any given time. They slowly rotate in and out, and modulate into different keys as they go. For instance, the leading edge of LLM related discourse seems to be improving now that we’re getting bored with both hype and outrage, although there’s still plenty of hype and outrage. Old topics still occasionally blip into focus, but they don’t have the same staying power. Like, you’ll see a Rails post every now and then, but it’s not the darling it was. I doubt we’ll ever see the likes of “Rails is a Ghetto” make the rounds again, because nobody’s worked up about it any more. Or take Skrillex, who must have been on the front page every week for a month. I was annoyed at the time, but I think we’re due for a retrospective on programmers and dubstep. I’m not the one to write it though; not my scene in the first place. Anyway, thank you dang for your moderation! reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I have been noticing several issues with GitHub over the last few weeks, most of which used to work flawlessly a few months ago.<p>The outages aside, a couple of annoying, super-recent experiences:<p>- Our release process involves creating draft releases before QA, and publishing them when ready. We published a new release today and team members from the US were able to see it as published while members from different countries still saw the release marked as a draft and not visible publicly. We only noticed it two hours after making our announcements. We had to unpublish and publish it again to fix it.<p>- Recently, a colleague noticed a number of unrelated changes while reviewing a diff on GitHub, which led to us reverting a merge, only to later notice that the commit itself had no issues and it was the GitHub UI.<p>Outages and major issues are fine, they are loud and addressed directly. These kinds of issues go unnoticed, and they reduce trust silently.<p>I no longer trust the GitHub interface and actions. We had to re-test our release assets manually to make sure GH didn't mess that up.<p>Could this be yet another result of trusting AI code too much without proper review and testing? While discussing internally, one of my colleagues mentioned that \"the whole internet feels fragile lately\".<p>I'm curious to hear if anyone else has been facing such weird issues with GitHub.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Though I don't regret it and learned enough to speak to my in-laws. My retention numbers are decent, but I just haven't done the marketing bit yet, and am currently taking a break. Language learning apps are the ultimate sand-pit for solo developers thinking they can offer some random unique feature that Duolingo (or \"Anki but better\") doesn't offer. Without realizing, they don't do it for a reason. Language learning has extremely low activation and retention. And it's super easy to find one or two early adopters that like your app for some reason to keep going. And solo developers that get into language learning often are only strong in software development and lack in UX, design, product, or marketing. You may start with a calm, \"not Duolingo gamification\" style app, but every language learning app starts with pure intentions until you're many months or years in, your numbers are low, you need to make money, and you need to move the needle. My two cents, you don't have to heed it obviously. reply",

I’ve been interested in these kinds of tools for a long time, but I feel some sense of urgency in the LLM era, where I’ve already seen peers lose their edge by offloading the cognitive work. I’ve been interested in these kinds of tools for a while, that actually act as a bicycle for the mind. Most apps forgo the metacognitive and emotional labor that actually helps people learn effectively in favor of gamification because 1. Modeling these skills is hard 2. The first step to building effective learning habits is to restore the so-called “learn drive” which is the love of learning, play, and tinkering that underlies most effective learning and gamification does so but on an artificial level. There is so much content out there, and a sufficiently motivated person will find it and make meaning out of it. Most people are not motivated and don’t know how to motivate, meander, explore without gritting teeth, and I think you’ll probably just see churn without gamification unless you deal with that side of the process. Since I've tried to ship such tools before and ultimately failed, I’m explicitly not doing the whole SV fail fast and iterate thing here: I’m meandering, taking my time, letting motivation move me when it strikes versus going for the easiest or most obvious thing.

          "text": "That approach might be at odds with the market, but I don't think it's at odds with learning. I strongly dislike duolingo - it's gamification kept me pre-occupied for a while without noticing that I wasn't making any progress learning the language. When I figured that out, I felt cheated by the app! A long time ago I used a beta app that was being built by a high school teacher that I really enjoyed. It basically had a bunch on YouTube videos with a few different type of exercises. Unfortunately I had a busy schedule and couldn't keep up and I don't think the app was successful. My day job is development in the education space. If you care about building a learning app, read up on learning theory / pedagogy. A concept I really like wrt language learning is \"comprehensible input\". Other things to consider with languages is that hearing native speakers is extremely important. ps. wrt to gamification - I wish that people took the parts of games that I do like when they gamify an experience - open worlds, exploration, story telling, low stakes, save points, fun! reply",

The best two apps right now IMHO are Reading.com and Mentava, and they take radically different approaches. Mentava is pretty gamified and kids can use it on its own, whereas Reading.com is basically a computer implementation of Siegfried Engelmann's instructional approach. Has to be used with a parent accompaniment, and most of the onscreen widgets are just there to facilitate co-teaching. Both apps are good and seem to be landing with their target markets, obviously the simpler one is aiming at a lower price point. Poor gamification is a bigger risk than non-gamification done well IMHO. That's where a lot of children's learning apps have failed in the past. reply",

I’ve spent last few weeks studying other successful educational products. And so far, from my research,  pretty much every single one of these apps/sites prioritized making the user “feel good” about learning rather than actually learning. And unfortunately, this is what the users want. They want to feel good about learning. All the successful education sites employ these mechanisms that you’re intending to avoid. I wanted to avoid using these as well - but I  just don’t see another way. I’ve even had users explicitly ask me to add milestones, streaks, etc to motivate them. Reality is - most people who really want to study or learn anything, can do so without an app. Even a book from a library will do. But it requires tremendous consistency, effort and time. Apps are way easier and make the user feel good - there’s still learning being done, don’t get me wrong. But user feeling good about it is what keeps them coming back. Edit: I’ve also studied many of their ads. Often times on places like TikTok, Instagram, etc their ads are what I would call “intelligence porn”. They get you excited about being more intelligent, investing in yourself, intelligence eliticism, etc. These were a common ad strategy that I have discovered so far. Some apps literally ran ads with text: “become dangerously intelligent” text and had the song from the show Succession play with images of famous researchers and scientists changing quickly.

Basically, gamification is supposed to incentivize the learner but a majority of training/learnings are unfortunately mostly about \"checking a box\" especially when it comes to required/regulated trainings (I mostly work with customers in these areas). So if you are building a learning app where learning is forced on the learner by someone else (their boss, employer, parent etc), then gamification won't be of any real use. No one will care if they just unlocked some imaginary points. On the other hand, my kids love learning in apps like Duolingo where they are proud of the \"streak\" they have for continuous number of days. But here is the thing. No one asked them to learn this stuff. They got interested (by watching a friend etc) and now they are playing the same game. reply",

Its basically a curated set of flashcards, and the lessons are essentially flashcards themed together.  There are some extra explainers throw in that are helpful.  I really enjoyed it. On top of Mango as the primary lessons, I've been listening to podcasts, watching series in french, reading books, etc. I didn't pay anything for mango, it was entirely funded by my local library so that was great. reply",

This is cool, and I've auto-didacted a number of things with resources like this, and I know most here have as well. But, watching the interview with the Duolingo CEO linked in this thread, he's talking about reaching the far larger set of people that don't have strong intrinsic motivation to learn. Which is arguably a much more difficult and more important mission. The natural learners (and kids of white-collar parents) are already pretty well-equipped by the general state of the internet.

When I say \"container\" I mean, the bundle of forces that your product exerts to bring the user in contact with the content. Some learning products are just content with zero container. Books are the limit example. Karpathy's \"Let's build GPT\" is another. Most learning products -- and all apps -- live or die by the container they create. (There is no reason to build a learning app other than to build a container. If you feel you have the best content, ship it on a content platform and save yourself a very painful distribution slog. Duolingo is in the container game. Their container is made of every cheap trick in the book -- notifications, streaks, etc -- because they work. My startup was Hack Reactor, the coding bootcamp, and we did it with pair programming and fixed classroom hours. (We had great content, but our competitors with good containers and bad content did leagues better than vice versa.) If you're building an app, you're in the container game. You can build a great container with no cheap tricks. I have done so! But you can't build a great learning app with no container, and you can't build a great container if you if you don't want to change your users' patterns of engagement and attention. So, what is your container? How will you weave a powerful spell that meaningfully transforms the attention and engagement of the app's user? What will cause them to pull up your app again and again, when they would have churned from a simple anki deck or whatnot? Given that you find it distasteful to use the easy levers you mentioned (notifications, \"streak\" psychology), what alternatives can shift your users' patterns of attention and engagement towards the learning task? If you have great answers to those questions, great! If you don't want to build a container, build content on a platform with easy distribution. If you want to build a container but you don't want to shape your users' attention or engagement, you are confused. reply",

          "text": "In my opinion, such as it is, the best \"educational\" application made in the entire history of computing is Age of Empires. You can start a conversation with someone, and talk to them about say, the Saracens, and then have them start wondering how they came about their (small) understanding of them. When they realise it was AOE cutscenes, and that the whole project was a backdoor to deliver historical knowledge to people. I feel like if you eschew gamification, your audience is largely only those with a deep interest of learning. I used an app to do a security cert a while back, and it would bug me 3 times a day, and challenge me to test my knowledge. I think it really helped keep my focus on the challenge. Likewise, when I was doing my CCNA years ago, the In-30-Days gentleman, would subscribe you to 30 days of motivational emails to read his book and practice the skills. Not an app, but the same sort of thing. Some people sell the motivation as the core product, some sell the game as the core product (to deliver motivation) and some people sell the knowledge as the core product. All are valid approaches just make sure you are happy with the market you are targeting. One more thing: I have absolutely no idea how to obtain calm in todays environment. I dont see myself engaging with an app that requires me to be calm ahead of time, but if it somehow strengthened or created a sense of calm that might be a sufficient product differentiator. reply",

          "text": "I don't think it's a mistake. Non-subscription without clear gamification and engagement tricks seems like Rosetta Stone basically and that's the longest-running, most effective language learning software I'm aware of. When I joined the Army 18 years ago, while waiting for school assignment, I had the opportunity to train provincial reconstruction teams as a role player and had to cram learn some reasonable level of conversational Pashtun and that was what we used, before smart phones were widely adopted. The only real innovation I've seen since then is conversational LLMs that allow you free-form practice without a human partner, but even back then, scripted conversational practice was pretty good as long as there was a wide enough diversity of scripts. Problem is more along the lines of \"solo developer\" here. Hacker News seems to have a real thing about this niche for whatever reason, but when doing something like this that I think requires real expertise in a wide variety of subjects that aren't software development, I think you need help. There's no way something like Rosetta Stone was developed without the input of experts in language learning and teaching, for instance. Knowing the platforms, programming languages, frameworks, and app store onboarding and delivery processes is already a lot for one person, but expecting to know the target domain on top of that is expecting an awful lot from yourself. I don't think it's a great sign trying to crowdsource business strategy from a free web discussion board, as a single example.

There's certainly a market for \"calm\" learning, though you've already identified the main challenge: there's a smaller larger market for people who want to be educated than entertained, and the market for \"calm education\" is going to be an even smaller subset of that education market. Essentially you're looking for the people who are saying \"I want to be educated, but I'm not looking for the most efficient way to do it. I would prefer to move at a slower pace being driven purely by intrinsic motivation, rather than using extrinsic motivators in order to encourage me to move more quickly\" That market certainly exists, but it's a small enough niche that you'll likely have to be compete at a high price point to be viable. As point of comparison, Mentava costs $500/month, so if I were building a calm learning app (for an even smaller market), I would try to figure out a way justify an even higher price point than Mentava's. reply",

I won't say what you are building is a mistake. But just based on what you described, if I were interested in learning a language through your app, I would not just be comparing it to other language learning apps, but I would also be comparing it to language textbooks/workbooks, classes at a community college or MOOC, or language courses on DVD/CD/YouTube/etc. I guess I think that apps are good at gamifying things, if that were to be a goal. If you are stripping that away, what makes your app unique compared to all those other resources? How does your app replace or supplement other things?

          "text": "I'll give you one example, and you can decide for yourself. Mid of this year, I accidentally found out about a great independent language learning app [1]. It clicked for me. It was no bullshit, no gamification, and no distraction. I used it for one or two months, 700 hours in total. I can attribute to it some progress in learning my target language. Then I went on vacation for a few weeks and completely forgot about it. Today I tried to find it again, but since I forgot its name, I couldn't find it easily. Normally, I would search my inbox, but there was not a single mail from it. When I found it, I learned it improved quite a bit and added a way to support the app through subscriptions. Now, if it had some promotions or gamification built-in, I would be reminded of its existence and would most probably have been using it at least 700 more hours until today, and maybe even subscribed to it. And it would bring me closer to reaching the learning goal in my target language. TL;DR: Yes, some gamification or nagging is necessary. But don't overdo it. [1] https://morpheem.org/ reply",

          "text": "I've been using these fundamentals (calm, non-gamified, emphasis on focus & flow) for building a Mandarin language learning via chat with AI. My goal was to give the user a focused tool (i.e. chat with an AI at your level) and let them experiment & play at their own pace. However, due to the more user-driven approach to this learning method (output-focused, user has to put in effort to chat with the AI and get feedback), there is more friction with using the tool. This isn't necessarily a bad thing - in fact, more friction can lead to more meaningful experiences. That being said, I believe the market will push tools to be low friction and low effort (i.e. gamified apps) that are focused on consumption rather than tools that require more user effort. just my 2c from a fellow builder. if curious, check it out here! would love any feedback https://koucai.chat reply",

Among other things, dopamine is the learning hormone, it is a problem when it makes you learn the wrong things, like \"fentanyl is really great\", or \"I need to buy more stuff I don't need\", but it is also what helps you learn useful skills and life lessons. I remember my father, a teacher, who told me he viewed his job in the classroom as a performance art. His knowledge was secondary, if that's knowledge you want, just read a book, go to the internet, whatever, you don't need a teacher. But it is not very engaging, and a teacher's job is to make it more engaging. So without engagement, you probably won't make a good learning app, but you can make the engagement entirely targeted towards learning and not monetization, which would be a very good thing. reply",

If you don't create an obvious avenue for the user to infer his development, he won't be able to do it. \nYou have to confuse the audience to bring in the sense of progress. \nPeople learn by being challenged, confused, and by building something. Nobody learns by interfacing with an application that promises it. \nBut besides learning nothing, they can feel good about being engaged, by completing tasks, seeing progress bar moving, seeing number go up. \nSomeone that decides to interface with a learning app instead of learning the damn thing is doomed, will never learn anything at all. Just give them a sense of accomplishment so they can feel good about it. Without gamification what would the platform give them? \nIf don't help them cope with their inertia, there really is nothing you could do. \nMaybe you are equating gamification with dark patterns?\nGamification is not necessarily a bad thing. It is a powerful psychological trick. Can definitely be used for good. \nWorking on performance often feels amazing because we can profile, identify clear bottlenecks and work to reduce them. When you manage to make number go down, you have a clear indication something went right. Maybe you didn't absolutely improve de code, but you made it better in a very specific way under a very specific lens. People like it because of this aspect, and it does feel a little bit like a game. There is a clear requirement and a clear specification. The game aspect makes it very enjoyable. \nI suppose development against a test suite provides a similar experience. Feels good in a game-ish way. \nGamification is more related to the feels good than dark patterns, but obviously, the whole industry will ONLY be interested in exploiting practices. There is no incentive to make the user feel good, at all, without being pervasive. \nIf you care about your user, you should design around the user. Inevitably, you will think a bunch about what feels good. \nIf all you care about is the user learning, developing competence, you will offer no platform at all. The platform will tell them to close it and go do the thing.\nIf you want to motivate them, another story. If you want them to feel accomplished, another story. You're building a feels good, want to feel accomplished want to fool myself into learning app.s gamification is the whole point. reply",

Also newer Excel versions provide you the LET function, which is neat for documentation (naming) of intermediate steps: =LET(data; F4:F34;\n       dummy1; \"This is a made up average function; this string is ignored\";\n       dummy2; \"one limitation is that you cant really overwrite variable names\";\n       tally; COUNTA(data);\n       total; SUM(data);\n       total/tally) It also avoids recomputing intermediate stuff.

Coming from a lisp background, I was ecstatic to see this, but they have heavy technical limitations. I did play a little bit though with these concepts and the dynamic array functions. Fun functions to explore: - DROP, TAKE, CHOOSECOLS, CHOOSEROWS to cut arrays\n  - INDEX, OFFSET, COLUMN, ROW to navigate\n  - WRAPCOLS, WRAPROWS, TOROW, TOCOL, VSTACK, HSTACK, TRANSPOSE to shape arrays\n  - MAP, SCAN, REDUCE to compute on top of arrays There's more! reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Here’s how we’re working with LLMs at my startup.<p>We have a monorepo with scheduled Python data workflows, two Next.js apps, and a small engineering team. We use GitHub for SCM and CI/CD, deploy to GCP and Vercel, and lean heavily on automation.<p>Local development:\nEvery engineer gets Cursor Pro (plus Bugbot), Gemini Pro, OpenAI Pro, and optionally Claude Pro. We don’t really care which model people use. In practice, LLMs are worth about 1.5 excellent junior/mid-level engineers per engineer, so paying for multiple models is easily worth it.<p>We rely heavily on pre-commit hooks: ty, ruff, TypeScript checks, tests across all languages, formatting, and other guards. Everything is auto-formatted. LLMs make types and tests much easier to write, though complex typing still needs some hand-holding.<p>GitHub + Copilot workflow:\nWe pay for GitHub Enterprise primarily because it allows assigning issues to Copilot, which then opens a PR. Our rule is simple: if you open an issue, you assign it to Copilot. Every issue gets a code attempt attached to it.<p>There’s no stigma around lots of PRs. We frequently delete ones we don’t use.<p>We use Turborepo for the monorepo and are fully uv on the Python side.<p>All coding practices are encoded in .cursor/rules files. For example: “If you are doing database work, only edit Drizzle’s schema.ts and don’t hand-write SQL.” Cursor generally respects this, but other tools struggle to consistently read or follow these rules no matter how many agent.md-style files we add.<p>My personal dev loop:\nIf I’m on the go and see a bug or have an idea, I open a GitHub issue (via Slack, mobile, or web) and assign it to Copilot. Sometimes the issue is detailed; sometimes a single sentence. Copilot opens a PR, and I review it later.<p>If I’m at the keyboard, I start in Cursor as an agent in a Git worktree, using whatever the best model is. I iterate until I’m happy, ask the LLM to write tests, review everything, and push to GitHub. Before a human review, I let Cursor Bugbot, Copilot, and GitHub CodeQL review the code, and ask Copilot to fix anything they flag.<p>Things that are still painful:\nTo really know if code works, I need to run Temporal, two Next.js apps, several Python workers, and a Node worker. Some of this is Dockerized, some isn’t. Then I need a browser to run manual checks.<p>AFAICT, there’s no service that lets me: give a prompt, write the code, spin up all this infra, run Playwright, handle database migrations, and let me manually poke at the system. We approximate this with GitHub Actions, but that doesn’t help with manual verification or DB work.<p>Copilot doesn’t let you choose a model when assigning an issue or during code review. The model it uses is generally bad. You can pick a model in Copilot chat, but not in issues, PRs or reviews.<p>Cursor + worktrees + agents suck. Worktrees clone from the source repo including unstaged files, so if you want a clean agent environment, your main repo has to be clean. At times it feels simpler to just clone the repo into a new directory instead of using worktrees.<p>What’s working well:\nBecause we constantly spin up agents, our monorepo setup scripts are well-tested and reliable. They also translate cleanly into CI/CD.<p>Roughly 25% of “open issue → Copilot PR” results are mergeable as-is. That’s not amazing, but better than zero, and it gets to ~50% with a few comments. This would be higher if Copilot followed our setup instructions more reliably or let us use stronger models.<p>Overall, for roughly $1k/month, we’re getting the equivalent of 1.5 additional junior/mid engineers per engineer. Those “LLM engineers” always write tests, follow standards, produce good commit messages, and work 24/7. There’s friction in reviewing and context-switching across agents, but it’s manageable.<p>What are you doing for vibe coding in a production system?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

But my day job is maintaining messy legacy code which breaks because of weird interactions across a large codebase. LLMs are worse than useless for this. It takes a mental model of how different parts of the codebase interact to work successfully and they just don't do that. People talk about automating code review but the bugs I worry about can't be understood by an LLM. I don't need more comments based on surface level patter recognition, I need someone who deeply understands the threading model of the app to point out the subtle race condition in my code. Tests, however, are self-contained and lower stakes, so it can certainly save time there. reply",

          "text": "Interesting. I treat VScode Copilot as a junior-ish pair programmer, and get really good results for function implementations. Walking it through the plan in smaller steps, noting that we’ll build up to the end state in advance ie. “first let’s implement attribute x, then we’ll add filtering for x later”, and explicitly using planning modes and prompts - these all allow me to go much faster, have good understanding of how the code works, and produce much higher quality (tests, documentation, commit messages) work. I feel like, if a prompt for a function implementation doesn’t produce something reasonable, then it should be broken down further. I don’t know how others define “vibe-coding”, but this feels like a lower-level approach. On the times I’ve tried automating more, letting the models run longer, I haven’t liked the results.

My impression was that LLMs are not yet robust enough to produce quality, maintainable code when let loose like this. But it sounds like you are already having more success than I would have guessed would be possible with current models. One practical question: presumably your codebase is much larger than an LLM's context window. How do you handle this? Don't the LLMs need certain files in context in order to handle most PRs? E.g. in order to avoid duplicating code or writing something in a way that's incompatible with how it will be used upstream. reply",

          "text": "One thing I think people confuse with context is they see an LLM has say 400k context and think their codebase is way bigger than that, how can it possibly work. Well, do you hold a 10 million line codebase in your head at once? Of course not. You have an intuitive grasp of how the system is built and laid out, and some general names of things, and before you make a change, you might search through the codebase for specific terms to see what shows up. LLMs do the same thing. They grep through the codebase and read in only files with interesting / matching terms and only the part of the file thats relevant, in much the same way you would open a search result and only view the surrounding method or so.  The context is barely used in these scenarios. Context is not something that’s static, it’s built dynamically as the conversation progresses via data coming from your system (partially through tool use). I frequently use LLMs in a VS Code workspace with around 40 repos, consisting of microservices, frontends, nuget and npm packages, IaC, etc. altogether its many millions of lines of code. and I can ask it questions about anything the codebase and it has no issues managing context. I do not even add files manually to context (this is worse actually because it puts the entire file  into context even if it’s not all used). I just refer to the files by name and the LLM is smart enough to read them in as appropriate. I have a couple JSON files that are megs of configuration, and I can tell it to summarize / extract examples out of those files and it’ll just sample sections to get an overview. reply",

Then I need a browser to run manual checks. There's your problem. It doesn't matter how you produce the code in this environment. Your testing seems the bottleneck and you need to figure out how to decouple that system while preserving the safety of interfaces. How to do it depends heavily on the environment. Maybe look at design by contracts for some ideas? Things are going to get a lot better if you can start trying things out in a single project without requiring the whole environment and the kitchen sink. Solving this would improve a lot of things, including LLM success and iteration speed since you could make changes in one place and know which other systems are going to be affected.

          "text": "We use claude code, running it inside a docker container (the project was already set up so that all the dev tools and server setup is in docker, making this easy); the interface between claude code and a developer is effectively the file system. The docker container doesn't have git credentials, so claude code can see git history etc and do local git ops (e.g. git mv) but not actually push anything without a review. Developers review the output and then do git add between steps, or instruct Claude to refactor until happy; then git commit at the end of a longer task. Claude.md just has 2 lines. the first points to @CONTRIBUTING.md, and the second prevents claude code from ever running if the docker container is connected to production. We already had existing rules for how the project is organized and how to write code and tests in CONTRIBUTING.md, making this relatively easy, but this file then co-evolved with Claude. Every time it did something unexpected, we'd tell it to update contributing rules to prevent something like that from happening again. After a while, this file grew considerably, so we asked Claude to go through it, reduce the size but keep the precision and instructions, and it did a relatively good job. The file has stabilized after a few months, and we rarely touch it any more. Generally, tasks for AI-assisted work start with a problem statement in a md file (we keep these in a /roadmap folder under the project), and sometimes a general direction for a proposed solution. We ask Claude code to an analysis and propose a plan (using a custom command that restricts plans to be composed of backwards compatible small steps modifying no more than 3-4 files). A human will read the plan and then iterate on it, telling Claude to modify it where necessary, and then start the work. After each step, Claude runs all unit tests for things that have changed, a bunch of guardrails (linting etc) and tests for the wider project area it's working in, fixing stuff if needed. A developer then reviews the output, requests refactoring if needed, does git add, and tells claude to run the next step. This review might also involve deploying the server code to our test environment if needed. Claude uses the roadmap markdown file as an internal memory of the progress and key conclusions between steps, and to help with restoring the progress after context resets. Pretty much after the initial review, Claude only uses this file, we don't look at it any more. Once done, this plan file is thrown away - tests and code remain. We occasionally ask it to evaluate if there are any important conclusions to record in the architectural design records or contributing guide. reply",

This helps ensure it understands requirements correctly and gives us confidence in the generated code. 4. Custom linting rules: We've encoded our team's conventions into ESLint/Pylint rules. LLMs respect these better than prose guidelines. 5. Review templates: We have standardized PR templates that specifically call out \"AI-generated code\" sections for closer human review. The key insight: LLMs work best as pair programmers, not autonomous developers. They're excellent at boilerplate, test generation, and refactoring suggestions, but need human oversight for architectural decisions. One surprising benefit: junior devs learn faster by reviewing LLM-generated code with seniors, compared to just reading documentation. reply",

          "text": "Your setup is interesting. I’ve had my mind on this space for a while now but haven’t done any deep work on a setup that optimizes the things I’m interested in. I think at a fundamental level, I expect we can produce higher quality software under budget. And I really liked how you were clearly thinking about cost benefits especially in your setup. I’ve encountered far too many developers that just want to avoid as much cognitive work as possible. Too many junior and mid devs also are more interested in doing as they are told instead of thinking about the problem for themselves. For the most part, in my part of the world at least, junior and mid-level devs can indeed be replaced by a claude code max subscription of around $200 per month and you’d probably get more done in a week than four such devs that basically end up using an llm to do work that they might not even thoroughly explore. So in my mind I’ve been thinking a lot about all aspects of the Software Development LifeCycle that could be improved using some llm or sorts. ## Requirements. How can we use llms to not only organize requirements but to strip them down into executable units of work that are sequenced in a way that makes sense. How do we go further to integrate an llm into our software development processes - be it a sprint or whatever. In a lot of green field projects, after designing the core components of the system, we now need to create tasks, group them, sequence them and work out how we go about assigning them and reviewing and updating various boards or issue trackers or whatever. There is a lot of gruntwork involved in this. I’ve seen people use mcps to automatically create tasks in some of these issue trackers based on some pdf of the requirements together with a design document. ## Code Review - I effectively spend 40% of my time reviewing code written by other developers and I mostly fix the issues I consider “minor” - which is about 60% of the time. I could really spend less time reviewing code with the help of an llm code reviewer that simply does a “first pass” to at least give me an idea of where to spend more of my time - like on things that are more nuanced. ## Software Design - This is tricky. Chatbots will probably lie to you if you are not a domain expert. You mostly use them to diagnose your designs and point out potential problems with your design that someone else would’ve seen if they were also domain experts in whatever you were building. We can explore a lot of alternate approaches generated by llms and improve them. ## Bugfixes - This is probably a big win for llms’ because there used to be a platform where I used to be able to get $50s and $30s to fix github bugs - that have now almost entirely been outsourced to llms. For me to have lost revenue in that space was the biggest sign of the usefulness of llms I got in practice. After a typical greenfield project has been worked on for about two months, bugs start creeping in. For apps that were properly architected, I expect these bugs to be fixable by existing patterns throughout the codebase. Be it removing a custom implementation to use a shared utility or other or simply using the design systems colors instead of a custom hardcoded one. In fact for most bugs - llms can probably get you about 50% of the way most of the time. ## Writing actual (PLUMBING) code . This is often not as much of a bottleneck as most would like to think but it helps when developers don’t have to do a lot of the grunt-work involved in creating source files, following conventions in a codebase, creating boilerplates and moving things around. This is an incredible use of llms that is hardly mentioned because it is not that “hot”. ## Testing - In most of the projects we worked on at a consulting firm, writing tests - whether ui or api was never part of the agreement because of the economics of most of our gigs. And the clients never really cared because all they wanted was working software. For a developing firm however, testing can be immense especially when using llms. It can provide guardrails to check when a model is doing something it wasn’t asked to do. And can also be used to create and enforce system boundaries especially in pseudo type systems like Typescript where JavaScript’s escape hatches may be used as a loophole. ## DEVOPS. I remember there was a time we used to manually invalidate cloudfront distributions after deploying our ui build to some e3 bucket. We’ve subsequently added a pipeline stage to invalidate the distribution. But I expect there are lots of grunt devops work that could really be delegated. Of course, this is a very scary use of llms but I daresay - we can find ways to use it safely ## OBSERVABILITY - a lot of observability platforms already have this feature where llms are able to review error logs that are ingested, diagnose the issue, create an issue on github or Jira (or wherever), create a draft PR, review, test it in some container, iterate on a solution X times, notify someone to review and so on and so forth. Some llms on this observability platform also attach a level of priority and dispatch messages to relevant developers or teams. LLms in this loop simply supercharge the whole observability/instrumentation of production applications But yeah, that is just my two cents. I don’t have any answers yet I just ponder on this every now and then at a keyboard. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I've been on a business trip this week, and sitting on the plane, I was randomly browsing NYT and read this article which really REALLY pissed me off: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/14/us/fire-department-software-private-equity.html?unlocked_article_code=1.8k8.yzeR.NwSK3PTQeXQj&amp;smid=nytcore-android-share<p>TLDR: Private equity is buying up all these software vendors, and preying upon vulnerable fire departments; one rural department with a total budget of $130k/yr saw their software costs go up 3x in one year (from $4k/yr to $12k/yr).<p>I want to do something. I have not worked in the emergency services domain before, so I know that I am naive. I do have experience with oncall and mission-critical software maintenance and highly available/durable services, but when I say mission critical I mean millions-of-dollars at risk, not human lives.<p>I want to solicit HN for very early directional advice, of any and all kinds.<p>- Are there some existing open source projects or foundations with a mission like this, to serve and protect critical services like emergency response?<p>- Is it feasible to build incrementally, i.e. ship small components of incremental value, and would fire departments be open to trying an open source option?<p>- Are there things like certifications or regulatory hurdles, that might be expensive to get?<p>- Does anyone randomly happen to have experience in this industry, and would be willing to write up their perspective?<p>My early initial thesis is something like this: I personally cannot stomach the idea of simply passively \"letting\" private equity invade this aspect of society, to hold emergency services departments and by extension taxpayers hostage. They are essentially extorting and exploiting society's inelastic demand for emergency fucking services. So I don't care about making profit, I only care about actually solving the needs of the emergency departments and of protecting human life (knowing that I am naive still, I definitely do not want to overpromise and put lives at risk). But my personal feelings aside, I do think there is a useful insight here: if useful software can be made reliably and cheaply, by engineers motivated to help their communities  instead of profit (or just to poke private equity in the eye), then ultimately private equity cannot compete against an adversary that doesn't care about profit -- we actually CAN WIN, because eventually they will give up and exit these industries if they see that there is no profit to squeeze.<p>I am looking for like-minded builders. I seriously think the software foundation could simply be a vehicle for early-retirement rich FIREd ex-techies, to add some new purpose in their lives, by using their skills to solve a targeted and well-scoped set of problems.<p>\"Some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned, or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world [NOT] burn [because the fire departments should have cheap reliable emergency services software].\" -- Alfred Pennyworth, The Dark Knight<p>\"Beware the fury of a patient man.\" -- John Dryden<p>I am a patient man, with a newly gained cold fury. I am willing to write code. Or organize a software foundation. Or be an investor/funder for someone else to write the software. Or whatever form of help I can give.<p>Appreciate any and all help or feedback (positive or negative)!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Having said that, it's not like it's dead - it's a community of real people rather than an amalgamation of knowledge in a single tool. What sets SO apart and will always set it apart is that human aspect. For future problems that AI has no knowledge of, there will always be a group of people better equipped to answer questions through real life experience and deductions that AI simply cannot apply. I suspect in the next few years, SO will evolve into a platform that focuses on that human aspect because ultimately that's the only avenue I can see that would work. It's unlikely SO will die any time soon, it's more likely that the platform will find ways of pivoting to keep business flowing. It's not like SO is struggling for questions right now anyway, it continues to be a massively popular platform. Predicting the future is somewhat of a pointless task but I think it's safe to say, for now, that SO is still alive, and will be that way for a while at least. reply",

My views are my own. Site traffic has been declining for a long time and that's not a mystery. Empirically, the rise of Large Language Models has sped up the decline or at least did not reverse the trend. This is both good and bad. Good because LLM's capture the vast majority of questions that would be quickly closed — underspecified, unclear, duplicate, not actually about programming, and so on. This increases the signal-to-noise ratio and average usefulness of SO questions. Bad because of all the implications of declining traffic that everyone can imagine. Is it dead? No. In fact, SO has a great opportunity to specialize in answering questions that LLMs cannot answer (bleeding edge technology, complex debugging problems, emerging issues, you name it.) The community is still alive. Whether Stack Exchange Inc. is able to understand and adapt to this shift is unclear. Company aside, the biggest challenge we moderators are facing is to identify and remove LLM-generated content. Keeping SO free of LLM-generated content is critical in helping the site maintain an edge against AI tools that provide quick and confident-sounding answers to whatever problem you throw at them. It's an uphill battle though, and one that is probably unwinnable, but the community hasn't given up yet. reply",

I studied that for a while, tried multiple carefully crafted Google queries until I found one that gave a good correct AI result, posted a reply NOT POSTING THE AI RESPONSE, that would break their rules, ONLY telling the person what query to do to get an answer and urged them to study and test this carefully, and I posted that. Moments later I got a stern warning that my post had been torn down, likely because their AI hunter bots had seen the word AI in it, almost certainly before the original poster ever saw this. Nobody else ever even tried to help the person. Later, only slightly related, I realized it had been most of a year since anyone posted a question in the little SO and SE corners that I used to watch and so I scanned my last five years of posting little mostly trivial attempts to help users, many of those were \"I think you've made a very simple mistake here..\", some of those probably resulted in trivial fixes, usually the person didn't even respond to me. SO I thought I'd raise the average quality of posts slightly by going through and deleting my trivial posts. On both SO and SE their hunter bots immediately flagged me for doing this and I got messages from both telling me that all the stuff I had tried to help people by putting up over the last 5-30 years WAS THEIRS (SO and SE) AND BELONGED TO THEM!!! And I believe they put back some or all of my trivial stuff. And I stopped watching SO and SE. reply",

I really want to help my user, but I don't like this code in my codebase. If you don’t want to accept the PR, don’t. It’s still your project. Reject it politely. Tell them why you don’t feel comfortable accepting it (too many changes at once; impractical to review; general distrust of LLM code; …) but remind them that “of course, if you want to keep that in your own fork, you’re more than welcome”. I’ve been doing that for years (way before vibe coding was a thing) and was always able to keep good relations with my users. Be polite and make sure they understand your rejection is not an indictment on their submission, while reassuring them that the effort was not wasted because they can keep it for their own use if they really want it that bad. > This morning, I received another message from another user who is about to submit one more feature.
