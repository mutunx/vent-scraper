          "text": "As a very early CUDA programmer who participated in the cudacontest from NVidia during 2008 and I believe one of the only entries (I'm not claiming though) to be submitted from India and got a consolation and participation prize of a BlackEdition Card, I can vouch the method which I followed. - Look up the CUDA Programming Guide from NVidia - CUDA Programming books from NVidia from developer.nvidia.com/cuda-books-archive link - Start creating small programs based on the existing implementations (A strong C implementation knowledge is required. So, brush up if needed.) - Install the required Toolchains, compilers, and I am assuming you have the necessary hardware to play around - Github links with CUDA projects. Read the code, And now you could use LLM to explain the code in the way you would need - Start creating smaller, yet parallel programs etc., etc., And in about a month or two, you should have enough to start writing CUDA programs. I'm not aware of the skill / experience levels you have, but whatever it might be, there are plenty of sources and resources available now than it was in 2007/08. Create a 6-8 weeks of study plan and you should be flying soon! Hope it helps. Feel free to comment and I can share whatever I could to guide. reply",

          "text": "A 5-year old card, i.e. an NVIDIA Ampere RTX 30xx from 2020, is perfectly fine. Even 7-year old cards, i.e. NVIDIA Turing RTX 20xx from 2018, are still acceptable. Older GPUs than Turing should be avoided, because they lack many capabilities of the newer cards, e.g. \"tensor cores\", and their support in the newer CUDA toolkits will be deprecated in a not very distant future, but very slowly, so for now you can still create programs for Maxwell GPUs from 10 years ago. Among the newer GPUs, the RTX 40xx SUPER series (i.e. the SUPER variants, not the original RTX 40xx series) has the best energy efficiency. The newest RTX 50xx GPUs have worse energy efficiency than RTX 40xx SUPER, so they achieve a somewhat higher performance only by consuming a disproportionately greater power. Instead of that, it is better to use multiple RTX 40xx SUPER. reply",

          "text": "I looked at the CUDA code for Leela Chess Zero and found it pretty understandable, though that was back when Leela used a DCNN instead of transformers.  DCNN's are fairly simple and are explained in fast.ai videos that I watched a few years ago, so navigating the Leela code wasn't too difficult.  Transformers are more complicated and I want to bone up on them, but I haven't managed to spend any time understanding them. CUDA itself is just a minor departure from C++, so the language itself is no big deal if you've used C++ before.  But, if you're trying to get hired programming CUDA, what that really means is they want you implementing AI stuff (unless it's game dev).  AI programming is a much wider and deeper subject than CUDA itself, so be ready to spend a bunch of time studying and hacking to come up to speed in that.  But if you do, you will be in high demand.  As mentioned, the fast.ai videos are a great introduction. In the case of games, that means 3D graphics which these days is another rabbit hole.  I knew a bit about this back in the day, but it is fantastically more sophisticated now and I don't have any idea where to even start. reply",

This is something that changes with times and trends. 2. Learning high-performance computing approaches. While a GPU and the Nvlink interfaces are Nvidia specific, working in a massively-parallel distributed computing environment is a general branch of knowledge that is translatable across HPC architectures. 3. Application specifics. If your thing is Transformers, you may just as well start from Torch, Tensorflow, etc. and rely on the current high-level abstractions, to inspire your learning down to the fundamentals. I’m no longer active in any of the above, so I can’t be more specific, but if you want to master CUDA, I would say learning how massive-parallel programming works, is the foundation that may translate into transferable skills. reply",

          "text": "I will give you personal experience learning CUDA that might be helpful. Disclaime: I don't claim that this is actually a systematic way to learn it and it is more for academic work. I got assigned to a project that needs learning CUDA as part of my PhD. There was no one in my research group who have any experience or know CUDA. I started with standard  NVIDIA courses (Getting Started with Accelerated Computing with CUDA C/C++ and there is python version too). This gave me good introduction to the concepts and basic ideas but I think after that I did most of learning by trial and error. I tried a couple of online tutorials for specific things and some books but it was always a deprecated function there or here or a change of API that make things obsolete. Or basically things changed for your GPU and now you have to be careful because yoy might be using GPU version not compatible with what I develop for in production and you need things to work for both. I think learning CUDA for me is an endeavor of pain and going through \"compute-sanitizer\" and Nsight because you will find that most of your time will go into debugging why things is running slower than you think. Take things slowly. Take a simple project that you know how to do without CUDA then port it to CUDA ane benchmark against CPU and try to optimize different aspect of it. The one advice that can be helpful is not to think about optimization at the beginning. Start with correct, then optimize.  A working slow kernel beats a fast kernel that corrupts memory. reply",

          "text": "I can share a similar PhD story (the result being visible here: https://github.com/NX-AI/flashrnn ). Back then I didn't find any tutorials that cover anything beyond the basics (which are still important).\nOnce you have understood the principle working mode and architecture of a GPU, I would recommend the following workflow:\n1. First create an environment so that you can actually test your kernels against baselines written in a higher-level language.\n2. If you don't have an urgent project already, try to improve/re-implement existing problems (MatMul being the first example). Don't get caught by wanting to implement all size cases. Take an example just to learn a certain functionality, rather than solving the whole problem if it's just about learning.\n3. Write the functionality you want to have in increasing complexity. Write loops first, then parallelize these loops over the grid. Use global memory first, then put things into shared memory and registers. Use plain matrix multiplication first, then use mma (TensorCore) primitives to speed things up.\n4. Iterate over the CUDA C Programming Guide. It covers all (most) of the functionality that you want to learn - but can't be just read an memorized. When you apply it you learn it.\n5. Might depend on you use-case but also consider using higher-level abstractions like CUTLASS or ThunderKitten. Also, if your environment is jax/torch, use triton first before going to CUDA level. Overall, it will be some pain for sure. And to master it including PTX etc. will take a lot of time. reply",

          "text": "I had a bit, limited, exposure to cuda. It was before the AI boom, during Covid. I found it easy to start. Then there was a pretty nice learning curve to get to warps, SM's and basic concepts. Then I was able to dig deeper into the integer opcodes, which was super cool. I was able to optimize the compute part pretty well, without much roadblocks. However, getting memory loads perfect and then getting closer to hw (warp groups, divergence, the L2 cache split thing, scheduling), was pretty hard. I'd say CUDA is pretty nice/fun to start with, and it's possible to get quite far for a novice programmer. However getting deeper and achieving real advantage over CPU is hard. Additionally there is a problem with Nvidia segmenting the market - some opcodes are present in _old_ gpu's (CUDA arch is _not_ forwards compatible). Some opcodes are reserved to \"AI\" chips (like H100). So, to get code that is fast on both H100 and RTX5090 is super hard. Add to that a fact that each card has different SM count and memory capacity and bandwidth... and you end up with an impossible compatibility matrix. TLDR: Beginnings are nice and fun. You can get quite far on the optimizing compute part. But getting compatibility for differnt chips and memory access is hard. When you start, chose specific problem, specific chip, specific instruction set. reply",

The skills needed for CUDA are completely unrelated to building machine learning models. It's like learning to make a TLS library so you can get a full stack web development job. The skills are completely orthogonal. CUDA belongs to the domain of game developers, graphics people, high performance computing and computer engineers (hardware). From the point of view of machine learning development and research, it's nothing more than an implementation detail. Make sure you are very clear on what you want. Most HR departments cast a wide net (it's like how every junior role requires \"3-5 years of experience\" when in reality they don't really care). Similarly when hiring, most companies pray for the unicorn developer who can understand the entire stack from the GPU to the end user product domain when the day to day is mostly in Python. reply",

          "text": "For better or worse, direct professional experience in a professional setting is the only way to learn anything to a professional level. That doesn't mean one-eyed-king knowledge is never enough to solve that chicken-and-egg. You only have to be good enough to get the job. But if you haven't done it on the job, you don't have work experience and you are either lying to others or lying to yourself...and any sophisticated organization won't fall for it... ...except of course, knowingly. And the best way to get someone to knowingly ignore obvious dunning-kruger and/or horseshit is to know that someone personally or professionally. Which is to say that the best way to get a good job is to have a good relationship with someone who can hire you for a good job (nepotism trumps technical ability, always). And the best way to find a good job is to know a lot of people who want to work with you. To put it another way, looking for a job is the only way to find a job and looking for a job is also much much harder than everything that avoids looking for a job  (like studying CUDA) by pretending to be preparation...because again, studying CUDA won't ever give you professional experience. Don't get me wrong,  there's nothing wrong with learning CUDA all on your own. But it is not professional experience and it is not looking for a job doing CUDA. Finally, if you want to learn CUDA just learn it for its own sake without worrying about a job. Learning things for their own sake is the nature of learning once you get out of school. Good luck. reply",

          "text": "> often you can pay by card at the pump. That’s definitely an innovation that creates convenience but does it really change the commercial function of the station much?  You are still essentially transacting for fuel, which is what gas stations have done for decades.  My guess is while a lot of stations provide that ability out of customer demand, but the owners would probably rather the customer come in and buy the over priced soda and Doritos along with the gas purchase.  I don’t think owner-operators make hardly anything on the fuel sales. With my comment I was thinking more along the lines of overall footprint of the station and what products are being sold.  I think self-service pushed the ability for stations to service more pumps and with a person anchored to a register inside instead of outside attending to the pumps, it allowed the ability of stations to expand to more a mini-mart concept easily where more profitable products (to the station owner) are sold. EV charging might help bring people into the food, but i suspect you don’t “turn tables” fast enough to make EV charging beneficial enough to bringing enough people inside to warrant devoting a lot of space to that activity. reply",

          "text": "I know my view will be affected by the UK being generally a small country... most people aren't driving 200+ miles a day, which means 90% of charging will be at home. Driving longer that 200 miles means you probably want a decent break. So I would imagine that most \"local\" places will disappear / pivot into shops with EV charging also. Motorway services will also change I think. Fast food isnt as much of an appeal when you're stuck there for an hour or so anyway. So I could see a rise in retrain complexes with charging abilities. possibly changes in behaviour will also affect things. If im traveling 4-6hrs in a day, id be ok with stopping of for an hour at a shopping centre where I could charge and also do some shopping, maybe let the kids play in a softplay or whatever The first clever folks to stick a bull ring within 5 minutes drive of the M6 will 200+ charging points will do VERY well I think. reply",

          "text": "The process has already begun - UK petrol station numbers are down by a third since the beginning of the century. As you say, they'll all but cease to exist in urban areas, with the process mostly complete by the end of the 2030s. I'm not sure that dedicated EV charging stations will be all that common in cities, though. Why not use existing car parks for that? Some probably will end up being used as surface car parks where there's demand for it, but urban land values are such that I suspect most will be knocked down and replaced with apartments or larger retail units. A few may retain the forecourt structures as a form of kitsch (think of the florists beside Regents Park in London, or the Hyde Park Book Club in Leeds). There'll probably be a growing niche for domestic fuel delivery services. You might also see a minor resurgence of the very small neighbourhood filling stations that mostly died out in the 1970s/80s - the sort of place that does MOT checks or tyre changes today. Some might end up installing a pump or two, to cater for vintage car enthusiasts. reply",

Who wants to stand in line to change out propane, to be told there's only one person working, go out and wait til the line is gone?  Air is still free, but you have to go in and ask for it to be turned on. At least that's my experience, maybe each locale is different.

No matter what, only a very few people can be accommodated at once. On the flip side, setting up a gas station is hard, but that’s not the case with EV charging stations — especially if battery swapping is innovated. It also takes time to deeply penetrate the market, but EV charging is much more suitable for two-wheelers. So there’s a clear gap — the current gas stations can’t handle the volume of people waiting for EV charging. What is the way forward? I feel anyone with an EV charger can set up an EV charging station at home. This means all your malls, houses, and parks might be converted into EV charging stations, making it much more decentralized. I anticipate that anyone with an EV charger and good parking space can make some extra bucks from it. I feel the whole idea of gas stations might be democratized.

All vehicles are plugged in and the software needs to charge different vehicles up at different times and rates, in order to spread the load. It is far easier to dig a hole in the ground and fill a tank with delivered fuel - all the logistics for this already exists. * Maximum demand is a well-known concept that relates to the maximum current draw in a 30-minute period, which is used to provide the necessary infrastructure from the electricity supplier. reply",

These fleets have been quasi electric since the 1970s They move slowly on dedicated predictable paths all controlled by the same system that choreographs their movements, controls who goes in for system charges.  Some of them are EV in the sense they use electricity but they have no batteries.  More of them now have batteries but they can in no way be compared to the usage patterns of human use cases.  This is why batteries have been viable for them since the 70's.  Massive inefficient monsters on slow moving controlled paths.   Some of them charge whilst moving using massive cables laid out in the roads in the mine.  In a mine slow and steady wins the race.  In the rest of the world it would be chaos or more specifically not viable. Big-rigs also make sense as the fleet owned and controlled trucks can charge at dedicated yards and will all move in coordinated efforts. There are still no viable 3500 through 7500 series trucks operated by small to medium business owners and those run the short haul of many industries in the USA.  As such the diesel versions of them will be around for a very long time.  I keep an eye on battery tech for my own selfish reasons and have yet to see anything that would power those trucks without pushing them over their weight limits to the point of making them legally unusable.  As is business owners skirt the line when they are on the scales.  Heavy batteries would require them to cut their loads and effectively also eat their profits and waste a lot of their time making multiple trips.  If they become viable I will see it right away as I am surrounded by them and business owners will do what makes financial sense.  I will be the first to change opinions on this when it is a profitable option. The closest I have yet to see in Science Fiction levels of battery improvement is 3D printed solid state batteries and they have a long way to go just to make it into tools, cell phones, etc...  That needed to happen a decade ago if we want to see them in big trucks within 15 years.  I would love to be proven wrong ... for my own selfish reasons unrelated to electric vehicles. reply",

          "text": "By 2040, I suspect not much will have changed. In the US, most engines that required leaded gasoline rolled off the assembly lines in the 1960s, with the legal phase-out beginning in the 1970s, and finally ending in the 1990s. As I have a classic car that I intend to keep running, I suspect eventually (e.g. not by 2040), buying fuel for it will be similar to buying pre-mixed fuel for small two-stroke engines, like leafblowers and chainsaws: go to Auto Zone and buy a few gallons of fuel. Auto Zone and friends won't be going anywhere - EVs still need wiper blades, brake pads, and other incidentals. reply",

They may have more battery charging stations or replacement batteries (especially for stations on an interstate) but otherwise I think it will just be a nicer version of what we have today. Maybe higher quality hot food and more interesting snacks, which I think we are already seeing today with new stations. Most gas stations today only have one employee at a time so it seems hard to cut that down (and not much incentive tbh). Electric cars today are still under 10%. Cars last a really long time, so even if there is a huge surge in electric self-driving cars by 2030 there will still be lots of ICE cars on the road in 15 years. reply",

The small gas stations, especially ones that are local chains, or even 'mom-and-pop' businesses will probably be much slower to adapt as they won't be able to offer as much for the people waiting for a recharge to do. I think fast casual restaurants, or even small strip malls which have a fast casual restaurant as a food anchor could also benefit from this -- offer more charging spots, maybe a small discount or coupon for the charging costs if you dine at the restaurant. The large fast casual chains could probably negotiate better contracts with companies that would build and administer the infrastructure than singular restaurants could, and it would help bring some additional business in at a time when people are dining out less and less. reply",

A very cheap one, and using it is as easy as plugging into a standard outlet. I drive electric and on most days I use a little less than half the battery charge. When I return home a standard outlet can get it back to full by the next morning; the only time I ever stop at a public charger is when I'm on a long trip, and those are few and far between. I appreciate that not everybody will have the opportunity to charge their car at their own house, but a significant percentage will, and they're motivated to since it's by far the cheapest way to drive.

Essentially, they need to demonstrate that their use case fits with what LLMs are good at (ie. for in-distribution, tedious, verifiable tasks). Annecdotally, what we've found was that those using AI assistants show superficial improvements in productivity early, but they learn at a much slower rate and their understanding of the systems is fuzzy. It leads to lots of problems down the road. Senior folks are also susceptible to these effects, but at a lower level. We think it's because most of their experiences are old fashioned \"natty\" coding. In a way, I think programmers need to do natty coding to train their brains before augmenting/amputating it with AI. reply",

For example, I was doing some UI stuff the other day and in the past it would have taken a while just to get a basic page layout together when you're writing it yourself, but with a coding assistant I generated a basic page asking it to use an image mock up, a component library and some other pages as references.

          "text": "(I worked at a different processing company, which I am not speaking for.) We're struggling to find the motive or intended outcome by the attacker(s). The highest likelihood for me is that they're doing card/credential testing. They have either stolen or purchased a large number of stolen credentials. Those credentials are worth more individually if they are known to function. They can use any business on the Internet which sells anything and would tell someone \"Sorry, can't sell you that because I couldn't charge your account/card/etc. Do you have another one?\" to quickly winnow their set of credentials into a pile of ones which haven't been canceled yet and another pile. Another variation of this attack is their list is \"literally just enumerate all the cards possible in a range and try to sift down to the cards that actually exist.\" After sifting through to find the more valuable cards, they sell this onto another attacker at higher price of the mixed-working-and-not-working cards, or they pass it to their colleague who will attempt to hit the cards/creds for actual money. Digital items are useful because people selling them have high margins and have lower defenses against fraud as a result. Cheap things, especially cheap things where they can pick their price, are useful because it is less likely to trigger the attention of the card holder or their bank. (This is one reason charities get abused very frequently, because they will often happily accept a $1 or lower donation, even one which is worth less than their lowest possible payment processing cost.) The bad guys don't want to be noticed because the real theft is in the future, by them or (more likely) by someone they sell this newly-more-valuable card information onto. This hit the company I used to run back in the day, also on Paypal, and was quite frustrating. I solved it by adding a few heuristics to catch and giving a user matching those heuristics the product for free, with the usual message they got in case of a successful sale. This quickly spoils your website for the purpose they're trying to use it for, and the professional engineering team employed to abuse you experiences thirty seconds of confusion and regret before moving to the next site on their list. Back in the day, the bad guys were extremely bad at causing their browser instance to even try to look like a normal user in terms of e.g. pattern of data access prior to attempting to buy a thing. Hope some of that is useful. Best of luck and skill. You can eventually pierce through to Paypal's attention here and they may have options available contingent on you being under card/credential testing attack, or they might not. I was not successful in doing so back in the day prior to solving the problem for myself. Would also recommend building monitoring so you know this is happening in the future before the disputes roll in. Note that those disputes might be from them or from the legitimate users depending on exactly what credentials they have stolen, and in the case they are from legitimate users, you may not have caught all of the fraudulent charges yet. (Mentioning because you said \"all of the charges\" were disputed.) If I were you I'd try to cast a wider net and pre-emptively refund or review things in the wider net, both because the right thing to do and also because you may be able to head off more disputes later as e.g. people get their monthly statements. reply",

          "text": "This is a money laundering scheme where they are trying out how far they can go per domain. It's also a bug in the paypal API that they're abusing, where the SDK doesn't differ between example.com and www.example.com. If webshops like yours get exploited and used for money laundering, they will mix transactions from those two subdomains, while leaving the www.example.com domain as it is. The support people at paypal are dumb enough to not take care about each case, and usually they mix transactions later also via other social media services that have microtransactions (e.g. tiktok or snapchat streams where you can gift away items). The way paypal support's workflow works is that they have to nanually identify each and every transaction separately, meaning a human will be busy for weeks on end. Not kidding you. That's how the scammers keep winning with schemes like this. Usually there's also no way to escalate this, not even for business customers, at paypal, due to how their support offices are structured organizationally. As a mitigation I'd recommend to block ASNs that are known hosters that do this, and double check your webshop version for known vulnerabilities and fixes. If you don't use docker already, start to virtualize your webshop software now. I can't stress how important this is. Also double check any users and passwords you are using for the services, and the rest of the filesystem for indicators on the VPS. Disable SSH passwords and use only SSH key authentication on the VPS in case this hasn't been done already. I'm writing this because usually this kind of scheme starts to happen after the server got pwned already, and after e.g. the ssh password bruteforce scanner was successful or after the web exploit / persistence exploit was successful. If you need a starting point to block those botnet affiliated networks, I started both a firewall and scam database project that does exactly this: [1] https://github.com/cookiengineer/antispam [2] https://github.com/tholian-network/firewall reply",

It's very easy to misconfigure it: - The Docker daemon runs as root: any user in the docker group effectively also has sudo (--privileged) - Ports exposed by Docker punch through the firewall - In general, you can break the security boundary towards root (not your user!) by mounting the wrong things, setting the wrong flags etc. What Docker primarily gives you is a stupid (good!) solution for having a reproducible, re-settable environment.\nBut containers (read: magic isolated box) are not really a good tool to reason about security in Linux imo. If you are a beginner, instead make sure you don't run services as the sudo-capable/root user as a first step.\nThen, I would recommend you look into Systemd services: you can configure all the Linux sandboxing features Docker uses and more.\nThis composes well with Podman, which gives you a reproducible environment (drop-in replacement for Docker) but contained to an unprivileged user. reply",

          "text": "> Docker is for organizing things for yourself, just like directories are. Services have the following dependencies: static data files; configuration files; executable code/binaries; library dependencies. In days of yonder, you'd need to download/install all of that ^ on each machine where \"service A\" needs to run. Developers would run and test \"service A\" on ubuntu 18.04. But production servers had to run ubuntu 16.04 because \"service X\" that also runs on the same server needs a library that has not been ported to 18.04 yet. But \"service A\" needs a library that was never available on 16.04. Welcome to dependency hell! Containers bundle all of those dependencies into one object that can be downloaded directly onto the host server, ready for the \"service A\" process to execute. Now it doesn't matter if production servers are running 16.04. Everything \"service A\" needs is stored inside the container blob (including some minimal ubuntu 18.04 stuff). the magic that lets this happen -- containers re-use the host server's OS kernel. Running a new ubuntu 18.04 container does not start a new OS kernel running. the process for your container is just 'firewalled' off from all other processes using cgroups [0]. containers re-use the host's kernel, start a cgroup'd process which starts your container's services and processes (the 18.04 'OS' services and your binary/code/executable). short/simpler version: containers share the core of the underlying operating system on the host server. > If you want actual isolation you have to take extra steps. unfortunately, this means containers share the core of the underlying operating system on the host server. containers not being isolated from the host server OS can present a security risk as you can escape from the container and \"do bad things to host server\". [1] In cases where that is a problem you mostly have two choices: * use VMs instead (a completely isolated OS instance is started for each service, cannot interact with the host OS at all -- this uses a lot more memory/cpu) * use rootless containers [2] (container processes are launched under a specific user namespace rather than kernel namespace -- escaping the container means you only get access to the user namespace) [0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups [1]: by default the docker daemon service and all the container processes it starts are running as root, which means escaping out of a container in a a default docker installation is as bad as giving someone root.

Each application service (or a logical group of application services) is packaged directly into an immutable VM image, and the orchestration manages these VMs directly. No separate container runtime or container orchestration layer on top of the VM. So you have an Immutable, Bootable System Image, but you would use kvm plus .iso plus orchestration tech. Basically, why does nobody built a cloud on the cloud lol??

          "text": "Im not op and I’m not sure they are using it for money laundering. A money launderer can use a marketplace by creating a seller account and buying from himself. Since he’s the one buying he doesn’t need to deliver anything but he gets the money from a legit source. Usually he would use a payment method as close to money as possible so that it leaves less traces. But in OPs case, the amounts are low so he needs too many transactions to get something valuable. And because of the disputes, he’s (probably) not getting the money (?). It could be card testing: the fraudster has a bunch of cards and doesn’t know which is valid or canceled. The best way to find out is to test in a real site. So he’ll test out each of them and the ones that go through are good to use elsewhere. The thing is that it would be better for him not to dispute the transactions so the OP would take much longer to find out about the scheme and shut it down. It’s better to use low amount transactions in this case so it doesn’t use too much of the credit available for him to defraud and probably doesn’t warn the card owner. Another option is doing it just to hurt the OP marketplace. If you have too many disputes the brands can fine you and if you don’t solve the problem they can turn your account off. I’ve seen it happen when a competitor was trying to hurt the e-commerce. It’s a low move and rare but it happens. One thing that might help is to analyze the sellers too. In a money laundering and even in the other settings, it could be part of the scheme. Are they new accounts? Are their volume exploding out of nowhere? Etc reply",

          "text": "It's pretty easy to figure out max capacity of any of those businesses. Audit the traffic and compare against reported figures. So yeah, you can get away with it, but can't go overboard. It's safer to just waste some high margin inventory to keep. A bar I used to go to was a ML operation and they would just ring in lots of expensive drinks throughout the night and then the boss would come in and settle up the registers. No matter how much I drank my tab was always $20. The same was true for pretty much anyone that was a regular. It was great because it was definitely impressive to order a round of patrons shots for everyone at the bar. On a busy night there would be a couple instances where the DJ would bring up one of \"the guys\" and let him announce that the DJ was gonna play his 3 favorite songs and while they were playing everybody in the bars drinks would be on him.  Very fun. reply",

          "text": "+1. As mentioned on the side, this will negatively impact your conversion rate. But you don't need to leave it on forever, either; you can use it to get some breathing room. The attacker may lose interest or move on to more fruitful targets if they find themselves blocked even temporarily. This is the \"don't need to be faster than the bear\" dynamic of online fraud: there are infinite targets and you don't need to perfectly shut out an attacker to make the ROI unappealing for them. My thoughts on the scenario: 1. Chargebacks are not just a financial problem. There is no amount of money you can pay to regain the trust of your sellers (as it's a marketplace) or to change terms with your payment providers. 2. If the emails come from the same domain, can you block the domain? There are lots of throwaway domains, but it's effort for the attacker to switch them, too. 3. CAPTCHAs are increasingly ineffective between captcha solving services and multi-modal AI. I've heard in a few recent attacks that hCaptcha does a little better than Turnstile or reCAPTCHA. 4. Shadowbanning is good for wasting your attacker's time, which is really important to kill their ROI. You'll need to get your false positive rate low though to not piss off your actual good customers. 5. Your scenario (no API, browser required, no bot activity expected) is a really good fit for properly implemented device fingerprinting. I'm the PM for Fraud & Security at Stytch and we do have a Device Fingerprinting product. It's harder to trial than the open-source ones, but the advantage is that attackers can't inspect the implementation to evade it. Would you be interested in talking more? I'm happy to walk through your current controls and see if it makes sense to test Device Fingerprinting, shoot me an email at (first letter of my username) + (last four letters of my username) @ stytch.com . reply",

Be willing to temporarily suspend your services in order to prevent the malicious behavior. Do the manual work to allow genuine customers to keep using your service, e.g: require manual account approval. You need to treat every one of these chargeback transactions as a risk to your businesses ability to operate, each that you allow to happen increases the risk of permanent damage to your business. Reach out to your account manager at PayPal, this is not something that should be going via frontline support. You need to be talking to a person who knows and is responsible for your account. If you don’t have one, get one. If you can’t get one, look for anti payment fraud businesses that work with PayPal, they may be able to get a direct line to PayPal on your behalf. For the future, if you’re dependent upon a service provider you should always have someone you can reach out to directly. If a provider isn’t willing to offer that, find a different provider. Financial services especially are very risk averse and will jettison your account if they get even a whiff of something untoward, whether you tried to prevent it or not. The cost of recovering from that will dwarf the cost of any drastic mitigation you take now. Losing your PayPal account is worse than turning off purchases for a few days. reply",

Their support sucks and is completely unhelpful, managing your account was at the time extremely complex, compared any other payment solution. Our rule taking PayPal: Transfer EVERYTHING out of your PayPal account on a daily basis, do not let them hold your funds, they will block you from accessing it at some point. Minimize what they can touch. Also don't all smaller amounts to be paid with PayPal. This prevents you from being abused as a source for verifying stolen accounts. The only company I dealt with that came close to the same level of incompetency was Klarna. Klarna didn't at the time understand the concept of fraud, because they're Swedish and their system in Sweden MOSTLY prevented fraud at the time. Once people found away around that and Klarna expanded beyond Sweden, they gave up and attempted to stick the bill on us, despite their contracts clearly stated that they where responsible for collecting payments. reply",

It has like four apps and two uses cases, one of which is \"luxury paperweight\". They're still trying to find the other one. To buy (and keep) one, you have to be rich enough that a couple months' rent is nothing, self-confident (or socially oblivious) enough that you don't mind looking like a Star Wars droid knock-off, and masochistic enough to want to take your neck to the gym every time you want to watch a movie. Not a very big target audience... It's too heavy and limited to be a useful personal screen. It's useless for gaming. It's too expensive to be an occasional-use-only device. It's a solution to a problem nobody had, and it solves none of the problems people do have. Sure, it had a lot of fancy tech, and maybe made sense as a laboratory prototype, but not a consumer device. You can do more with the $300 Facebook goggles for 10% of the price, or get one of the pricier but slimmer AR glasses (Xreal, etc.) reply",

I think that anything that is going to require humans to wear something on their head for entertainment purposes is not going to make it to mainstream. There will be niche uses and likely video games are a good niche. What is going to compel people to buy something like the Vision Pro when they already have smart phones that can do everything anyways? Also, humans over 40 tend to start needing reading glasses and with each year of age more and more people need them.

The headline will not be about doing a-previously-undoable-x. Vision Pro does not facilitate teamwork and teamwork is how approximately all important things get done. Not solipsistically.  I mean visualize a conversation through Vision Pro versus one using Facetime or zoom. You lose most non-verbal communication if you leave the goggles on.

I work with a company who builds interactive educational experiences in VR and even they can't use it because it can't do basic things like accurately keep track of hand positioning or gestures (beyond pitch). Really the only use case for it is as a media device, but the price is way too high to buy it for that alone. If the hope was that businesses and developers were going to buy one and start developing an ecosystem around it then they probably should have made it more than a glorified 3D TV, or made it much cheaper so it was more widely accessible. I hear there's rumours they're going to add handsets soon though, so if they can do that while also bringing the price down a little that might help adoption a bit. reply",

          "text": "Your question is \"Is there any demand for Personal CV/Resume website?\". The short answer is: There is demand for employment . What problem are you actually trying to solve? If you were looking for a job, would writing a résumé be the biggest hurdle for you? People write CVs to apply for jobs, and they apply for jobs to work, and they work to have an income which they use to go on about life. Now, what we have here is selling soap to hungry people who are broke. A CV builder is like soap in a restaurant; it is important to wash your hands at a restaurant, but you don't go to a restaurant to wash your hands. It can be a hook to do other things, like discover your customers, etc. but your would be users eventually come to you to get a job. How do you get them there? What are the sides of this market? You have a distribution problem. Ideally, anyone who uses your CV builder gets employed. Which means they get hired. Which means there's an employer on the other side who received that CV. How do you plug in that process? Maybe go upstream and do some fine targeting, maybe a choice of the point of market entry: start with people who are looking for their first job and who've never had a CV. You shouldn't wait for them to find you; they may not even be aware they need a CV. Maybe you can start with employment agencies where you live. Many countries have agencies where unemployed people register to get notified when a job matching their skills is available. Maybe going to high-schools or colleges and getting your users there, on the spot, helping them making a CV. Maybe fine-tune where you plug in that value chain: the builder is just to get the data in order to make recommendations to jobs that match their skills that they weren't even aware existed. Get to know who you're serving and what serving them is about. This response is about the feasibility of this, not about its viability as a business or if it is worth your while. reply",

Their applicant tracking systems expect a file to be uploaded, pasted, or entered manually so that they can run it through a scanner to match keywords or whatever. As an interviewer, I get the resume attached to calendar invites, so it needs to be uploaded for that to work. So go talk to the users and ask them what they need to make their jobs easier. For applicants, maybe they need a way to submit a basic resume, and then for each job, they can paste a link to the job description, and you can have generative AI revise the resume to match the job being applied for, and then they can download the PDF and use it to apply to that job. reply",

Here's the link to the text of H.R. 1 on GovTrack: https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr1/text We automatically add links to U.S. Code and other citations. In this case Congress.gov is missing rich formatting which we have (I'm not sure why they are missing it for this bill, normally they have it). GovTrack also allows making diff-like comparisons between bill versions and between bills (for example, you can see the last-minute changes made ahead of the vote on this bill). Source code is available on GitHub if anyone wants to try making GovTrack better, although it's quite complicated because Congressional information is complicated and there's no real money behind this: https://github.com/govtrack/govtrack.us-web/ If anyone has particular thoughts on what would be helpful when viewing bill text --- within the realm of the information that is actually freely available --- I am all ears. reply",

In the last 15 years, efforts to make Congress publish more and better-structured information have been relatively bipartisan and, mostly, led by nonpolitical staff.

          "text": "Honestly I don't think it would be that costly, but it would take a pretty long time to put together. I have a (few years old) copy of Library Genesis converted to plaintext and it's around 1TB. I think libgen proper was 50-100TB at the time, so we can probably assume that AA (~1PB) would be around 10-20TB when converted to plaintext. You'd probably spend several weeks torrenting a chunk of the archive, converting everything in it to plaintext, deleting the originals, then repeating with a new chunk until you have plaintext versions of everything in the archive. Then indexing all that for full text search would take even more storage and even more time, but still perfectly doable on commodity hardware. The main barriers are going to be reliably extracting plaintext from the myriad of formats in the archive, cleaning up the data, and selecting a decent full text search database (god help you if you pick wrong and decide you want to switch and re-index everything later). reply",

          "text": "1. It'd be for the scientific community (broadly-construed). Converting media that is currently completely un-indexed into plaintext and offering a suite of search features for finding content within it would be a game-changer, IMO! If you've ever done a lit review for any field other than ML, I'm guessing you know how reliant many fields are on relatively-old books and articles (read: PDFs at best, paper-only at worst) that you can basically only encounter via a) citation chains, b) following an author, or c) encyclopedias/textbooks. 2. I really don't see how this could ever lead to any kind of legal issue. You're not hosting any of the content itself, just offering a search feature for it. GoodReads doesn't need legal permission to index popular books, for example. In general I get the sense that your comment is written from the perspective of an entrepreneur/startup mindset. I'm sure that's brought you meaning and maybe even some wealth, but it's not a universal one! Some of us are more interested in making something to advance humanity than something likely to make a profit, even if we might look silly in the process. reply",

You don't need to host copyrighted material. It's all about intent . The Pirate Bay is (imo correctly, even if I disagree with other aspects about copyright law and its enforcement) seen as a place where people go to find ways to not pay authors for their content. They never hosted a copyrighted byte but they're banned in some form (DNS, IP, domain seizures) in many countries. Proxies of TPB also, so being like an ISP for such a site is already enough, whereas nobody is ordering blocks of Comcast's IP addresses for providing access to websites with copyrighted material because they didn't have a somewhat-provable intent to provide copyright infringement When I read the OP, I imagine this would link from the search results directly to Anna's archive and sci-hub, but I think you'd have to spin it as a general purpose search page and ideally not even mention AA was one of the sources, much less have links (Don't get me wrong: everyone wants this except the lobby of journals that presently own the rights) It would be a real shame if an anonymous third party that's definitely not the website operator made a Firefox add-on that illegitimately inserts these links to search results page though reply",

Yet when giant corporations are doing the exact same thing on a massive scale, it's fine? It's not even the same thing, an American student torrenting books isn't making any money off it, while Meta very much is. Of course it's not the same, a simple-minded and poorly educated person like me isn't capable of understanding the difference.

Honestly was too tired to point that out in my earlier reply, but that's exactly the kind of argument you get when people are not willing (or purposefully refusing) to consider details. Intentionally or not, you get bogus and highly manipulative statements. A single case of a student activist fighting for freedom of communication and access to public goods for citizens, ending up breaking under pressure from public/non-profit institutions MIT, JSTOR, FBI over copyright, is not the same as what GP implied - many students, regular folks just like you and me, being forced to take their own lives due to legal consequences of pirating books in bulk. Nothing like the latter ever happened anyway. We can do better than this. (And even if we can't, I trust the courts can.) -- [0] - Curiously, while doing some search now to be sure I didn't miss any similar case, I learned that JSTOR incident wasn't the first for 'aaronsw - apparently, he did the same thing a few years earlier with public court documents[1]; FBI investigated this too, and concluded he was legally in the clear. It's probably well-known to everyone here, but I somehow missed it, so #TodayILearned.

They used their infinite VC money supply to interfere with and delay investigations and enforcement, betting that if they do it fast enough, they'll have the general population on their side. LLM vendors found and exploited[0] a legal uncertainty - correct me if I'm wrong, but AFAIK it still isn't settled whether or not their actions were actually illegal. Unlike Uber, LLM vendors aren't breaking into markets by ignoring the laws to outcompete incumbents, and burning stupid amounts of money just to get away with it. On the contrary, LLM vendors are simply providing an actually useful product, and charging a reasonable price for it, while reinvesting it into improving the product. Effects it has on other markets aside[1], their business model is just providing actual value in exchange for money. That's much more direct and honest than most of the tech industry . The product itself is also different. Uber is selling a mirage, a \"miracle\" improvement that quickly turns not so, and is destined to eventually destroy the markets it disrupted. LLM vendors are developing and serving systems that provide actual value to users, directly and obviously so. -- [0] - Probably walked into this without initially realizing it. No one complained 5-10 years ago, where the datasets were smaller and the resulting models had no real-world utility. It's only when the models became useful, that some people started looking for ways to make them go away.

The dashboard tool also provides remote terminal and file system access. Everything displays in a web browser. I run PiHole for DNS in my stack. I have toyed with the idea of writing my own PiHole alternative but taken no such action yet. I also run PhotoPrism, Jellyfin, Meali, and some other stuff. reply",

You can also explore having OpenTelemetry collectors in the middle for more sophisticated processing and if you want to keep an eye on its ecosystem.

Documentation isn't all there and some of the debian packages aren't stellar (so you may want to build your own, which is ezpz) but IME it's a reliable stack. They do integrate with Grafana much like Prometheus but we are not happy with Grafana[0] and recommendations for something low-maintenance we can drop in to the above stack instead would be awesome. [0]: Why? Managing dashboards/plugins in an airgapped IaC setting is like pulling teeth at every other turn. Then at one point supposedly we had the container version pinned (by tag not sha, lesson learned) but yet at some point an image update from Docker Hub broke most of our dashboard/data-source links so now those dashboards are broken and I'd rather try something new before I recommit to Grafana. reply",

We build drones (software and hardware) We're looking for engineers that straddle real world problems, and use technology as a solution. We prefer personal projects or relevant hobbies, not hard leetcode questions. We value collaboration: pair programming, discussing, teaching and learning from others. We're looking for mission-driven engineers. People who see problems in the world and want to help solve them. You'd be working with me to build the most intuitive, performant, and modern mission planning and flight monitoring software for drones, and related applications (tools for drone design and manufacturing). For my project, we use React, Tailwind, Node, drizzle-orm, Postgres, SQLite, deck.gl, Python, FastAPI, asyncio, and more. You're allowed (and compensated) to use AI services. Because we are a small team, you will be noticed and rewarded for performance. *Please don’t apply if any of these resonate:* • You prefer narrow ownership—“I only touch the backend or the code I've written”. • You think it's more about \"who you know, not what you know\". • You haven’t actively learned a new tool or hobby in the last year.

          "text": "New Hedge fund | Sr/Staff Frontend Engineer | On-site (NYC) We are a new discretionary, tech industry focused hedge fund, founded by a portfolio manager with 15+ years of experience at a Tiger Cub. I lead the data/technology team here and previously spent ~6 years in a similar role at a well known Tiger Cub. We are hiring for a frontend senior/staff engineer for our internal research management web application. Our tech stack: * Frontend: Typescript, Vue3 * Backend: Cloudflare, Supabase/Postgresql, Typescript * Obviously, we are not the only ones trying to figure out how to use AI in investing but in a world where there are lots of people trying to build picks & shovels, this is an opportunity to be one of the goldminers at a greenfield, new firm. This role makes sense for people who are interested in finance/investing (although you do not necessarily have to have experience in the industry). We're in full-time in office in NYC, so that's a requirement for FTE. We are potentially open to exceptional contractors located remotely. We work very hard, hours are long, and people are very dedicated to the mission. It is not for everyone, but for those interested in competing in financial markets, love startup atmosphere without near-term existential risk, and want to work with super smart colleagues (both technical and investors!), this could be a great fit. Target salary 180-250K, depending on experience + Bonus/Carry (hedge fund equity equivalent) Contact: ai@nx1.com , I'm Alex. reply",

We are fixing this for pediatrics. Blueberry is the most affordable option amongst our competitors. We practice the highest quality pediatric telemedicine, as evidenced by our exclusive hiring of board-certified pediatricians and the usage of at-home medical kits. And, we’re accessible 24 hours a day. Our success is shown in the lives we save, the costs we save our insurers, and our exploding B2B and D2C business. As you can imagine, pulling off affordable high-quality healthcare is a challenge. It requires a lot of engineering ingenuity, a C-suite aligned with positive patient outcomes above short-term profits, and a great product team. We use Django, Hotwire Turbo (an HTMX-like framework), Pytorch, Sklearn, and Flutter. Experience in these technologies helps, but what’s more important is general full-stack knowledge, curiosity, and a strong work ethic.

We have two of the largest self hosted ClickHouse clusters out there (and growing rapidly) each with Petabytes of data. We are working on really interesting solutions to problems that we would love to open source for the broader CH ecosystem: - Declarative, cluster aware migrations - Iceberg and S3 backed merge tree's on ClickHouse (as performant as local MergeTrees) - ClickHouse on K8s, but on Metal instances w/ NVMe used for caching and compaction. - Load shedding query scheduler and eventually query optimizer We have a broad charter when it comes to ClickHouse. It's one of the things that enables us to build so many products that share the same underlying data and context. Our goal is to enable all developers at PostHog to continue building these products quickly as the team and user-base scales. It's honestly an exciting time to be working at this company and on the beating heart of what drives it. Chat with me if you have any questions! reply",

That’s because our commercial focus is on our fully-managed cloud platform, so in addition to folks implementing the core database (C, Rust), we’re also heavily hiring for folks with operational cloud & database experience at scale (Kubernetes with custom k8s operators, Golang, etc), as well as folks interested in providing highly technical support, database release engineering, and building database testing infrastructure (think performance analysis, distributed database correctness testing, etc.) And product folks to support these efforts & all our users! Lots of fun engineering and product work with an amazing company culture.

We're a small team automating the painful admin work that clogs up the U.S. healthcare system — things like prior authorizations, discharge planning, and insurance claims.

We're hiring senior engineers across the stack: backend, frontend, and AI/LLM. We're NYC-based and hybrid (most of us come in ~3 days/week). We're not counting badge swipes — we just want teammates who want to be in the room with us often enough to build trust, have fun, and work on hard problems together! What we're building: * A general-purpose automation platform for healthcare ops, powered by LLMs * A system that reads unstructured documents, fills out payer forms, and explains rejections * Tools to automate patient discharge planning in hospitals * A foundation for making AI in healthcare safe, observable, and human-in-the-loop What we're looking for: * AI Engineer — experience productionizing LLM apps (agents, RAG, embeddings); solid Python; knows how to build ML systems that ship * Backend Engineer — strong Python/FastAPI; infra-savvy (K8s, Terraform, Docker); thoughtful about API design and scalability * Frontend Engineer — React/TypeScript expert who's opinionated about UX and happy to dip into backend when needed More importantly, we're looking for engineers who like open-ended, ambiguous challenges, and want to work with a tight-knit, high-trust team to solve real-world problems.

We're not just a credit card—we’re creating an extensible platform where powerful mini-apps help users control, understand, and automate their finances. From budgeting tools that prevent overspending to AI-driven insights that surface patterns in your spending, Klutch lets users shape how their credit card works for them. Our core belief: financial products should be programmable, transparent, and intelligent. We're looking for builders to help shape this vision: Fullstack Developer – Kotlin + React. You'll ship end-to-end features, build new mini-apps, and contribute to the internal platform that powers them. Product Designer – Help define a UX model for composable finance—where users can mix and match tools that feel tailored to them. Product Manager – Own a domain like AI Insights or Budget Controls. You'll define the roadmap, talk to users, and launch products quickly. We use Kotlin (Exposed, Ktor), React + Next.js, AWS (Fargate, Lambda), MySQL, and Mongo. Our stack also supports integrating AI models directly into mini-apps. If you’re passionate about redefining how people interact with money—and want to help build a platform others can build on too—we’d love to talk.

          "text": "Do this course https://github.com/henki-robotics/robotics_essentials_ros2 Totally free, don't need to buy anything just a computer. I've been designing electrical hardware for robots for the last 4 years for a big corporation and I can tell you, the fun and money is in the software but having another skill is awesome. Robotics is a place where multiple fields converge and if you find a good team they will help you to grow. Embedded is the adjacent field after you complete the course. Maybe something like zephyr project. If you want to get you feet wet with mechanical. Buy a A1 mini and play with onshape (www.onshape.com) to design your first pieces, supports for the motors or the board, try create you own gripper. As for the electrical engineering, is the one with most pitfalls and the most expensive. A wrong voltage will release the magical smoke and is another 30$ for a board. Tread carefully. Start with the RP2040 or the RP2350, they are cheap and well documented. This skill will evolve hand by hand with the embedded coding. Start small. Learn about H-bridge and brushed motors before doing the jump to the bigboys and FOC control with brushless. Get a cheap soldering iron. If you can, a clone of the JBC C245 tips. Is the most versatile and you can find stuff in alie xpress for 45 or 50$ and would be similar to the tools you will find in the field without breaking the bank. Search for ROS meetups. I could point you to some depending where in the world you are. And above all, it will be a long journey. Don't dispear, do at your own time but don't forget the objective. reply",

          "text": "I'm in the field and I disagree with the initial direction of this post. You aren't going to 'learn robotics' in a meaningful manner by checking the boxes in a online ROS2 course. Robotics is a compound discipline which pairs mechanical and electrical engineering knowledge with mathematics and software development. In order to get meaningful practice in all of these areas, I would recommend re-implementing a robot vacuum from 'scratch'. The actual vacuum part is non-essential, as you're really trying to implement the famous 'turtle' robot and experience all the design steps/compromises/challenges first hand. As a goal, aim for autonomous navigation around your home that works equivalently to a cheap 'throwaway' robo-vac. Keep in mind you are surrounded by robotics. Most passenger vehicles, consumer drones, micro-mobility devices and modern construction equipment are 'robots in varying degrees of disguise'. Practical knowledge regarding any of these systems transfers well if you know where to apply it. reply",

          "text": "Microcontrollers and PLC are historically different fields that have some overlap as the fields converge somewhat. PLC come from relay logic and so learning Ladder Logic and playing with a cheaper Automation Direct PLC might be good if you're looking to do control systems like industrial machines and those robotics. RPi series micros are good to learn embedded electronics, servo controls and Realtime OS. Computer Engineering and Control System Engineering are treated differently even in the California State Engineering License Exams, so they tend to be different paths but the skills have some overlap. My degree was in computer engineering and didn't cover any PLC, but I contract and PLC comes up a lot in one-off things that need to be reliable. reply",

          "text": "Yeah. As some has said already PLC are more oriented to robotic arms in factories etc, where space is not a premium.  Robots like anymal from anybotics, spot from boston dynamics or the unidog from unitree to name a few don't use PLC at all due to lack of space. Also energy efficiency, mcu at most will push less than a watt to move something complex, a motor control for the FOC, I mentioned earlier. I worked for the past 4 years in HP siteprint.The main problem was developing all to fit inside a pelican case that you could check in on a plane. The smallest PLC was almost the full internal volume of the robot. That's why I said microcontrollers, more ready available to experiment at home, faaaaaaaar more cheaper and those two, very well documented. STM32 in europe is the big player but is harder to get into, the documentation tends to be cahotic. reply",

          "text": "This is by far one of the best ways to learn IMO https://store.steampowered.com/app/573090/Stormworks_Build_a... The idea of that game is that you build vehicles to do rescues and deal with natural disasters. While there is a career mode where you gain currency that you can spend on parts and fuel, most people who play that game play it in sandbox mode where you essentially design vehicles to do certain things, while also configuring the game to chose missions it generates. For example, you can make it so you only have to deal with land rescue missions or only fight enemy ai. The building system is VERY in depth.  While you don't have to worry about structural strength, you do have to keep things in mind like part placement, CG location, internal volume for buoyancy for ships. Then you get to propulsion, which you have to build out of components - the game has a fairly indepth internal combustion engine simulator where you build custom engines, and have to make sure they are fed with adequate fuel, air, and cooled appropriately. You can do jet engines, you can do nuclear, you can do full electric, and so on. Then you have to build systems to do missions - for example, to transport a container you have to build a crane to be able to pick it up. Finally, the game features a microcontroller system which is the bread and butter of doing cool things. There is a bunch of sensors that can read data (GPS, laser distance, pitch, roll, heading, radar, e.t.c), which you can route into a microcontroller, and do math either with logic blocks or Lua code, and thats how you build automation. You will get very familiar with things like PID controller tuning, trigonometry math (for things like distance sensing), state machine coding practices, and other things that are all applicable to the real world. reply",

The robots are controlled by drivers, but can also act autonomously for more points. The task is different each year, with sub-tasks of varying levels of difficulty, so teams with widely different skill levels can take part: some robots are very simple while others are amazingly complicated. It's a great way for high schoolers to learn engineering skills, anything from programming to mechanical engineering.) reply",

          "text": "I couldn't agree more. FIRST is an excellent organization to get involved with. Even if you don't have specialities which directly align with the needs of a team, most will not turn you away (especially if you demonstrate passion). Just a few thoughts about starting a team and/or volunteering: Starting a FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team is not for the feint-of-heart and requires significant time and money investment. This is the sort of endeavor you try when you're either retired or have a group of other dedicated volunteers willing to help you build the team over multiple seasons. If you spend a year or two mentoring/volunteering for a well-established team, you'll get a good sense of what you're getting into. FRC is a bit hardcore. If no FRC teams exist nearby, FIRST Lego League (FLL) is a good entrypoint, but may not be technical enough for an adult interested in using FIRST to gain exposure to robotics. (It is plenty satisfying to mentor these teams, but Mindstorms can be somewhat limiting.) These are geared toward using Lego Mindstorms for learning robot concepts. A good middle ground (for exposure to more practical robotics) would be volunteering with a FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) team. It's the middle ground between FLL and FRC and is _doable_ for a single, dedicated, passionate adult to start (though I'd strongly recommend finding another volunteer to pursue this with). If getting involved with a team is not an option, seek out nearby FIRST events that you can volunteer at. Many competition events need volunteers and you'll get a chance to interact with local teams and find plenty of opportunities to play with robots. reply",

          "text": "Two bits of advice: just jump in, and set reasonable expectations for yourself. Robotics is a field filled with layers upon layers of complexity, theory, and real-world problems. Those at the top of the game (think robust dog robots, walking bipedal star wars droids, high-speed and high-torque many-DOF arm platforms) are leveraging learnings and expensive prototypes from decades of work/research to achieve those feats. This is not to be discouraging, but to say - they all started somewhere - you too can start, and maybe you won't build things like that today, but you can get there. And the cool thing is all that robotics work by experts has made the barrier to entry much lower - today you can choose to apply money to solve problems you don't want to learn and focus on the things you do want to learn, in ways that weren't possible 10 years ago. Need a powerful closed loop motor system? Buy an ODrive or closed-loop stepper platform off the shelf, and focus on how to apply those systems to build something higher level. But the big difference with learning hardware/robotics compared to software (speaking from experience having watched a lot of really smart people struggle to get robots working when I ran an MIT robotics competition, 6.270, and was a lab assistant for another course, 6.141) is that the real world is unforgiving in a way that software is generally not. So if you come from a software background, you will find that robotics can have so many more setbacks because nothing ever moves/behaves/reacts in a precisely predictable way in physical space. This is why I say just jump in - you'll have fun learning all the ways things go wrong, and they faster you get that learning out of the way, the sooner you can build things that work reliably! Try things and figure out how and why they don't work, and iterate. But don't set unrealistically high expectations or it will just be frustrating. reply",

          "text": "From the electronics side, the path towards control theory is a lot of math (signals and systems, Fourier transforms, transfer functions, feedback and oscillations, compensation circuits) ultimately leading up to the student solving the inverted pendulum problem sometimes in early Masters degree region or maybe the advanced student Bachelor's degree. I'm not entirely sure how to make that more 'accessible'. It's like, spend the next 5 years of your life mastering difficult math and electronics so that the sensors can be integrated into feedback that stabilizes a motor system. I guess you can cheat and use servos for a lot of this (where an EE already solved many feedback loop issues). But if you ever need to build your own sensor+motor solution you'd get stuck if you didn't know the math. ------- Making simple controls without relying upon feedback sensors is likely the goal, you can do a lot with that. But then do your best to avoid the Masters level demons that plague this problem set. Maybe learn PID controller theory and if that isn't enough for your problems, give up and try a different design. PID is simple enough that you won't need years of math to learn, but it's very adhoc to configure and not always the best methodology to use. Better than nothing though. reply",

Grad schools prepare you for the basics of the hardest possible systems. On the engineering side the number of difficult problems with robotics is enormous. Even the simplest systems will fail pretty badly outside lab. No two robots will work the same. As a grad student those are the things you learn on top of IK at work. So if you get employed for designing actual 6+ DoF systems and missing the theoretical stuff you'll be way behind. However, for self teaching and hobby stuff, just making a simple robot work reliably is still a difficult task with lots of learning potential. It may not cover complex arms but you may actually gain knowledge to solve the engineering part of the problems which is a huge boost for theories. reply",

          "text": "In all honesty I’d try and model a 2d 3-link arm in software with forward and inverse kinematics. Then I’d model the inertia of the bars, and model DC motors to apply a torque to the bar interconnects. I’d then model PID controllers for each motor to smoothly move the arm. I’d then move to 3D. Once the physics is modelled you’ll find speccing the motors, solidworks, motor drivers, and MCUs relatively straightforward if you have some basics in electronics. The fundamentals of robotics is in the math; think control theory. Don’t over emphasize the surface level like ROS, arduinos, and Lego kits. Those are implementation details reply",

          "text": "A really top-tier robotics engineer is going to be a generalist across mechanical, electrical, and several software domains, and then also a specialist, deep expert in one or two of those. So I'd recommend doing a bit of everything then picking a specialty to learn in depth. Build a really simple kit robot and then program it to do simple stuff using ROS. Write a few ROS nodes from scratch to do something simple, things that existing ROS nodes already do. Then learn why the STL ROS options are (most likely) better than yours. I strongly recommend taking the generalist approach. It makes you a much better engineer in the long run. I had a friend call me up enraged one day. He got woken up at 1am and ordered to drive across the state to get a site back up and running because his hardware was broken and the very expensive software team was sitting around wasting their time. So he got to the site at three or four AM and found that the room full of software engineers, three PhDs among them, didn't understand that BOTH of the battery terminals needed to be connected. Yes, batteries in fact have a positive and a negative. And these people were each getting paid twice as much as him. He left that company and became hardware leadership at a much better company, thank goodness. My point is, super-specializing in the most profitable hyper-niche right off the bat is going to make you a very mediocre robotics engineer who might be successful in the short term, but might find yourself unemployed in a few years when we find a better modality to replace your hyper-niche. Specialists win the sprints, generalists win the marathons. reply",

          "text": "Honestly, and I feel like a promoter… but get either a hackpack from Mark Rober or as otherwise mentioned, mindstorms from LEGO. Crunch labs: https://www.crunchlabs.com/ As someone in the industry (I literally can call myself a Robot Master having a Masters Degree in Robotics), these simple “kid kits” are phenomenal. When you first start out, the hardest part is knowing the hardware is actually going to do what you tell it to do. Simplifying the mechanical engineering/electrical engineering so you can immediately create real world actions makes a huge difference in giving you motivation to keep going. Once you have the basics in place and you understand mechanisms, sensors, and some algorithms, you can move on to other parts of robotics. However, keep in mind robotics is really about system thinking… you have to understand trades between sensing, thinking, and acting. But most importantly you have to remember you are dealing with the real world… you can’t as easily write a unit test and know that a particular actuator will behave exactly the same way every time. reply",

          "text": "There are many ways to start with a more academic knowledge of robotics. Courses, ROS, Programs etc. Just picking one is a fine start and you will learn something, but you may not have fun or appreciate the context for what you are learning, which makes it hard to care. It also depends on what you're trying to learn. Programming? control? electronics? mechanism design? There are many different aspects that require their own expertise. I personally think of a roboticist as someone that can be functional in all the disciplines and bring it all together. Some one that can build a robot from scratch. This advice is targeted towards someone starting in robotics with an emphasis on building a totally custom robot. You are doing the whole thing from scratch, no kit. (kits are super useful, but I personally like building everything and making hardware that works for me). In my eyes, if you haven't built it in hardware, it probably isn't a robot. As a research roboticist, my best advice is forget Learning it all up front and just start building. You will probably have strengths and weaknesses, but robotics is a very multi-disciplinary problem and at the start, requires some head banging in what we like to call integration hell. Just Trying to build something does a couple things. It gets you acquainted with the interaction of all aspects (mechanical, electrical, software) of a robot and how they interact. Most importantly it gives you context for sll the things you learn later on. Build something, come across a problem, and google/brute force your way to a solution. You will stumble across context relevant resources and lessons in the moment. Especially at the start, a more \"formal\" education is too broad and comprehensive for the curious roboticist. My simple advice is to just come up with something simple and SEND IT! For mechanical - Onshape for 3D design (free tier) and a bambu A1 mini 3d printer can get you building anything you want for <$400. A couple nights of CAD tutorials will get you started. Hell you can even start with cardboard and hot glue if this is cost/time prohibitive. For electronics - Browse www.adafruit.com or www.sparkfun.com for sensors and microcontroller boards. They both support QWICC connections which makes getting sensors plugged in and running super easy for a beginner. For computation and control a basic Arduino Uno or one of the adafruit feathers will do just fine. Don't get caught up in the internet debate on what the best microcontroller/single board computer is. The best robot is one that works and it is VERY easy to get in over your head in this realm and fall into the premature optimization track. Better to get something working that under performs than to never build at all. For software - Most lower level robotics uses c++, which I think scares people. It is mostly because it is one level above hardware. Arduino/common libraries take care of all the hard stuff and you don’t have to worry about large scale things like garbage collection, memory leaks, or efficient code off the bat. The websites above have libraries, examples, and tutorials for every sensor. Even a non programmer type can smush the example code together in a functional way and get something up and running. As you try to build you will learn and get more complicated. Robotics is so vast and large its best to focus on learning the skill you need at the time. But my main advice is just go build the thing and the learning resources/skills will present themselves when they are needed. Otherwise it is just too much to take a more planned approach. reply",

If you are interested in getting this One Amazing Thing working, great!  You have the motivation and cranking through what you'll need to lean to succeed will be possible. IF, on the other hand, you want to make 1e6 of these things (\"tech giants seems to capture most of the conversation\")-- that a completely different story.  You're going to need a skilled team, ideally one that has been to a rodeo before.    I can't help you there. But if you're building one, for fun --- Just DO It.  Ask friendly robotics club members when you get stuck.  IF your problem is particularly and singularly unique, then whatever domain that entails, you will need to master; that's your Secret Sauce. Ivan Sutherland, who was Thesis Advisor to CMU's first Robotics Institute PhD said something to the effect that after 4 years of a Robotics PhD program, you end up with the ability to solder and attach connectors with a high degree of confidence. A True Roboticists requires deep knowledge in mathematics, software engineering, mechanical engineering, manufacturing small lots, reliability engineering, materials engineering, data collection & graphical evaluation methodologies..... What one might call a Systems Engineer's handbag.  It also helps to be inspired by the wonders of nature that biology affords us. The details?   eh, they change.  Whether you used some hot cpu, some hot language, some hot OS --- Marc Raibert's hopping & jumping robots used C and BSD4.3 Unix, with the kernel locks cleaned up (reduced) so a 1 kHz kernel interrupt stream could be supported on a 1 MIPS machine (Vax 780).  Timesharing was never stopped, but the kernel did get quite a large percentage of CPU cycles. I'll repeat: Just do it.  Start.  Move forward.

Turns out an advanced grad-student software group had brought me in (back in 2004) because their grad students couldn't build reliable software for the real world, and their military \"research partners\" were getting rather p.o.'d. \nBut I'm a non-degreed Mechatronics Systems Engineer, in the truest sense of the word. I'm old enough to predate software engineering programs. \nI learned robotics and automation because I was curious, it fueled my ADD, and I kept at it... in the beginning I used plug-in cards for the IBM PC, but I knew basic electronics as a hobby (ham radio, telephonics, heathkit, etc.) and I devoured books. Anything I could get my hands on. Especially Byte magazine and Steve Ciarcia's Circuit Cellar columns.\nSo get copies of Forest Mims III stuff, and get an arduino or raspberry pi (you can even get/run Codesys on a pi, to learn PLC stuff) and get magazine issues/books from Make: and watch lots of youtube from ElectroBoom and AvE and get your hands dirty. \nRemember, you can be skilled at robotics without building Optimus. Currently I'm building and programming high speed mail handling equipment. Not sexy, but it pays the bills and fuels my dopamine. It's all servomotors and sensors and decision logic. And challenging too, paper's moving at 1/8\" per millisecond at mid-speeds, you need to be an efficient coder and pre-optimizing your logic, and it's all state machines, all the way down. \nGood luck.

          "text": "My answer is definitely not going to be impressive compared to some grey beards, but at my job in the early 2020s, they liked to say they had a \"servers are cattle, not pets\" mentality, but that was just the case of most of them. They had sentinel servers for each environment that held varying special meaning (only they handled certain tasks) that was poorly documented. The CEO (the one who wrote most of the initial code but now was uninvolved in the software) never wanted to touch them - he saw the entire server as a house of cards. The problem was, not updating this thing just let to piles and piles of out of date packages and eventually past EOL for the entire distro it used. I'd say it lasted six years without an update til I showed that that it _needed_ an update when they went for SOC2. It honestly wasn't that bad to replicate - some strange edge cases, but like a day of work. Their MySQL instance was about the same age, but they chose an older version than was stable at the time, so it also went EOL and they left it sitting there. Hell, I don't know if they've update it to this day. For some context, it's a small enough DB (in terms of size), that you could probably even get away with a long running SQL dump. What scares me is that I have to imagine so many companies operate this way and they handle much more sensitive data. C'est la vie, I guess. reply",

          "text": "This question brings back memories. For a previous B2B service I ran, we had a client in the manufacturing space with a very specific requirement: \"do not touch the server unless it is absolutely critical.\" It was a simple Node.js + PostgreSQL server running on a fire-walled on-premise machine. We let it run untouched for just over two years. No OS updates, no package updates. It was terrifying, but it was the client's explicit demand for stability over new features. The lesson was that \"uptime\" and \"security\" can sometimes mean different things to different customers. For our new company, Markhub, we're on the opposite end of the spectrum. We run a modern CI/CD pipeline on a cloud infrastructure. We deploy multiple times a week, sometimes multiple times a day. My takeaway is that the \"right\" answer depends entirely on the service's promise to the customer. For some, reliability means \"it never changes.\" For modern SaaS like ours, reliability means \"it's always improving and secure.\" The real challenge is building a system that can deliver both when needed—which is exactly what we had to architect for our first on-premise enterprise deal. reply",

Résumé/CV: https://rschenck.com/docs/cv.pdf Email: See CV above. I recently finished my PhD at the University of Copenhagen, where I worked on the functional array programming language Futhark ( https://futhark-lang.org/ ). My research focused on Futhark’s type system---including sum types and rank polymorphism---and on adding support for parallel automatic differentiation. Right now, I’m a postdoc at VU Amsterdam, working on hardware verification. Specifically, proving leakage properties of functional hardware descriptions (functional in the Haskell sense) in a composable way. See my CV or https://rschenck.com for a list of publications. I'm open to both academic and industry positions. I'm broadly interested in all things type systems/functional programming/compilers/language design.

I've bootstrapped full-stack apps, modernized crusty old ASP .NET services, reverse-engineered monstrous Rails codebases, built out multi-cloud infrastructure with third-party legacy VPN appliances in the mix, written Kubernetes Admissions Controllers, locally debugged services that need three reverse proxies to even function, and just this morning even managed to use my Aeropress inverted without spilling coffee all over my counter. I'd be a great fit for a medium-sized org or startup with PMF that wants to start building things on a good foundation.

Email: msanthoshreddy1308@gmail.com I’m a software engineer who thrives at the intersection of backend systems, cloud infrastructure, and data engineering. I’ve built and deployed fault-tolerant microservices handling thousands of requests per second, led API integrations that reduced manual operations by 60%, and implemented Spark-based data pipelines that brought down processing time from hours to minutes. My recent projects include: A passwordless authentication system using Flask, React, and AWS SES – enhancing UX and improving login conversion by 35%. An AI-powered job automation tool that scraped job boards, matched roles with resumes using NLP, and auto-applied – automating 80% of my job search. I’m actively seeking backend-focused Software Engineer roles (Java/Python preferred), or Full-Stack/Platform Engineer roles with strong ownership, system design, and cloud architecture challenges. I'm especially drawn to teams working on developer tooling, AI infra, or data-intensive products. Let’s build something meaningful. reply",

I started by developing MCU-based edge systems and their Unix-based servers.  My current work involves creation of custom Linux distributions for a variety of embedded systems, including board design, bring up, and new driver development. I have been involved with handheld IoT and backend devops longer than those reductive abbreviations have existed.  I have been committed to using open source tools and platforms for the past twenty five years, and I have worked directly to improve that ecosystem (e.g. GNU toolchain, OpenOCD, OpenEmbedded). I strongly prefer to produce open source solutions as well, but I have learned to be practical when it comes to building a business. I am looking for a fully remote position at the staff through founder level, helping to architect and build a new embedded platform in an interesting vertical.  I am interested in working with robotics, drones, 3-D printing, or other kinds of motorized and articulated systems. Technologies and markets that I will actively avoid include JavaScript/Java/PHP/Ruby, Microsoft products/platforms, off-site clouds, Anything-as-a-Service, fintech/cryptocurrencies, \"web3\", large/multinational businesses, government agencies, and similar engineering. reply",

At Uber, I’m a Developer Advocate for Cadence, the open-source workflow orchestration engine powering over 12 billion workflows per month. I work across teams to support adoption, resolve production issues, and scale distributed systems. At DoorDash, I was part of the Drive Merchant Services team, where I contributed to the migration from Django to Kotlin microservices by rewriting key customer support endpoints. I also designed and implemented a modular refund rules engine for our largest Drive partners, supporting flexible refund policies and internal operations tooling. I'm looking for an engineering-focused role where I can return to hands-on systems work, ideally with a strong technical team and a path toward engineering leadership (EM or CTO). I'm particularly interested in infrastructure, developer platforms, and systems in healthcare, logistics, finance, or defense. Outside of work, I enjoy sailing my 36’ boat around Puget Sound, riding my motorcycle, and diving deep into trivia across a range of interests. Let’s build something meaningful. reply",

I am Donovan Preston. I first became heavily involved with programming and open source software through the Twisted Python project. I then went on to work on the bulk of the early code for eventlet. Python asyncio is now a part of the standard library, and I like to think that these projects influenced the direction of async programming in Python. Later, I worked for Mozilla Research and then the Mozilla Services organizations. I helped with a project called dom.js (which now lives on as domino), implemented TCP and UDP apis for Firefox OS, worked on several experiments such as Firefox Screenshots (main developer at the beginning of the project) and Firefox Send (on the Android port). Finally, I worked on the port of the Firefox Sync server from Python to Rust. I gained extensive experience with ES.Next, React, TypeScript, and Rust. Now, I have a small consultancy and have worked on several Swift apps, in addition to HTML/CSS and full stack web applications. I am looking to work on a team again and in-person is preferrable, although remote is ok. reply",

I have 15 years of web experience building CMS and CRM for small and large companies. As a co-founder (as well as my prior years), I wore many hats and spent countless hours as a result I can architect and design large codebases, hire and retain talent, lead and manage teams and set company-wide goals. I built and managed an engineering team located all around the globe and built a platform empowering small and medium businesses to run their operations; the company is entering a new phase of growth and it is the right time for me to find opportunities that aligns with my personal goals. I am looking for a role at an established company. The bigger the problem, the more exciting. A perfect role for my profile may be one that blends my experience of building a successful B2B2C startup (building teams, product and software) and my experience of building B2B tools at a large company (Twitter).

While at Google, for five years I spent 20% time advising startups in Google's Launchpad Accelerator (now just called Google for Startups Accelerator) as an expert mentor on market assessment, pricing models, GTM strategy and organizing for sales-led growth. I'm well positioned to help startups & ISVs define a partner \nled growth strategy, unlock the mysteries of systems integrators, and create partner activation/enablement/GTM programs, having spent the past decade focused on these areas from multiple perspectives.

          "text": "Location: Los Angeles Remote: Yes Relocation: Case-by-case I'm a CTO, expert engineer, and data professional interested in team-building, consulting and architecting data pipelines. At Edmunds.com, I worked on a fairly successful ad-tech product and my team bootstrapped a data pipeline using Spark, Databricks, and microservices built with Java, Python, and Scala. At ATTN:, I re-built an ETL Kubernetes stack, including data loaders and extractors that handle >10,000 API payload extractions daily. I created SOPs for managing data interoperability with Facebook Marketing, Facebook Graph, Instagram Graph, Google DFP, Salesforce, etc. More recently, I was the CTO and co-founder of a gaming startup. We raised over $6M and I was in charge of building out a team of over a dozen remote engineers and designers, with a breadth of experience ranging from Citibank, to Goldman Sachs, to Microsoft. I moved on, but retain significant equity and a board seat. I am also a minority owner of a coffee shop in northern Spain. That I'm a top-tier developer goes without saying. I'm interested in flexing my consulting muscle and can help with best practices, architecture, and hiring. Would love to connect even if it's just for networking!

I think overall the problem is more along of the lines of mis-aligned/drifting incentives. It's like Goodhart's law, where whatever metric you use for outcomes tend to be manipulated or have unintended consequences. And putting in the trusted systems to identify bad/shifting metrics is costly in a way that makes outsourcing not worth it. In most cases, we've opted to build the data labeling operation in-house, so we have more control over the quality and can adjust on the fly. It's slower and more costly upfront, but better outcomes in the long run as we get higher quality data. reply",

Each finger was still hitting the same key like it would if I was using my right hand to hit the key but on my left hand.  This was fairly easy to accomplish on a QMK firmware keyboard (I was also already typing on a split keyboard so that might be part of the reason it was fairly easy to adjust).

This may be what you are referring to. I haven't tried it much but those layouts could be a temporary solution. I found Qwerty to be a lot easier to type one handed straight up because Dvorak tries to alternate hands between keys. I recently discovered Talon, an open source app for voice control of basically everything on a machine that requires no typing at all. I saw some people are using it even if they can use their hands, as a power tool. It appears to be fully Python scriptable and also gives you some nice speech to text abilities too. It allows you to specify a bunch of keywords for typing symbols and it looks like some people can do full coding quite quickly. Perhaps this injury could be an opportunity to try something like this and become more powerful than before? Best of luck and recovery to your friend. https://talonvoice.com/ reply",

But, I only needed it for a couple months. Like OP's relative, I also could not use my dominant arm, nor have my arm in a position that would allow typing one handed on a regular keyboard.  The twiddler was the only commercially available option that I was able to find that would allow me to type in this state.  So, another recommendation of twiddler, but with the caveat that the original had several warts, and while they appear to be redesigned, they may still suffer from some of them. The velcro strap to hold it to the hand, combined with the shape of the keyboard, allowed it to shift position while typing making it harder to use.  Photos of the current models show they have a different shape now.  Maybe this is less of a problem now?  They are also wireless now, so there isn't a wire constantly pulling it out of position whenever you move. The keyboard markings rubbed off completely after only a few weeks of use on my OG twiddler.  Hopefully they have worked that manufacturing issue out for the current models. reply",

Many people provide a rough spec, then either (shutter) vibe-code or edit substantially once it produces it. Having a RSI myself, I find that I can provide very detailed instructions in regular english, for which voice dictation works quite well to Cursor (but any others should work too), then it will produce code that I have to edit very little.  For most people this wouldn't be an efficient flow, but it greatly helps me reduce typing, thus is beneficial to me. With something like that, I believe you could do well pecking around with one hand for edits without needing to do much typing. On Mac, Karabiner-Elements is incredibly useful to remap things, such that you can enable things like mousekeys or otherwise that would keep from having to move (either) hand very much.  It's also a way to do as others have shown on this post and do a mirror layout or add something analogous to layers without having to buy new keyboards. reply",

          "text": "There is Edgar Matias's \"Half Keyboard\" layout, where the right hand's keys of a regular keyboard are mirrored on the left hand when holding a modifier key with your thumb.\nThe idea is that if you have learned touch-typing then muscle memory for the right hand should be available also on the left. Matias wrote an article [1] about it and then made it into a commercial product [2], but the concept should be possible on any programmable keyboard.\nPerhaps it would be possible with a AutoHotkey (MS-Windows) or Karabiner (MacOS) script otherwise. There is a large scene for more-or-less DIY \"ergonomic\" mechanical programmable keyboards with various different physical layouts, but common themes are 1) that they are split in a pair of two physical keyboards and 2) that they have multiple thumb-keys for modifiers / Return / Space. You could build and program just one half of such a pair.\nMany years ago I programmed an ErgoDox with the HalfKeyboard layout, just to try it out, and that ErgoDox I had built on a budget from mostly salvaged vintage components.

My 2 cents would be to try out a few existing possibilities before investing heavily on alternates. Sometimes all such just-for-the-time-extensions (or should I call it contraptions?) do not have a useful after life after the utilization or in-need-of period. I have had many injuries / broken bones (or at least 7 more times! (And please don't judge me based on this. I'm either that clumsy or those were freak incidents...)) and none that were created / acquired to help me out during those restricted movement periods have stayed with me...

          "text": "The best solution for me was to type with the left hand and switch from a mouse to a Logitech MX Ergo thumb-trackball — the key advantage is it can sit inside the sling and instantly give me full functionality. My use case was shoulder surgery that kept my dominant right hand in a sling for two+ months, but I could use my fingers after a week or so, and much of my work is CAD. It took only a few hours to completely get used to it, and I never went back to a mouse. While left-hand-only typing speed obviously went down, this was significantly mitigated by having a full function point-&-click device. It turns out this setup is also really helpful when working in tight spaces where a mouse is near-impossible, such as airplanes or tight luncheon booths. Even typing emails and multi-page documents left-handed was tolerable for 10 weeks, but if it had been longer, I probably would have looked into a chorded one-handed keyboard solution, as the learning cost would have been worth it. I hope this helps, and good on you for helping your friend, and I hope they get well fast! reply",

Honestly, if you aren't used to one handed typing its not worth the time to train to get good at it(I'm assuming they're right hand dominant) its all just muscle memory. If they can pick it up quickly go for it, keyboard bindings, or something like predictive text assistance, or even vim-like remappings are an interesting idea. IMO - if possible just peck-type(like an old lady who is learning to use a keyboard) or use text to speech/AI & editing where possible - like in emails. They shouldn't be using the left arm/hand much right after surgery anyway. If they're programming definitely not as easy but still doable. reply",

I figured the time was short enough that I would just use a regular keyboard, one handed, and live with the slowdown. It was annoying, certainly, and while I did get faster typing only with my left hand, I of course never got close to full speed. But it was fine, I survived, and I don't think it would have been worth spending the money, as well as the time to learn a new keyboard setup. Remember that a one-handed keyboard (or some other arrangement) isn't going to bring you back up to full speed immediately. It's probably going to take a few weeks to learn, and you might not even get back up to full speed at all. reply",

Dasher is fantastic, because it's based on rock solid information theory, designed by the late David MacKay. Here is the seminal Google Tech Talk about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpOxbesRNBc Here is a demo of using Dasher by an engineer at Google, Ada Majorek, who has ALS and uses Dasher and a Headmouse to program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvHQ83pMLQQ Another one of her demonstrating Dasher: Ada Majorek Introduction - CSUN Dasher https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvsSrClBwPM Here’s a more recent presentation about it, that tells all about the latest open source release of Dasher 5: Dasher - CSUN 2016 - Ada Majorek and Raquel Romano https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFlkM_e-sDg Here's the github repo: Dasher Version 4.11 https://github.com/GNOME/dasher >Dasher is a zooming predictive text entry system, designed for situations where keyboard input is impractical (for instance, accessibility or PDAs). It is usable with highly limited amounts of physical input while still allowing high rates of text entry. Ada referred me to this mind bending prototype: D@sher Prototype - An adaptive, hierarchical radial menu. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oSfEM8XpH4 >( http://www.inference.org.uk/dasher ) - a really neat way to \"dive\" through a menu hierarchy/, or through recursively nested options (to build words, letter by letter, swiftly). D@sher takes Dasher, and gives it a twist, making slightly better use of screen revenue. >It also \"learns\" your typical useage, making more frequently selected options larger than sibling options. This makes it faster to use, each time you use it. >More information here: http://beznesstime.blogspot.com and here: https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=960 Dasher is even a viable way to input text in VR, just by pointing your head, without a special input device! Text Input with Oculus Rift: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQgluUwV2U >As part of VR development environment I'm currently writing ( https://github.com/xanxys/construct ), I've implemented dasher ( http://www.inference.org.uk/dasher ) to input text. One important property of Dasher is that you can pre-train it on a corpus of typical text, and dynamically train it while you use it. It learns the patterns of letters and words you use often, and those become bigger and bigger targets that string together so you can select them even more quickly! Ada Majorek has it configured to toggle between English and her native language so she can switch between writing email to her family abroad and co-workers at google. Now think of what you could do with a version of dasher integrated with a programmer's IDE, that knew the syntax of the programming language you're using, as well as the names of all the variables and functions in scope, plus how often they're used! I have a long term pie in the sky “grand plan” about developing a JavaScript based programmable accessibility system I call “aQuery”, like “jQuery” for accessibility. It would be a great way to deeply integrate Dasher with different input devices and applications across platforms, and make them accessible to people with limited motion, as well as users of VR and AR and mobile devices. https://web.archive.org/web/20180826132551/http://donhopkins...

          "text": "You're proving exactly why I posted what I did. Nobody else has the time to watch a couple of 45 minute videos (several hours actually), so I took the time to do that myself (several more videos about Dasher than those, in fact), and summarize them for you. I've had email discussions about Dasher with people I mentioned like Ada Majorek (Google), also David Ward (Inference, who worked with the late David MacKay), Tom Doellstorff (UC Irvine), Donna Z. Davis (University of Oregon), and I've read several papers about it, and also the open source code on github, to understand how it works. So I took the time to summarize the points in the videos, the email discussions I've had, the papers I read, and source code I reviewed. https://www.inference.org.uk/djw30/ There are many interesting points and ideas I've tried to gather together and summarize, and I think Dasher is an important, underrated, not widely known piece of work, that can deeply improve many people's lives, which more people should know about. Not just people with a wide range of disabilities, but fully abled people without free time on their hands who frequently need to input lots of text quickly. That's why accessibility, diversity, equity, and inclusion are so important: they help everyone. Dasher a wonderful open source project to contribute to, and a solid foundation that needs to be brought up-to-date and re-implement it in terms of modern LLMs, AI assisted IDEs like Cursor, mobile, and VR/AR user interfaces. I don't have time to do all of that myself, but I hope to save other people time and effort by writing about it, and I hope to inspire students, researchers, software developers, hackers, and therapists who do have the time, interest, friends, loved ones, patients, and customers who could benefit from it. I'm sorry to hear about your disabilities of poor reading comprehension and trouble parsing text, and I'm envious that you have so much free time and nothing better to do, that you can take time to complain about your impatience with and intolerance of my writing. But it would have been easier, more efficient, and less stressful for you to simply ignore things you're not interested in rather than unconstructively whining with off-topic posts that benefit nobody. Obviously you don't appreciate how lucky you are to be able to type such a useless post so easily. I'm not even asking you to be empathic, or give a shit about anyone but yourself: if you're lucky enough to live long enough, you'll need accessibility tools like Dasher too. If you'd like to redeem yourself by writing a more useful constructive response to my post, then go right ahead, read my previous posts, watch all the videos, read all the papers and source code yourself, have some email discussions with other people using and working on Dasher, and then try to write a better summary, because your abstract summary above has absolutely no useful information, and isn't relevant to the discussion -- just a waste of your time and everyone else's. Or you could even take the trivial effort to paste my write-up into ChatGPT and post a summary, but that would be much lower quality and less enlightening than actually watching the videos and reading the articles and source code I cited yourself, but still better and more interesting than your current bitter off-topic \"contribution\" to the discussion. If it makes you feel better, I've written every word of this post personally just for you, MyPasswordSucks. No copying or pasting whatsoever (except the email at the end, with updated links to archive.org since my web site is offline, and I reformatted the transcript of Ada's video). Are you satisfied? Is that the attention you crave? Are my syntax and semantics comprehensible to you now? In return, what do you have to contribute to this discussion yourself, besides whining and criticizing form instead of substance? At least aaron695's rightfully flagged dead sibling comment unsuccessfully and incoherently attempted to criticize dasher itself, not just the messenger, so it was at least more on topic than you post. I hope you can do better. Here's the email I sent and the response that Ada Majorek wrote to me, using Dasher and headmouse. Since she was so swamped with work at Google, and it took her so much time and effort, even with Dasher, for her to reply to my email because she has ALS, I cherish her helpful reply, and I am glad you reminded me to share it, even if it annoys you to read so much thoughtful meticulously written text that she took the precious time out of her challenging life to write to me: ---- Hello! I’ve been a huge fan of Dasher for years! I'm sad to hear that David MacKay passed away. I knew of his work on Dasher, but am just discovering his great work on global warming. I’m happy to discover how Ada Majorek is carrying on his work, and that Dasher version 5 has been released! I developed and evaluated pie menus in the late 80’s and have used them in various games and applications, and more recently I’ve been doing mobile and VR programming with Unity3D. I’m interested in helping develop versions of Dasher on other platforms, especially Unity, and specifically for head mounted displays. Is anyone else working on that, with whom I could collaborate? I have a long term pie in the sky “grand plan” about developing a JavaScript based programmable accessibility system I call “aQuery”, like “jQuery” for accessibility. It would be a great way to deeply integrate Dasher with different input devices and applications across platforms, and make them accessible to people with limited motion, as well as users of VR and AR and mobile devices. https://web.archive.org/web/20180826132551/http://donhopkins... I’d be delighted to discuss Dasher and aQuery with anyone who’s interested! Here’s some discussion on hacker news, to which I contributed some comments about Dasher: A History of Palm, Part 1: Before the PalmPilot (lowendmac.com) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12306377 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12310029 -Don ---- Hi Don, I will write more soon. I was swamped with work last week. First, I am very happy to see your interest in Dasher.\nI don't have enough time to research another platform. I will be happy to give you walk through the code, and you can decide, if adding Unity is feasible. Is it possible to interface with C++ code on Uniy? There is Dasher Core. It is platform independent. And \"all\" you need to do is to extend several classes. Implementing it in Java Script is an interesting idea. You are second person suggesting it. Again, I will not have time to do it. But would gladly answer any questions. When you wrote about radial menus, I immediately thought of this prototype. Have you seen it before? D@sher Prototype - An adaptive, hierarchical radial menu: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oSfEM8XpH4 I better send half of the email now, than full email never ;-) Written with Dasher and Headmouse. :-) Ada ---- Thank you for your quick reply — I’m delighted to hear from you! Yes, it’s possible to interface native C++ code with Unity. It would also be possible to translate the C++ code to C#, which is a similar language (just cleaner and more modern). It’s also possible to compile C++ into JavaScript, but that makes it considerably harder to integrate with normal JavaScript code, so it might also be worth considering translating the C++ code to JavaScript by hand, to make it more efficient and better integrated with the browser. That adaptive hierarchical radial menu is wonderful! Thank you for linking me to that. I’ll contact the author and brainstorm ideas! That reminds me of a weird experiment I tried years ago: Here is a “precision pie menu” that I made for the NeWS window system, which lets you precisely select an angle by poking out of the circle and precisely dialing in an exact number with a flexible floppy line. I’ve never used it for anything practical, but it was a fun experiment! Precision Pie Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0scs59va4c Experiments like that are useful vehicles for exploring possibilities and generating new ideas, even if they aren’t directly useful themselves. You just can’t get very far by doing though experiments alone — you need to play with a working prototype and actually feel how it works, in order to decide how to improve it or design something different. It’s so cool you’re using Dasher and a Headmouse for everyday work, and that gives you so much experience and insight into how to use it best and make it better. So please don’t hesitate to send me half emails and half baked ideas, even if you don’t have the time to finish them! -Don ---- Ada Majorek on Dasher: [I reformatted her inspiring transcript, for people who don't have time to watch the three minute video, although it's well worth it to see how Dasher works.] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvHQ83pMLQQ ALS robbed me from ability to speak and ability to use computer keyboard. Thanks to Dasher I am still able to communicate at reasonable speed. Hi, my name is Ada. I want to talk about why I like Dasher. Since my ALS diagnosis in 2013 I tried countless number of alternative text entry and speech generation methods. So far Dasher is the fastest and least tiring. Dasher supports multiple languages. Very important for me, since I switch between English and Polish many times per day. I really like geeky origin of Dasher. It started as a visualization of arithmetic coding algorithm. Unfortunately at the time Dasher was not actively maintained. I was a software engineer in desperate need for a fast alternative communication tool. Dasher was an open-source project. I decided to start coding. With help of my friends and support of Google, we added many features making Dasher even better suited for alternative means of communication. And here we are today after almost 6 years of silence we are releasing a new version of Dasher: Dasher 5.00. If you know people with motor impairments or therapists, please let them know. They will like new features we have added. If you know programming, consider contributing to this very valuable project. And last but not least, if you worked on Dasher in the past, thank you very much from the bottom of my heart. reply",

He dropped links to videos, papers, GitHub, and even shared his personal emails with Ada Majorek, who uses Dasher because ALS stole her voice and hands. He made it clear he’d dug deep—watched hours of videos, pored over source code, talked to experts. He went all in to explain why Dasher deserves more love: it’s based on solid info theory, it learns your patterns, it’s openly extensible, and it works across languages and platforms—even VR. Someone named novosel chimed in asking why Don’s comment was downvoted, saying Dasher really is worth knowing. But then MyPasswordSucks blasted it as “barely-parsable copy-paste diarrhea” and declared Dasher awful, claiming the whole thing was off-topic. He sneered at Don’s effort, calling it useless. aaron695 piled on, arguing Dasher isn’t the answer for someone with a short-term injury and criticizing Don’s wall of text even more harshly. DonHopkins didn’t back down. He defended his post, pointed out how much final work he put in—no copying or pasting. He reminded people Ada had replied personally, highlighting how essential Dasher is for her. He got indignant about people whining instead of appreciating the depth of his write-up. In short, DonHopkins delivered a massive, heartfelt case for Dasher. Critics flamed him for style and focus. The result: a messy, heated debate between someone who’s poured years into accessibility work and anonymous commenters who can’t be bothered to look beyond a giant block of text. reply",

          "text": "What's magnificent about Dasher is that it works with so many modalities, like eye tracking, suck tube, pressing a single button and waiting, etc. It's able to extract the maximum number of bits of text per minute from the minimum amount of bits of input per minute, harnessing every input device to its fullest potential. It also seamlessly supports multiple languages, it can be pre-trained on examples of what you write so it adapts to your vocabulary and gives your favorite words more shelf space on the Library of Babel, and you can include symbols and control functions too. You could even have an \"emoji\" branch where you spell out the :smile: codes, constrained to just the defined codes so it's easier to select them (and see the growing emojis as you get near to spelling them out all the way), incrementally learning your favorites and making them easier to pick. It drives me nuts how we blindly accept these ancient, kludgy input methods -- QWERTY is the biggest offender, but let’s not forget those shitty swipe keyboards that think gliding your thumb over letters is somehow “intuitive,” or the garbled cell-phone autocomplete systems that keep mangling your sentences until they’re barely recognizable, then texting embarrassing obscenities to your mom. Dasher is in a league of its own. Instead of shoving you into a historically fixed grid of scrambled letters, or forcing you to hunt and peck through a list of predicted but unpredictable words, Dasher treats writing as a continuous journey through a probability landscape! You don’t tap tiny squares or hope the AI guesses what you meant, you literally “dive” into the next letter or word that’s statistically most likely. Maximum text output for minimum physical effort, without any of the guesswork or awkward ergonomics baked into hunt-n-pecking QWERTY, slippery swipe tricks, or psychotic autocomplete engines. reply",

So, brush up if needed.) - Install the required Toolchains, compilers, and I am assuming you have the necessary hardware to play around - Github links with CUDA projects. Read the code, And now you could use LLM to explain the code in the way you would need - Start creating smaller, yet parallel programs etc., etc., And in about a month or two, you should have enough to start writing CUDA programs. I'm not aware of the skill / experience levels you have, but whatever it might be, there are plenty of sources and resources available now than it was in 2007/08. Create a 6-8 weeks of study plan and you should be flying soon! Hope it helps. Feel free to comment and I can share whatever I could to guide. reply",

Older GPUs than Turing should be avoided, because they lack many capabilities of the newer cards, e.g. \"tensor cores\", and their support in the newer CUDA toolkits will be deprecated in a not very distant future, but very slowly, so for now you can still create programs for Maxwell GPUs from 10 years ago. Among the newer GPUs, the RTX 40xx SUPER series (i.e. the SUPER variants, not the original RTX 40xx series) has the best energy efficiency. The newest RTX 50xx GPUs have worse energy efficiency than RTX 40xx SUPER, so they achieve a somewhat higher performance only by consuming a disproportionately greater power.

          "text": "I looked at the CUDA code for Leela Chess Zero and found it pretty understandable, though that was back when Leela used a DCNN instead of transformers.  DCNN's are fairly simple and are explained in fast.ai videos that I watched a few years ago, so navigating the Leela code wasn't too difficult.  Transformers are more complicated and I want to bone up on them, but I haven't managed to spend any time understanding them. CUDA itself is just a minor departure from C++, so the language itself is no big deal if you've used C++ before.  But, if you're trying to get hired programming CUDA, what that really means is they want you implementing AI stuff (unless it's game dev).  AI programming is a much wider and deeper subject than CUDA itself, so be ready to spend a bunch of time studying and hacking to come up to speed in that.  But if you do, you will be in high demand.  As mentioned, the fast.ai videos are a great introduction. In the case of games, that means 3D graphics which these days is another rabbit hole.  I knew a bit about this back in the day, but it is fantastically more sophisticated now and I don't have any idea where to even start. reply",

This is something that changes with times and trends. 2. Learning high-performance computing approaches. While a GPU and the Nvlink interfaces are Nvidia specific, working in a massively-parallel distributed computing environment is a general branch of knowledge that is translatable across HPC architectures. 3. Application specifics. If your thing is Transformers, you may just as well start from Torch, Tensorflow, etc. and rely on the current high-level abstractions, to inspire your learning down to the fundamentals. I’m no longer active in any of the above, so I can’t be more specific, but if you want to master CUDA, I would say learning how massive-parallel programming works, is the foundation that may translate into transferable skills. reply",

Disclaime: I don't claim that this is actually a systematic way to learn it and it is more for academic work. I got assigned to a project that needs learning CUDA as part of my PhD. There was no one in my research group who have any experience or know CUDA. I started with standard  NVIDIA courses (Getting Started with Accelerated Computing with CUDA C/C++ and there is python version too). This gave me good introduction to the concepts and basic ideas but I think after that I did most of learning by trial and error. I tried a couple of online tutorials for specific things and some books but it was always a deprecated function there or here or a change of API that make things obsolete. Or basically things changed for your GPU and now you have to be careful because yoy might be using GPU version not compatible with what I develop for in production and you need things to work for both. I think learning CUDA for me is an endeavor of pain and going through \"compute-sanitizer\" and Nsight because you will find that most of your time will go into debugging why things is running slower than you think. Take things slowly. Take a simple project that you know how to do without CUDA then port it to CUDA ane benchmark against CPU and try to optimize different aspect of it. The one advice that can be helpful is not to think about optimization at the beginning. Start with correct, then optimize.  A working slow kernel beats a fast kernel that corrupts memory. reply",

First create an environment so that you can actually test your kernels against baselines written in a higher-level language.\n2. If you don't have an urgent project already, try to improve/re-implement existing problems (MatMul being the first example). Don't get caught by wanting to implement all size cases. Take an example just to learn a certain functionality, rather than solving the whole problem if it's just about learning.\n3. Write the functionality you want to have in increasing complexity. Write loops first, then parallelize these loops over the grid. Use global memory first, then put things into shared memory and registers. Use plain matrix multiplication first, then use mma (TensorCore) primitives to speed things up.\n4. Iterate over the CUDA C Programming Guide. It covers all (most) of the functionality that you want to learn - but can't be just read an memorized. When you apply it you learn it.\n5. Might depend on you use-case but also consider using higher-level abstractions like CUTLASS or ThunderKitten. Also, if your environment is jax/torch, use triton first before going to CUDA level. Overall, it will be some pain for sure. And to master it including PTX etc. will take a lot of time. reply",

The skills needed for CUDA are completely unrelated to building machine learning models. It's like learning to make a TLS library so you can get a full stack web development job. The skills are completely orthogonal. CUDA belongs to the domain of game developers, graphics people, high performance computing and computer engineers (hardware). From the point of view of machine learning development and research, it's nothing more than an implementation detail. Make sure you are very clear on what you want. Most HR departments cast a wide net (it's like how every junior role requires \"3-5 years of experience\" when in reality they don't really care). Similarly when hiring, most companies pray for the unicorn developer who can understand the entire stack from the GPU to the end user product domain when the day to day is mostly in Python. reply",

          "text": "I had a bit, limited, exposure to cuda. It was before the AI boom, during Covid. I found it easy to start. Then there was a pretty nice learning curve to get to warps, SM's and basic concepts. Then I was able to dig deeper into the integer opcodes, which was super cool. I was able to optimize the compute part pretty well, without much roadblocks. However, getting memory loads perfect and then getting closer to hw (warp groups, divergence, the L2 cache split thing, scheduling), was pretty hard. I'd say CUDA is pretty nice/fun to start with, and it's possible to get quite far for a novice programmer. However getting deeper and achieving real advantage over CPU is hard. Additionally there is a problem with Nvidia segmenting the market - some opcodes are present in _old_ gpu's (CUDA arch is _not_ forwards compatible). Some opcodes are reserved to \"AI\" chips (like H100). So, to get code that is fast on both H100 and RTX5090 is super hard. Add to that a fact that each card has different SM count and memory capacity and bandwidth... and you end up with an impossible compatibility matrix. TLDR: Beginnings are nice and fun. You can get quite far on the optimizing compute part. But getting compatibility for differnt chips and memory access is hard. When you start, chose specific problem, specific chip, specific instruction set. reply",

That doesn't mean one-eyed-king knowledge is never enough to solve that chicken-and-egg. You only have to be good enough to get the job. But if you haven't done it on the job, you don't have work experience and you are either lying to others or lying to yourself...and any sophisticated organization won't fall for it... ...except of course, knowingly. And the best way to get someone to knowingly ignore obvious dunning-kruger and/or horseshit is to know that someone personally or professionally. Which is to say that the best way to get a good job is to have a good relationship with someone who can hire you for a good job (nepotism trumps technical ability, always). And the best way to find a good job is to know a lot of people who want to work with you. To put it another way, looking for a job is the only way to find a job and looking for a job is also much much harder than everything that avoids looking for a job  (like studying CUDA) by pretending to be preparation...because again, studying CUDA won't ever give you professional experience. Don't get me wrong,  there's nothing wrong with learning CUDA all on your own. But it is not professional experience and it is not looking for a job doing CUDA. Finally, if you want to learn CUDA just learn it for its own sake without worrying about a job. Learning things for their own sake is the nature of learning once you get out of school.

          "text": "(I worked at a different processing company, which I am not speaking for.) We're struggling to find the motive or intended outcome by the attacker(s). The highest likelihood for me is that they're doing card/credential testing. They have either stolen or purchased a large number of stolen credentials. Those credentials are worth more individually if they are known to function. They can use any business on the Internet which sells anything and would tell someone \"Sorry, can't sell you that because I couldn't charge your account/card/etc. Do you have another one?\" to quickly winnow their set of credentials into a pile of ones which haven't been canceled yet and another pile. Another variation of this attack is their list is \"literally just enumerate all the cards possible in a range and try to sift down to the cards that actually exist.\" After sifting through to find the more valuable cards, they sell this onto another attacker at higher price of the mixed-working-and-not-working cards, or they pass it to their colleague who will attempt to hit the cards/creds for actual money. Digital items are useful because people selling them have high margins and have lower defenses against fraud as a result. Cheap things, especially cheap things where they can pick their price, are useful because it is less likely to trigger the attention of the card holder or their bank. (This is one reason charities get abused very frequently, because they will often happily accept a $1 or lower donation, even one which is worth less than their lowest possible payment processing cost.) The bad guys don't want to be noticed because the real theft is in the future, by them or (more likely) by someone they sell this newly-more-valuable card information onto. This hit the company I used to run back in the day, also on Paypal, and was quite frustrating. I solved it by adding a few heuristics to catch and giving a user matching those heuristics the product for free, with the usual message they got in case of a successful sale. This quickly spoils your website for the purpose they're trying to use it for, and the professional engineering team employed to abuse you experiences thirty seconds of confusion and regret before moving to the next site on their list. Back in the day, the bad guys were extremely bad at causing their browser instance to even try to look like a normal user in terms of e.g. pattern of data access prior to attempting to buy a thing. Hope some of that is useful. Best of luck and skill. You can eventually pierce through to Paypal's attention here and they may have options available contingent on you being under card/credential testing attack, or they might not. I was not successful in doing so back in the day prior to solving the problem for myself. Would also recommend building monitoring so you know this is happening in the future before the disputes roll in. Note that those disputes might be from them or from the legitimate users depending on exactly what credentials they have stolen, and in the case they are from legitimate users, you may not have caught all of the fraudulent charges yet. (Mentioning because you said \"all of the charges\" were disputed.) If I were you I'd try to cast a wider net and pre-emptively refund or review things in the wider net, both because the right thing to do and also because you may be able to head off more disputes later as e.g. people get their monthly statements. reply",

When the threat level is high, you require an exact match AVS.  You might have more agressive filtering at the IP level, real users generally won't be datacenter IPs.  Pay attention to the ASN, sometimes you'll get an attack from a network that legit customers never use, so you can just block the whole network.  Keep an eye on your logs, you'll notice patterns.  The attack is likely coming from a single entity, if you make it difficult to abuse your service, then they will move on. reply",

          "text": "This is a money laundering scheme where they are trying out how far they can go per domain. It's also a bug in the paypal API that they're abusing, where the SDK doesn't differ between example.com and www.example.com. If webshops like yours get exploited and used for money laundering, they will mix transactions from those two subdomains, while leaving the www.example.com domain as it is. The support people at paypal are dumb enough to not take care about each case, and usually they mix transactions later also via other social media services that have microtransactions (e.g. tiktok or snapchat streams where you can gift away items). The way paypal support's workflow works is that they have to nanually identify each and every transaction separately, meaning a human will be busy for weeks on end. Not kidding you. That's how the scammers keep winning with schemes like this. Usually there's also no way to escalate this, not even for business customers, at paypal, due to how their support offices are structured organizationally. As a mitigation I'd recommend to block ASNs that are known hosters that do this, and double check your webshop version for known vulnerabilities and fixes. If you don't use docker already, start to virtualize your webshop software now. I can't stress how important this is. Also double check any users and passwords you are using for the services, and the rest of the filesystem for indicators on the VPS. Disable SSH passwords and use only SSH key authentication on the VPS in case this hasn't been done already. I'm writing this because usually this kind of scheme starts to happen after the server got pwned already, and after e.g. the ssh password bruteforce scanner was successful or after the web exploit / persistence exploit was successful. If you need a starting point to block those botnet affiliated networks, I started both a firewall and scam database project that does exactly this: [1] https://github.com/cookiengineer/antispam [2] https://github.com/tholian-network/firewall reply",

If you are a beginner, instead make sure you don't run services as the sudo-capable/root user as a first step.\nThen, I would recommend you look into Systemd services: you can configure all the Linux sandboxing features Docker uses and more.\nThis composes well with Podman, which gives you a reproducible environment (drop-in replacement for Docker) but contained to an unprivileged user. reply",

Running a new ubuntu 18.04 container does not start a new OS kernel running. the process for your container is just 'firewalled' off from all other processes using cgroups [0]. containers re-use the host's kernel, start a cgroup'd process which starts your container's services and processes (the 18.04 'OS' services and your binary/code/executable). short/simpler version: containers share the core of the underlying operating system on the host server. > If you want actual isolation you have to take extra steps. unfortunately, this means containers share the core of the underlying operating system on the host server. containers not being isolated from the host server OS can present a security risk as you can escape from the container and \"do bad things to host server\". [1] In cases where that is a problem you mostly have two choices: * use VMs instead (a completely isolated OS instance is started for each service, cannot interact with the host OS at all -- this uses a lot more memory/cpu) * use rootless containers [2] (container processes are launched under a specific user namespace rather than kernel namespace -- escaping the container means you only get access to the user namespace) [0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups [1]: by default the docker daemon service and all the container processes it starts are running as root, which means escaping out of a container in a a default docker installation is as bad as giving someone root.

          "text": "Im not op and I’m not sure they are using it for money laundering. A money launderer can use a marketplace by creating a seller account and buying from himself. Since he’s the one buying he doesn’t need to deliver anything but he gets the money from a legit source. Usually he would use a payment method as close to money as possible so that it leaves less traces. But in OPs case, the amounts are low so he needs too many transactions to get something valuable. And because of the disputes, he’s (probably) not getting the money (?). It could be card testing: the fraudster has a bunch of cards and doesn’t know which is valid or canceled. The best way to find out is to test in a real site. So he’ll test out each of them and the ones that go through are good to use elsewhere. The thing is that it would be better for him not to dispute the transactions so the OP would take much longer to find out about the scheme and shut it down. It’s better to use low amount transactions in this case so it doesn’t use too much of the credit available for him to defraud and probably doesn’t warn the card owner. Another option is doing it just to hurt the OP marketplace. If you have too many disputes the brands can fine you and if you don’t solve the problem they can turn your account off. I’ve seen it happen when a competitor was trying to hurt the e-commerce. It’s a low move and rare but it happens. One thing that might help is to analyze the sellers too. In a money laundering and even in the other settings, it could be part of the scheme. Are they new accounts? Are their volume exploding out of nowhere? Etc reply",

But, is this not easily spotted when the food import(?) cost doesn't match the revenue? Maybe I just answered my own question, if the business is able to cook the books both ways, but it would also limit how much they're able to launder.

It was great because it was definitely impressive to order a round of patrons shots for everyone at the bar.

          "text": "+1. As mentioned on the side, this will negatively impact your conversion rate. But you don't need to leave it on forever, either; you can use it to get some breathing room. The attacker may lose interest or move on to more fruitful targets if they find themselves blocked even temporarily. This is the \"don't need to be faster than the bear\" dynamic of online fraud: there are infinite targets and you don't need to perfectly shut out an attacker to make the ROI unappealing for them. My thoughts on the scenario: 1. Chargebacks are not just a financial problem. There is no amount of money you can pay to regain the trust of your sellers (as it's a marketplace) or to change terms with your payment providers. 2. If the emails come from the same domain, can you block the domain? There are lots of throwaway domains, but it's effort for the attacker to switch them, too. 3. CAPTCHAs are increasingly ineffective between captcha solving services and multi-modal AI. I've heard in a few recent attacks that hCaptcha does a little better than Turnstile or reCAPTCHA. 4. Shadowbanning is good for wasting your attacker's time, which is really important to kill their ROI. You'll need to get your false positive rate low though to not piss off your actual good customers. 5. Your scenario (no API, browser required, no bot activity expected) is a really good fit for properly implemented device fingerprinting. I'm the PM for Fraud & Security at Stytch and we do have a Device Fingerprinting product. It's harder to trial than the open-source ones, but the advantage is that attackers can't inspect the implementation to evade it. Would you be interested in talking more? I'm happy to walk through your current controls and see if it makes sense to test Device Fingerprinting, shoot me an email at (first letter of my username) + (last four letters of my username) @ stytch.com . reply",

Be willing to temporarily suspend your services in order to prevent the malicious behavior. Do the manual work to allow genuine customers to keep using your service, e.g: require manual account approval. You need to treat every one of these chargeback transactions as a risk to your businesses ability to operate, each that you allow to happen increases the risk of permanent damage to your business. Reach out to your account manager at PayPal, this is not something that should be going via frontline support. You need to be talking to a person who knows and is responsible for your account. If you don’t have one, get one. If you can’t get one, look for anti payment fraud businesses that work with PayPal, they may be able to get a direct line to PayPal on your behalf. For the future, if you’re dependent upon a service provider you should always have someone you can reach out to directly. If a provider isn’t willing to offer that, find a different provider. Financial services especially are very risk averse and will jettison your account if they get even a whiff of something untoward, whether you tried to prevent it or not. The cost of recovering from that will dwarf the cost of any drastic mitigation you take now. Losing your PayPal account is worse than turning off purchases for a few days. reply",

Our rule taking PayPal: Transfer EVERYTHING out of your PayPal account on a daily basis, do not let them hold your funds, they will block you from accessing it at some point. Minimize what they can touch. Also don't all smaller amounts to be paid with PayPal. This prevents you from being abused as a source for verifying stolen accounts. The only company I dealt with that came close to the same level of incompetency was Klarna. Klarna didn't at the time understand the concept of fraud, because they're Swedish and their system in Sweden MOSTLY prevented fraud at the time. Once people found away around that and Klarna expanded beyond Sweden, they gave up and attempted to stick the bill on us, despite their contracts clearly stated that they where responsible for collecting payments. reply",

A few things that helped us:\n– Browser fingerprinting (FingerprintJS or even basic user agent + behavior tracking)\n– Logging full headers + TLS fingerprints — IPs rotate, but some other patterns leak through\n– Introduce small friction in the payment flow (e.g. lightweight CAPTCHA or JS challenge)\n– Look at timing patterns — automation tends to work in strict intervals PayPal support is notoriously slow for anything that’s not cookie-cutter. Try emailing merchanttechsupport@paypal.com — they’ve been more useful in escalated cases. This kind of thing is more common than you’d think, especially for platforms selling digital goods. reply",

A good example are unsolvable and ridiculously captchas.

          "text": "> often you can pay by card at the pump. That’s definitely an innovation that creates convenience but does it really change the commercial function of the station much?  You are still essentially transacting for fuel, which is what gas stations have done for decades.  My guess is while a lot of stations provide that ability out of customer demand, but the owners would probably rather the customer come in and buy the over priced soda and Doritos along with the gas purchase.  I don’t think owner-operators make hardly anything on the fuel sales. With my comment I was thinking more along the lines of overall footprint of the station and what products are being sold.  I think self-service pushed the ability for stations to service more pumps and with a person anchored to a register inside instead of outside attending to the pumps, it allowed the ability of stations to expand to more a mini-mart concept easily where more profitable products (to the station owner) are sold. EV charging might help bring people into the food, but i suspect you don’t “turn tables” fast enough to make EV charging beneficial enough to bringing enough people inside to warrant devoting a lot of space to that activity. reply",

Meanwhile almost all new cars here are BEV, even out in many rural areas BEVs are 50% of new sales. A local store can relatively easily and cheaply install a supercharger. Installing a hydrogen pump is presumably much more expensive as it requires more space and more complex equipment. And it needs refilling by truck, while electricty just flows. And while EV chargers or cars can catch fire during charging, hydrogen can explode violently[1][2] when mixed with air (the one in Norway registered as an earthquake 30 km, 20 miles, away). As I said perhaps it will find some niche uses, but widescale adoptation seems very unlikely to me. [1]: https://norwaytoday.info/news/explosion-sandvika-hydrogen-ta...

Driving longer that 200 miles means you probably want a decent break. So I would imagine that most \"local\" places will disappear / pivot into shops with EV charging also. Motorway services will also change I think. Fast food isnt as much of an appeal when you're stuck there for an hour or so anyway. So I could see a rise in retrain complexes with charging abilities. possibly changes in behaviour will also affect things. If im traveling 4-6hrs in a day, id be ok with stopping of for an hour at a shopping centre where I could charge and also do some shopping, maybe let the kids play in a softplay or whatever The first clever folks to stick a bull ring within 5 minutes drive of the M6 will 200+ charging points will do VERY well I think. reply",

          "text": "The process has already begun - UK petrol station numbers are down by a third since the beginning of the century. As you say, they'll all but cease to exist in urban areas, with the process mostly complete by the end of the 2030s. I'm not sure that dedicated EV charging stations will be all that common in cities, though. Why not use existing car parks for that? Some probably will end up being used as surface car parks where there's demand for it, but urban land values are such that I suspect most will be knocked down and replaced with apartments or larger retail units. A few may retain the forecourt structures as a form of kitsch (think of the florists beside Regents Park in London, or the Hyde Park Book Club in Leeds). There'll probably be a growing niche for domestic fuel delivery services. You might also see a minor resurgence of the very small neighbourhood filling stations that mostly died out in the 1970s/80s - the sort of place that does MOT checks or tyre changes today. Some might end up installing a pump or two, to cater for vintage car enthusiasts. reply",

While it's true they still do these things, or try to, in my experience nobody actually uses them because of understaffing and underpaying of employees to the point of them not caring. Who wants a brown hot dog or dried out taquito that's been on a roller for who knows how many days?  Who wants soda from moldy taps?  Who wants to stand in line to change out propane, to be told there's only one person working, go out and wait til the line is gone?  Air is still free, but you have to go in and ask for it to be turned on. At least that's my experience, maybe each locale is different.  I literally have never seen a person buy prepared food or exchange propane at a typical gas station(wawa/buckees excluded) in my adult life. reply",

Whether we staff or not depends on if we adopt Japanese culture. In Tokyo they have unattended fast food shops, and somewhat novelty robot servers at some restaurants.

They have a squirrel for a mascot and sometimes if you go there's someone dressed up as the mascot there. Inside, it's not a traditional restaurant but they're well known for selling barbecue (e.g. brisket).

          "text": "I feel the concept of EV charging might be democratized. These are the problems with EV stations: It takes a while to charge up. No matter what, only a very few people can be accommodated at once. On the flip side, setting up a gas station is hard, but that’s not the case with EV charging stations — especially if battery swapping is innovated. It also takes time to deeply penetrate the market, but EV charging is much more suitable for two-wheelers. So there’s a clear gap — the current gas stations can’t handle the volume of people waiting for EV charging. What is the way forward? I feel anyone with an EV charger can set up an EV charging station at home. This means all your malls, houses, and parks might be converted into EV charging stations, making it much more decentralized. I anticipate that anyone with an EV charger and good parking space can make some extra bucks from it. I feel the whole idea of gas stations might be democratized. I’m not sure — this is just what I feel. Feel free to let me know your opinion. reply",

          "text": "Connecting EV charging stations to the grid is a significant problem. Balancing the peak grid maximum demand* against EV charging demand. While it may be okay to have a busy highway/motorway service station properly hooked up, it get's more difficult to apply that more broadly. How much charging capacity should a shopping centre provide? What about a occasionally-used sports venue? I have worked with customers that have distribution centres in city locations to charge online-shopping vehicles overnight for the next day. All vehicles are plugged in and the software needs to charge different vehicles up at different times and rates, in order to spread the load. It is far easier to dig a hole in the ground and fill a tank with delivered fuel - all the logistics for this already exists. * Maximum demand is a well-known concept that relates to the maximum current draw in a 30-minute period, which is used to provide the necessary infrastructure from the electricity supplier. reply",

          "text": "Why not? These fleets have been quasi electric since the 1970s They move slowly on dedicated predictable paths all controlled by the same system that choreographs their movements, controls who goes in for system charges.  Some of them are EV in the sense they use electricity but they have no batteries.  More of them now have batteries but they can in no way be compared to the usage patterns of human use cases.  This is why batteries have been viable for them since the 70's.  Massive inefficient monsters on slow moving controlled paths.   Some of them charge whilst moving using massive cables laid out in the roads in the mine.  In a mine slow and steady wins the race.  In the rest of the world it would be chaos or more specifically not viable. Big-rigs also make sense as the fleet owned and controlled trucks can charge at dedicated yards and will all move in coordinated efforts. There are still no viable 3500 through 7500 series trucks operated by small to medium business owners and those run the short haul of many industries in the USA.  As such the diesel versions of them will be around for a very long time.  I keep an eye on battery tech for my own selfish reasons and have yet to see anything that would power those trucks without pushing them over their weight limits to the point of making them legally unusable.  As is business owners skirt the line when they are on the scales.  Heavy batteries would require them to cut their loads and effectively also eat their profits and waste a lot of their time making multiple trips.  If they become viable I will see it right away as I am surrounded by them and business owners will do what makes financial sense.  I will be the first to change opinions on this when it is a profitable option. The closest I have yet to see in Science Fiction levels of battery improvement is 3D printed solid state batteries and they have a long way to go just to make it into tools, cell phones, etc...  That needed to happen a decade ago if we want to see them in big trucks within 15 years.  I would love to be proven wrong ... for my own selfish reasons unrelated to electric vehicles. reply",

Then we will start to see more EV chargers than gas stations. Advancements in AI might make it possible to have attendant-less stations if you can have automated sales of snacks and other merchandise, and automated payments for chargers and gas, maybe you don't need an attendant on duty 24/7 reply",

I dont get why we're comparing F150s to the Model Y. When Im looking to buy a truck, Im not considering the Model Y (although In peeved the Ranger isnt hybrid). I have never considered a Tesla (Im not in the market for another sedan) but if I were my comparison would be something like the Accord. But sure let's compare the F150 to the model Y: back in 2021 - a base F150 weighed about 4000lb, less than a base Model Y and an F150 supercab V6 F150 was <4500 lb. [1] A long range model Y weighs about a little bit less, but the difference is less than 100 lb. Sure, I can configure the F150 to weigh 5500, but few need to and few do. So the point stands: The Model Y weighs as much as a half ton truck. Meanwhile a Ford Maverick, a truck Ford can't make enough to meet demand, weighs 3700 lb [1] https://media.ford.com/content/dam/fordmedia/North%20America... reply",

It's why semis don't have to make a pit stop every 2 miles for new tires.

Because one is the most popular gas car, the other the most popular EV. Removing an engine and adding batteries increases weight, sure, but that doesn't have anything to do with the average weight that's on the road. You have to tax things based on what's actually out there, not what _would_ be out there if you took the existing fleet and turned them EV. Batteries are expensive, so there's incentive not to use so much and make the car smaller and more efficient instead. That doesn't happen with gas cars. > A long range model Y weighs about a little bit less, but the difference is less than 100 lb. Yeah, I know. That's all I was saying. You said the average EV weighed more. In fact, it's less. It is more stark than that, though. The most popular F150 in 2025 is the Lariat SuperCrew, which has a 5300 lb curb weight. The model Y has a curb weight of 4400 pounds. The next most popular gas car is some Chevy pickup. The next more popular EV is the Model 3.",

I suggest a simple process, one that I have used in the past: Make a list of at least 5, pref 10+ potential investors.\n    Rank them in order of how much you would like them to invest.\n    Start with the lowest one on the list\n        Present and gather feedback\n        Refine pitch deck to incorporate feedback\n    Repeat with next investor, working up the list, repeat the feedback and refinement process. Ideally by the time you reach your more ideal investors, your pitch deck is much improved and you increase your chances of a favorable outcome. In fact, you could end up with bidding rounds. reply",

Your process of working up from least preferred to most preferred investors is brilliant and something I wish I'd known earlier. I'm thinking the tool might be more useful in the prep phase, before you even reach out to that first investor on your list. The goal wouldn't be to replace your process, but maybe help founders feel more confident before that first real conversation? Especially founders who don't have experienced networks to practice with initially.

I'm thinking most early founders don't have that kind of network though, maybe that's why they're getting much softer feedback.

I am also eyeing whisperX[2], because I want to play some more with speaker diarization. Your use-case seems to be batch transcription, so I'd suggest you go ahead and just use whisperfile, it should work well on an M4 mini, and it also has an HTTP API if you just start it without arguments. If you want more interactivity, I have been using Vibe[3] as an open-source replacement of SuperWhisper[4], but VoiceInk from a sibling comment seems better. Aside: It seems that so many of the mentioned projects use whisper at the core, that it would be interesting to explicitly mark the projects that don't use whisper, so we can have a real fundamental comparison.

          "text": "That's a great question, as the transcription stack landscape is evolving quickly. As the founder of an AI collaboration platform (Markhub), we've tested several options for our own internal \"AI teammate,\" MAKi. Our stack is a hybrid approach, as we've found no single service is best for everything: For Real-Time & High-Volume Transcription: We use Google's Speech-to-Text API (via Vertex AI). We found its accuracy with various accents and noisy environments to be top-tier, which is critical for turning real-world meeting audio into usable data. It's not the cheapest, but the reliability is worth it for our core product. For Bundled Transcription + Summarization (What you're asking about): You're right to look at models that can handle this in one go. We use Gemini for this exact purpose. The ability to send an audio file and get back a structured summary, not just a raw transcript, is a huge workflow accelerator. We point our audio data to the model and ask it to not only transcribe but also extract action items, which is a core feature of our platform. For Local/CLI Batching (As you mentioned): We've had great success with OpenAI's Whisper running in a containerized environment for internal, less time-sensitive tasks. Using a fine-tuned version of Whisper on a dedicated machine for batch processing can be very cost-effective. Your M4 mini should be able to handle the base models of Whisper quite well, especially using a tool like whisper.cpp. My takeaway: For a production API, a robust cloud service like Google's or a powerful model like Gemini is more reliable. For local or batch processing, a self-hosted Whisper setup is a fantastic and powerful option. Good luck! reply",

          "text": "A combination of engines generally gets the best WER with additional cost. hosted whisper + gemini 2.5 flash lite with custom deconfliction based on what each one does best is a reasonable path. Gemini does general conversation and silence better than whisper v3 large but whisper v3 large does better specialty vocab. Of course both after and before the merge, common transcription errors are fixed with a dictionary based lookup (that preserves punctuation, etc). This combo stays multi-lingual and is pretty cheap but is complex. There are better single source transcription vendors out there but they generally fail to either provide multi-lingual, or to provide timing info or are ridiculously expensive, or or or... I think the next gen of multi-modal models will make this all moot as they will likely crush transcription. Gemini shows that direction right now. OpenAI does a bad job of it but is in the game. Anthropic is surprisingly not really engaged in this yet (but they did just announce real time audio so they gotta be thinking about it). reply",

I have a (few years old) copy of Library Genesis converted to plaintext and it's around 1TB. I think libgen proper was 50-100TB at the time, so we can probably assume that AA (~1PB) would be around 10-20TB when converted to plaintext. You'd probably spend several weeks torrenting a chunk of the archive, converting everything in it to plaintext, deleting the originals, then repeating with a new chunk until you have plaintext versions of everything in the archive. Then indexing all that for full text search would take even more storage and even more time, but still perfectly doable on commodity hardware. The main barriers are going to be reliably extracting plaintext from the myriad of formats in the archive, cleaning up the data, and selecting a decent full text search database (god help you if you pick wrong and decide you want to switch and re-index everything later). reply",

Converting media that is currently completely un-indexed into plaintext and offering a suite of search features for finding content within it would be a game-changer, IMO! If you've ever done a lit review for any field other than ML, I'm guessing you know how reliant many fields are on relatively-old books and articles (read: PDFs at best, paper-only at worst) that you can basically only encounter via a) citation chains, b) following an author, or c) encyclopedias/textbooks. 2. I really don't see how this could ever lead to any kind of legal issue. You're not hosting any of the content itself, just offering a search feature for it. GoodReads doesn't need legal permission to index popular books, for example. In general I get the sense that your comment is written from the perspective of an entrepreneur/startup mindset. I'm sure that's brought you meaning and maybe even some wealth, but it's not a universal one! Some of us are more interested in making something to advance humanity than something likely to make a profit, even if we might look silly in the process. reply",

You don't need to host copyrighted material. It's all about intent . The Pirate Bay is (imo correctly, even if I disagree with other aspects about copyright law and its enforcement) seen as a place where people go to find ways to not pay authors for their content. They never hosted a copyrighted byte but they're banned in some form (DNS, IP, domain seizures) in many countries. Proxies of TPB also, so being like an ISP for such a site is already enough, whereas nobody is ordering blocks of Comcast's IP addresses for providing access to websites with copyrighted material because they didn't have a somewhat-provable intent to provide copyright infringement When I read the OP, I imagine this would link from the search results directly to Anna's archive and sci-hub, but I think you'd have to spin it as a general purpose search page and ideally not even mention AA was one of the sources, much less have links (Don't get me wrong: everyone wants this except the lobby of journals that presently own the rights) It would be a real shame if an anonymous third party that's definitely not the website operator made a Firefox add-on that illegitimately inserts these links to search results page though reply",

Making it do that does require stupid amounts of data and tons of compute in training. Currently, there's no better way, and the only alternative system with similar capabilities are... humans. IOW, it's not even an apples to oranges comparison, it's apples to gourmet chef. reply",

It can be roughly translated to \"you don't understand, it's a completely different situation\". That's what's constantly on my mind when I'm reading discussions like this one. Everybody and their dog torrenting petabytes of data and getting away with it (Meta is the only one that got caught and they've still gotten away with doing it)? The very same data poor American students were forced to commit suicide over? The same data that average American housewives were sued over for millions of dollars of \"damages\"? The same data that often gets random German plumbers or steelworkers to pay thousands of euros of \"fines\" to the copyright mafia so they won't get sued and have their lives ruined? Yet when giant corporations are doing the exact same thing on a massive scale, it's fine? It's not even the same thing, an American student torrenting books isn't making any money off it, while Meta very much is. Of course it's not the same, a simple-minded and poorly educated person like me isn't capable of understanding the difference.

Honestly was too tired to point that out in my earlier reply, but that's exactly the kind of argument you get when people are not willing (or purposefully refusing) to consider details. Intentionally or not, you get bogus and highly manipulative statements. A single case of a student activist fighting for freedom of communication and access to public goods for citizens, ending up breaking under pressure from public/non-profit institutions MIT, JSTOR, FBI over copyright, is not the same as what GP implied - many students, regular folks just like you and me, being forced to take their own lives due to legal consequences of pirating books in bulk. Nothing like the latter ever happened anyway. We can do better than this. (And even if we can't, I trust the courts can.) -- [0] - Curiously, while doing some search now to be sure I didn't miss any similar case, I learned that JSTOR incident wasn't the first for 'aaronsw - apparently, he did the same thing a few years earlier with public court documents[1]; FBI investigated this too, and concluded he was legally in the clear. It's probably well-known to everyone here, but I somehow missed it, so #TodayILearned.

They used their infinite VC money supply to interfere with and delay investigations and enforcement, betting that if they do it fast enough, they'll have the general population on their side. LLM vendors found and exploited[0] a legal uncertainty - correct me if I'm wrong, but AFAIK it still isn't settled whether or not their actions were actually illegal. Unlike Uber, LLM vendors aren't breaking into markets by ignoring the laws to outcompete incumbents, and burning stupid amounts of money just to get away with it. On the contrary, LLM vendors are simply providing an actually useful product, and charging a reasonable price for it, while reinvesting it into improving the product. Effects it has on other markets aside[1], their business model is just providing actual value in exchange for money. That's much more direct and honest than most of the tech industry . The product itself is also different. Uber is selling a mirage, a \"miracle\" improvement that quickly turns not so, and is destined to eventually destroy the markets it disrupted. LLM vendors are developing and serving systems that provide actual value to users, directly and obviously so. -- [0] - Probably walked into this without initially realizing it. No one complained 5-10 years ago, where the datasets were smaller and the resulting models had no real-world utility. It's only when the models became useful, that some people started looking for ways to make them go away.

Here's the link to the text of H.R. 1 on GovTrack: https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr1/text We automatically add links to U.S. Code and other citations. In this case Congress.gov is missing rich formatting which we have (I'm not sure why they are missing it for this bill, normally they have it). GovTrack also allows making diff-like comparisons between bill versions and between bills (for example, you can see the last-minute changes made ahead of the vote on this bill). Source code is available on GitHub if anyone wants to try making GovTrack better, although it's quite complicated because Congressional information is complicated and there's no real money behind this: https://github.com/govtrack/govtrack.us-web/ If anyone has particular thoughts on what would be helpful when viewing bill text --- within the realm of the information that is actually freely available --- I am all ears. reply",

In the last 15 years, efforts to make Congress publish more and better-structured information have been relatively bipartisan and, mostly, led by nonpolitical staff. I would not describe Democrats as having been the ones to have exclusively created the access to congressional information that we have today, although Democrats in recent years have led on government transparency and accountability issues generally, beyond the Legislative Branch.

          "text": "I've been building real-time collaboration into Obsidian (plugin is called Relay [0]) with the intent of integrating AI via standard collaboration flows. We haven't released our AI stuff yet, but have done several experiments and it is looking really promising. I'm also a heavy Zed user. A bunch of the UI (pre-Agent-overhaul) has been inspiring our work. I've also experimented with voice recordings when on the go, and low friction transcription has felt like one of the killer apps. One cool thing our plugin supports out of the box is using the voice input on Android for real time text-to-speech on Desktop (just have the note open on both devices). I've also enjoyed using a script [1] I wrote to summarize bash history each day into my daily note. It feels like there is a real spark in the Obsidian ecosystem right now. Super fun time to be building! [0] https://relay.md [1] https://notes.danielgk.com/Software/obsidian-import reply",

Creating commits could be (semi) automated with a script that takes a git-diff and ask a local (or cheap) LLM to create logical commits with a reasonable commit message. The script could run on file save or periodically. Mobile editing would be worse than Obsidian's iOS app. Workingcopy.app could provide an inferior but working UX. Thinking in progress :D reply",

To buy (and keep) one, you have to be rich enough that a couple months' rent is nothing, self-confident (or socially oblivious) enough that you don't mind looking like a Star Wars droid knock-off, and masochistic enough to want to take your neck to the gym every time you want to watch a movie. Not a very big target audience... It's too heavy and limited to be a useful personal screen. It's useless for gaming. It's too expensive to be an occasional-use-only device. It's a solution to a problem nobody had, and it solves none of the problems people do have. Sure, it had a lot of fancy tech, and maybe made sense as a laboratory prototype, but not a consumer device. You can do more with the $300 Facebook goggles for 10% of the price, or get one of the pricier but slimmer AR glasses (Xreal, etc.) reply",

          "text": "> But to be fair similar-style criticisms were levied against the iPhone Really? That was a long time ago, but I don't remember that sort of criticism towards the iPhone... though maybe my memory is just foggy? It seemed to all happen so quick, with Google copying them with the G1 soon afterward, and then... well, the rest is history. The iPhone was a streamlined evolution of an existing niche (PalmPilots, Blackberries, Nokia Communicator, etc.). When I first heard about the Vision Pro, I really hoped that they made a much simpler, slimmed-down version of the Oculus, something more like the Xreal glasses. I was surprised when they went the other way instead, doubling down on all the extra-fancy tech that just added more bulk and expense. I don't think anyone ever thought, \"Man, the thing VR really needs? A scary recording of my eyes on the front.\" They somehow managed to find the nightmarish \"sweet spot\" between dorkiness and the uncanny valley, and then jacked up the price 3x-10x compared to all the other VR headsets... On the other hand, I do remember similar criticisms towards the first iPod, famously compared to the Nomad and other MP3 players of that time ( https://slashdot.org/story/01/10/23/1816257/apple-releases-i... )... is that what you're referring to? reply",

          "text": "$3000 for what? That seems high outside of in-demand urban areas. In the rural parts of Oregon and California where I've lived, $2000 would get you a nice house with 2 or 3 bedrooms, and $1750 would get you a studio or 1 bedroom pretty easily. It just depends. As a single dude, I don't think I've ever paid $3000 for rent, anywhere I've lived, urban or rural. I think $2200 was the max and that was for a nicer short term rental.

So to me \"rent\" has always been \"cheap small apartment in a relatively safe but not luxurious part of town\". It's all relative :) Even now, with a steady partner, both mid-career and in our late 30s/early 40s, we can only afford to rent one half of a duplex (for about $2000). That gets us 2bd/2ba next to a nice little hiking spot though, so we feel quite lucky! It's a very different life than the millionaire FAANG folks live, I assume. We barely scrape by month to month, but we're content and grateful for what we do have :) Just means no Vision Pro in our futures, lol. But if someone comes out with a good $300-$500ish wearable virtual monitor, I'd love that. Curious about the Xreals... reply",

It doesn't have to be Stone Mountain (Tucker, Decatur, etc are all adjacent) and fine areas. There's not a huge number, but I see some: $1600 / month (3bd 2ba ~1400sqft) https://www.trulia.com/home/5449-pepperwood-ct-stone-mountai... $1400 / month (3bd 3ba ~1400sqft) https://www.trulia.com/home/640-woodcrest-manor-dr-stone-mou... $1600 / month (3bd, 2ba, ~1100sqft) https://www.trulia.com/home/1616-w-austin-rd-decatur-ga-3003... So it is very doable in Southeast US. I'm not sure where you live where the average rent is $2400 for a similarly sized 2-3 bedroom house, but if you work remotely - it's trivial to find significantly cheaper rents. I live in a fairly urbanized walkable city so I haven't rented a house in a while. Here $3k / month would get you a pretty posh pad, but it's far more than I spend on my flat. reply",

There are VR things but I wouldn't consider VR video games a mainstream set of people. Mainstream to me is smartphones, AI usage, etc. things that catch on with the majority of the population. I think that anything that is going to require humans to wear something on their head for entertainment purposes is not going to make it to mainstream. There will be niche uses and likely video games are a good niche. What is going to compel people to buy something like the Vision Pro when they already have smart phones that can do everything anyways? Also, humans over 40 tend to start needing reading glasses and with each year of age more and more people need them. Its hard to have any device that covers the eyes also take into account people's vision issues, minor or major. reply",

The headline will not be about doing a-previously-undoable-x. Vision Pro does not facilitate teamwork and teamwork is how approximately all important things get done. Not solipsistically.  I mean visualize a conversation through Vision Pro versus one using Facetime or zoom. You lose most non-verbal communication if you leave the goggles on. Zoom and Facetime and even POTS and faxes are what successful virtual reality looks like, they collapse real space — collapse distances —- between people. reply",

I work with a company who builds interactive educational experiences in VR and even they can't use it because it can't do basic things like accurately keep track of hand positioning or gestures (beyond pitch). Really the only use case for it is as a media device, but the price is way too high to buy it for that alone. If the hope was that businesses and developers were going to buy one and start developing an ecosystem around it then they probably should have made it more than a glorified 3D TV, or made it much cheaper so it was more widely accessible. I hear there's rumours they're going to add handsets soon though, so if they can do that while also bringing the price down a little that might help adoption a bit. reply",

          "text": "Your question is \"Is there any demand for Personal CV/Resume website?\". The short answer is: There is demand for employment . What problem are you actually trying to solve? If you were looking for a job, would writing a résumé be the biggest hurdle for you? People write CVs to apply for jobs, and they apply for jobs to work, and they work to have an income which they use to go on about life. Now, what we have here is selling soap to hungry people who are broke. A CV builder is like soap in a restaurant; it is important to wash your hands at a restaurant, but you don't go to a restaurant to wash your hands. It can be a hook to do other things, like discover your customers, etc. but your would be users eventually come to you to get a job. How do you get them there? What are the sides of this market? You have a distribution problem. Ideally, anyone who uses your CV builder gets employed. Which means they get hired. Which means there's an employer on the other side who received that CV. How do you plug in that process? Maybe go upstream and do some fine targeting, maybe a choice of the point of market entry: start with people who are looking for their first job and who've never had a CV. You shouldn't wait for them to find you; they may not even be aware they need a CV. Maybe you can start with employment agencies where you live. Many countries have agencies where unemployed people register to get notified when a job matching their skills is available. Maybe going to high-schools or colleges and getting your users there, on the spot, helping them making a CV. Maybe fine-tune where you plug in that value chain: the builder is just to get the data in order to make recommendations to jobs that match their skills that they weren't even aware existed. Get to know who you're serving and what serving them is about. This response is about the feasibility of this, not about its viability as a business or if it is worth your while. reply",

This was fairly easy to accomplish on a QMK firmware keyboard (I was also already typing on a split keyboard so that might be part of the reason it was fairly easy to adjust).

This may be what you are referring to. I haven't tried it much but those layouts could be a temporary solution. I found Qwerty to be a lot easier to type one handed straight up because Dvorak tries to alternate hands between keys. I recently discovered Talon, an open source app for voice control of basically everything on a machine that requires no typing at all. I saw some people are using it even if they can use their hands, as a power tool. It appears to be fully Python scriptable and also gives you some nice speech to text abilities too. It allows you to specify a bunch of keywords for typing symbols and it looks like some people can do full coding quite quickly. Perhaps this injury could be an opportunity to try something like this and become more powerful than before? Best of luck and recovery to your friend. https://talonvoice.com/ reply",

But, I only needed it for a couple months. Like OP's relative, I also could not use my dominant arm, nor have my arm in a position that would allow typing one handed on a regular keyboard.  The twiddler was the only commercially available option that I was able to find that would allow me to type in this state.  So, another recommendation of twiddler, but with the caveat that the original had several warts, and while they appear to be redesigned, they may still suffer from some of them. The velcro strap to hold it to the hand, combined with the shape of the keyboard, allowed it to shift position while typing making it harder to use.  Photos of the current models show they have a different shape now.  Maybe this is less of a problem now?  They are also wireless now, so there isn't a wire constantly pulling it out of position whenever you move. The keyboard markings rubbed off completely after only a few weeks of use on my OG twiddler.  Hopefully they have worked that manufacturing issue out for the current models. reply",

Many people provide a rough spec, then either (shutter) vibe-code or edit substantially once it produces it. Having a RSI myself, I find that I can provide very detailed instructions in regular english, for which voice dictation works quite well to Cursor (but any others should work too), then it will produce code that I have to edit very little.  For most people this wouldn't be an efficient flow, but it greatly helps me reduce typing, thus is beneficial to me. With something like that, I believe you could do well pecking around with one hand for edits without needing to do much typing. On Mac, Karabiner-Elements is incredibly useful to remap things, such that you can enable things like mousekeys or otherwise that would keep from having to move (either) hand very much.  It's also a way to do as others have shown on this post and do a mirror layout or add something analogous to layers without having to buy new keyboards. reply",

          "text": "There is Edgar Matias's \"Half Keyboard\" layout, where the right hand's keys of a regular keyboard are mirrored on the left hand when holding a modifier key with your thumb.\nThe idea is that if you have learned touch-typing then muscle memory for the right hand should be available also on the left. Matias wrote an article [1] about it and then made it into a commercial product [2], but the concept should be possible on any programmable keyboard.\nPerhaps it would be possible with a AutoHotkey (MS-Windows) or Karabiner (MacOS) script otherwise. There is a large scene for more-or-less DIY \"ergonomic\" mechanical programmable keyboards with various different physical layouts, but common themes are 1) that they are split in a pair of two physical keyboards and 2) that they have multiple thumb-keys for modifiers / Return / Space. You could build and program just one half of such a pair.\nMany years ago I programmed an ErgoDox with the HalfKeyboard layout, just to try it out, and that ErgoDox I had built on a budget from mostly salvaged vintage components.

My 2 cents would be to try out a few existing possibilities before investing heavily on alternates.

I'm either that clumsy or those were freak incidents...)) and none that were created / acquired to help me out during those restricted movement periods have stayed with me...

          "text": "The best solution for me was to type with the left hand and switch from a mouse to a Logitech MX Ergo thumb-trackball — the key advantage is it can sit inside the sling and instantly give me full functionality. My use case was shoulder surgery that kept my dominant right hand in a sling for two+ months, but I could use my fingers after a week or so, and much of my work is CAD. It took only a few hours to completely get used to it, and I never went back to a mouse. While left-hand-only typing speed obviously went down, this was significantly mitigated by having a full function point-&-click device. It turns out this setup is also really helpful when working in tight spaces where a mouse is near-impossible, such as airplanes or tight luncheon booths. Even typing emails and multi-page documents left-handed was tolerable for 10 weeks, but if it had been longer, I probably would have looked into a chorded one-handed keyboard solution, as the learning cost would have been worth it. I hope this helps, and good on you for helping your friend, and I hope they get well fast! reply",

Honestly, if you aren't used to one handed typing its not worth the time to train to get good at it(I'm assuming they're right hand dominant) its all just muscle memory. If they can pick it up quickly go for it, keyboard bindings, or something like predictive text assistance, or even vim-like remappings are an interesting idea. IMO - if possible just peck-type(like an old lady who is learning to use a keyboard) or use text to speech/AI & editing where possible - like in emails. They shouldn't be using the left arm/hand much right after surgery anyway. If they're programming definitely not as easy but still doable. reply",

I figured the time was short enough that I would just use a regular keyboard, one handed, and live with the slowdown. It was annoying, certainly, and while I did get faster typing only with my left hand, I of course never got close to full speed. But it was fine, I survived, and I don't think it would have been worth spending the money, as well as the time to learn a new keyboard setup. Remember that a one-handed keyboard (or some other arrangement) isn't going to bring you back up to full speed immediately. It's probably going to take a few weeks to learn, and you might not even get back up to full speed at all. reply",

Dasher is fantastic, because it's based on rock solid information theory, designed by the late David MacKay. Here is the seminal Google Tech Talk about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpOxbesRNBc Here is a demo of using Dasher by an engineer at Google, Ada Majorek, who has ALS and uses Dasher and a Headmouse to program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvHQ83pMLQQ Another one of her demonstrating Dasher: Ada Majorek Introduction - CSUN Dasher https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvsSrClBwPM Here’s a more recent presentation about it, that tells all about the latest open source release of Dasher 5: Dasher - CSUN 2016 - Ada Majorek and Raquel Romano https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFlkM_e-sDg Here's the github repo: Dasher Version 4.11 https://github.com/GNOME/dasher >Dasher is a zooming predictive text entry system, designed for situations where keyboard input is impractical (for instance, accessibility or PDAs). It is usable with highly limited amounts of physical input while still allowing high rates of text entry. Ada referred me to this mind bending prototype: D@sher Prototype - An adaptive, hierarchical radial menu. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oSfEM8XpH4 >( http://www.inference.org.uk/dasher ) - a really neat way to \"dive\" through a menu hierarchy/, or through recursively nested options (to build words, letter by letter, swiftly). D@sher takes Dasher, and gives it a twist, making slightly better use of screen revenue. >It also \"learns\" your typical useage, making more frequently selected options larger than sibling options. This makes it faster to use, each time you use it. >More information here: http://beznesstime.blogspot.com and here: https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=960 Dasher is even a viable way to input text in VR, just by pointing your head, without a special input device! Text Input with Oculus Rift: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQgluUwV2U >As part of VR development environment I'm currently writing ( https://github.com/xanxys/construct ), I've implemented dasher ( http://www.inference.org.uk/dasher ) to input text. One important property of Dasher is that you can pre-train it on a corpus of typical text, and dynamically train it while you use it. It learns the patterns of letters and words you use often, and those become bigger and bigger targets that string together so you can select them even more quickly! Ada Majorek has it configured to toggle between English and her native language so she can switch between writing email to her family abroad and co-workers at google. Now think of what you could do with a version of dasher integrated with a programmer's IDE, that knew the syntax of the programming language you're using, as well as the names of all the variables and functions in scope, plus how often they're used! I have a long term pie in the sky “grand plan” about developing a JavaScript based programmable accessibility system I call “aQuery”, like “jQuery” for accessibility. It would be a great way to deeply integrate Dasher with different input devices and applications across platforms, and make them accessible to people with limited motion, as well as users of VR and AR and mobile devices. https://web.archive.org/web/20180826132551/http://donhopkins...

          "text": "You're proving exactly why I posted what I did. Nobody else has the time to watch a couple of 45 minute videos (several hours actually), so I took the time to do that myself (several more videos about Dasher than those, in fact), and summarize them for you. I've had email discussions about Dasher with people I mentioned like Ada Majorek (Google), also David Ward (Inference, who worked with the late David MacKay), Tom Doellstorff (UC Irvine), Donna Z. Davis (University of Oregon), and I've read several papers about it, and also the open source code on github, to understand how it works. So I took the time to summarize the points in the videos, the email discussions I've had, the papers I read, and source code I reviewed. https://www.inference.org.uk/djw30/ There are many interesting points and ideas I've tried to gather together and summarize, and I think Dasher is an important, underrated, not widely known piece of work, that can deeply improve many people's lives, which more people should know about. Not just people with a wide range of disabilities, but fully abled people without free time on their hands who frequently need to input lots of text quickly. That's why accessibility, diversity, equity, and inclusion are so important: they help everyone. Dasher a wonderful open source project to contribute to, and a solid foundation that needs to be brought up-to-date and re-implement it in terms of modern LLMs, AI assisted IDEs like Cursor, mobile, and VR/AR user interfaces. I don't have time to do all of that myself, but I hope to save other people time and effort by writing about it, and I hope to inspire students, researchers, software developers, hackers, and therapists who do have the time, interest, friends, loved ones, patients, and customers who could benefit from it. I'm sorry to hear about your disabilities of poor reading comprehension and trouble parsing text, and I'm envious that you have so much free time and nothing better to do, that you can take time to complain about your impatience with and intolerance of my writing. But it would have been easier, more efficient, and less stressful for you to simply ignore things you're not interested in rather than unconstructively whining with off-topic posts that benefit nobody. Obviously you don't appreciate how lucky you are to be able to type such a useless post so easily. I'm not even asking you to be empathic, or give a shit about anyone but yourself: if you're lucky enough to live long enough, you'll need accessibility tools like Dasher too. If you'd like to redeem yourself by writing a more useful constructive response to my post, then go right ahead, read my previous posts, watch all the videos, read all the papers and source code yourself, have some email discussions with other people using and working on Dasher, and then try to write a better summary, because your abstract summary above has absolutely no useful information, and isn't relevant to the discussion -- just a waste of your time and everyone else's. Or you could even take the trivial effort to paste my write-up into ChatGPT and post a summary, but that would be much lower quality and less enlightening than actually watching the videos and reading the articles and source code I cited yourself, but still better and more interesting than your current bitter off-topic \"contribution\" to the discussion. If it makes you feel better, I've written every word of this post personally just for you, MyPasswordSucks. No copying or pasting whatsoever (except the email at the end, with updated links to archive.org since my web site is offline, and I reformatted the transcript of Ada's video). Are you satisfied? Is that the attention you crave? Are my syntax and semantics comprehensible to you now? In return, what do you have to contribute to this discussion yourself, besides whining and criticizing form instead of substance? At least aaron695's rightfully flagged dead sibling comment unsuccessfully and incoherently attempted to criticize dasher itself, not just the messenger, so it was at least more on topic than you post. I hope you can do better. Here's the email I sent and the response that Ada Majorek wrote to me, using Dasher and headmouse. Since she was so swamped with work at Google, and it took her so much time and effort, even with Dasher, for her to reply to my email because she has ALS, I cherish her helpful reply, and I am glad you reminded me to share it, even if it annoys you to read so much thoughtful meticulously written text that she took the precious time out of her challenging life to write to me: ---- Hello! I’ve been a huge fan of Dasher for years! I'm sad to hear that David MacKay passed away. I knew of his work on Dasher, but am just discovering his great work on global warming. I’m happy to discover how Ada Majorek is carrying on his work, and that Dasher version 5 has been released! I developed and evaluated pie menus in the late 80’s and have used them in various games and applications, and more recently I’ve been doing mobile and VR programming with Unity3D. I’m interested in helping develop versions of Dasher on other platforms, especially Unity, and specifically for head mounted displays. Is anyone else working on that, with whom I could collaborate? I have a long term pie in the sky “grand plan” about developing a JavaScript based programmable accessibility system I call “aQuery”, like “jQuery” for accessibility. It would be a great way to deeply integrate Dasher with different input devices and applications across platforms, and make them accessible to people with limited motion, as well as users of VR and AR and mobile devices. https://web.archive.org/web/20180826132551/http://donhopkins... I’d be delighted to discuss Dasher and aQuery with anyone who’s interested! Here’s some discussion on hacker news, to which I contributed some comments about Dasher: A History of Palm, Part 1: Before the PalmPilot (lowendmac.com) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12306377 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12310029 -Don ---- Hi Don, I will write more soon. I was swamped with work last week. First, I am very happy to see your interest in Dasher.\nI don't have enough time to research another platform. I will be happy to give you walk through the code, and you can decide, if adding Unity is feasible. Is it possible to interface with C++ code on Uniy? There is Dasher Core. It is platform independent. And \"all\" you need to do is to extend several classes. Implementing it in Java Script is an interesting idea. You are second person suggesting it. Again, I will not have time to do it. But would gladly answer any questions. When you wrote about radial menus, I immediately thought of this prototype. Have you seen it before? D@sher Prototype - An adaptive, hierarchical radial menu: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oSfEM8XpH4 I better send half of the email now, than full email never ;-) Written with Dasher and Headmouse. :-) Ada ---- Thank you for your quick reply — I’m delighted to hear from you! Yes, it’s possible to interface native C++ code with Unity. It would also be possible to translate the C++ code to C#, which is a similar language (just cleaner and more modern). It’s also possible to compile C++ into JavaScript, but that makes it considerably harder to integrate with normal JavaScript code, so it might also be worth considering translating the C++ code to JavaScript by hand, to make it more efficient and better integrated with the browser. That adaptive hierarchical radial menu is wonderful! Thank you for linking me to that. I’ll contact the author and brainstorm ideas! That reminds me of a weird experiment I tried years ago: Here is a “precision pie menu” that I made for the NeWS window system, which lets you precisely select an angle by poking out of the circle and precisely dialing in an exact number with a flexible floppy line. I’ve never used it for anything practical, but it was a fun experiment! Precision Pie Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0scs59va4c Experiments like that are useful vehicles for exploring possibilities and generating new ideas, even if they aren’t directly useful themselves. You just can’t get very far by doing though experiments alone — you need to play with a working prototype and actually feel how it works, in order to decide how to improve it or design something different. It’s so cool you’re using Dasher and a Headmouse for everyday work, and that gives you so much experience and insight into how to use it best and make it better. So please don’t hesitate to send me half emails and half baked ideas, even if you don’t have the time to finish them! -Don ---- Ada Majorek on Dasher: [I reformatted her inspiring transcript, for people who don't have time to watch the three minute video, although it's well worth it to see how Dasher works.] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvHQ83pMLQQ ALS robbed me from ability to speak and ability to use computer keyboard. Thanks to Dasher I am still able to communicate at reasonable speed. Hi, my name is Ada. I want to talk about why I like Dasher. Since my ALS diagnosis in 2013 I tried countless number of alternative text entry and speech generation methods. So far Dasher is the fastest and least tiring. Dasher supports multiple languages. Very important for me, since I switch between English and Polish many times per day. I really like geeky origin of Dasher. It started as a visualization of arithmetic coding algorithm. Unfortunately at the time Dasher was not actively maintained. I was a software engineer in desperate need for a fast alternative communication tool. Dasher was an open-source project. I decided to start coding. With help of my friends and support of Google, we added many features making Dasher even better suited for alternative means of communication. And here we are today after almost 6 years of silence we are releasing a new version of Dasher: Dasher 5.00. If you know people with motor impairments or therapists, please let them know. They will like new features we have added. If you know programming, consider contributing to this very valuable project. And last but not least, if you worked on Dasher in the past, thank you very much from the bottom of my heart. reply",

CNN's John Berman reports Here's a low-effort ChatGPT generated TL;DR summary, to satisfy MyPasswordSucks who had trouble reading my other post: Here’s the straight-up rundown of the Dasher thread: DonHopkins jumped in to rave about Dasher—calling it a miracle for people who can’t type. He dropped links to videos, papers, GitHub, and even shared his personal emails with Ada Majorek, who uses Dasher because ALS stole her voice and hands. He made it clear he’d dug deep—watched hours of videos, pored over source code, talked to experts. He went all in to explain why Dasher deserves more love: it’s based on solid info theory, it learns your patterns, it’s openly extensible, and it works across languages and platforms—even VR. Someone named novosel chimed in asking why Don’s comment was downvoted, saying Dasher really is worth knowing. But then MyPasswordSucks blasted it as “barely-parsable copy-paste diarrhea” and declared Dasher awful, claiming the whole thing was off-topic. He sneered at Don’s effort, calling it useless. aaron695 piled on, arguing Dasher isn’t the answer for someone with a short-term injury and criticizing Don’s wall of text even more harshly. DonHopkins didn’t back down. He defended his post, pointed out how much final work he put in—no copying or pasting. He reminded people Ada had replied personally, highlighting how essential Dasher is for her. He got indignant about people whining instead of appreciating the depth of his write-up. In short, DonHopkins delivered a massive, heartfelt case for Dasher. Critics flamed him for style and focus. The result: a messy, heated debate between someone who’s poured years into accessibility work and anonymous commenters who can’t be bothered to look beyond a giant block of text. reply",

          "text": "What's magnificent about Dasher is that it works with so many modalities, like eye tracking, suck tube, pressing a single button and waiting, etc. It's able to extract the maximum number of bits of text per minute from the minimum amount of bits of input per minute, harnessing every input device to its fullest potential. It also seamlessly supports multiple languages, it can be pre-trained on examples of what you write so it adapts to your vocabulary and gives your favorite words more shelf space on the Library of Babel, and you can include symbols and control functions too. You could even have an \"emoji\" branch where you spell out the :smile: codes, constrained to just the defined codes so it's easier to select them (and see the growing emojis as you get near to spelling them out all the way), incrementally learning your favorites and making them easier to pick. It drives me nuts how we blindly accept these ancient, kludgy input methods -- QWERTY is the biggest offender, but let’s not forget those shitty swipe keyboards that think gliding your thumb over letters is somehow “intuitive,” or the garbled cell-phone autocomplete systems that keep mangling your sentences until they’re barely recognizable, then texting embarrassing obscenities to your mom. Dasher is in a league of its own. Instead of shoving you into a historically fixed grid of scrambled letters, or forcing you to hunt and peck through a list of predicted but unpredictable words, Dasher treats writing as a continuous journey through a probability landscape! You don’t tap tiny squares or hope the AI guesses what you meant, you literally “dive” into the next letter or word that’s statistically most likely. Maximum text output for minimum physical effort, without any of the guesswork or awkward ergonomics baked into hunt-n-pecking QWERTY, slippery swipe tricks, or psychotic autocomplete engines. reply",

          "text": "I am fascinated by the idea of building something like the Lisp Machines or Smalltalk 80 from scratch. Build a Forth in assembly, build a Lisp in Forth, build an OS and computing environment in Lisp. AOT-compile only the Forth interpreter, load and compile the rest from source during system boot, maybe with later stages optimizing the previous stages as the system is assembling itself. I imagine two languages - Langsam and Schnell - intertwined in some sort of yin-yang fashion. Langsam is slow, dynamic, interpreted, Schnell is fast, static, compiled. Both would be LISPs. Schnell would be implemented as a library in Langsam. If you said (define (add x y) (+ x y)) in Langsam, you would get a Langsam function. If you said (s:define (add (x int) (y int)) (+ x y)) in Langsam, you would get a Langsam function which is a wrapper over a JIT-compiled Schnell function. If you invoke it, the wrapper takes care of the FFI, execution happens at C speed. Most of the complexity typical of a low-level compiled language could be moved into Langsam. I could have sophisticated type systems and C++ template like code generation implemented in a comfortable high level language. This latter part I managed to partially implement in Clojure and it works (via LLVM), it would be just too much effort to get it completed. reply",

Plan to fry sensors and IC's. Also helps to read some basic electrical theory and know what the role of different components are. The way I got proficient is with hobbyist PCB design. What helped me is starting with schematics and datasheets and planning to finish with an assembled board. I started designing PCB's and having them assembled with JLCPCB (quite cheap: $20 or so for a run of 5 boards; $120-$150 fully assembled). I fried 2 boards before the 3rd rev booted up, then from there it's optimization. I consider the $200/mo or so in PCBA, whether boards work or not, to be my \"EE education\" -- cost efficient compared to university fees! And $200 is sort of like the \"exam,\" it's costly enough to make me really think twice about component selection/placement/etc. Not saying that's the approach you want to take because that might be hardcore / not someplace you want to get to. But I spent a long long time really wondering how electricity really works and like why you need capacitors, inductors, op-amps, etc. It never made sense to me until I created my own schematic, chose my own parts, and understood why I chose the parts I did and connected them the way I did. reply",

Don't order assembled boards when you are starting. Order cheapest bluepill (STM32F103C8T6) or non-original arduino clone and start on breadboard with that. Make pcb's only when you're ready to learn more. Expect that your first one will not work or will require some \"rewiring\", but second one may already work. You might start with some cheap through-hole components, they are a little easier to re-wire or re-solder, it's a good idea to put your first microcontroller in socket. reply",

EE is a very mature field and it's very math heavy for a reason. The second you move past the hobby boards, stuff becomes really difficult and really expensive really fast. If your end goal is to create toys for kids, then it's fine as a hobby. But without the formal training and lab access you are going to struggle to get past that point so it's pretty much impossible to turn the hobby into something more. Unlike software, where tinkering genuinely has the possibility of turning your side projects into careers. Hell, if you don't live in EE hotspot locations, I wouldn't even recommend it as a career anymore. Software is where it's at, even in the age of AI. reply",

Now that I've put a disclaimer, here is what helped me the most: When you are shy, there is sometimes the one kind person that introduces you/breaks the ice to others. You love this person because they lubricated the social interaction. I harness this feeling of being saved by pretending that everyone around me is the shy person waiting for someone to break the ice. I frame this internally as myself doing the shy others a huge favor that they'll appreciate. I want to be \"that guy\" that helped people feel included and involved. I used to do this consciously. At this point, I rarely have to invoke this thought as I've now put in the reps and it's easier. Tldr: pretend you're being a social savior and repeated practice reply",

I'd like to go from indoor bouldering to rock climbing, but coordinating with a belayer doesn't seem super interesting and otherwise it's just a matter of expense, gear, and a slight pivot in my leisure time to start going at it. Otherwise, the skill that seems most out of reach is keeping a job for longer than a year. I'm in a decent spot now, after a year and a half prior of being unemployed, and I feel like this might be my last real shot at a career of any kind. Other people seem to handle it fine, but this is the thing that seems most out of reach. Unlike engineering problems that are made up of abstractions with ways to break them down and piece together systems, keeping a job is as opaque of an abstraction as I'm aware of, that doesn't necessarily depend on a measurable skill or even on anything within one's control. I've never once felt stability or been able to bet on money coming in next year, and if I had the money for a mortgage, I'd be stopped by the knowledge I can't count on an income flow at any time in the future. I'm thankful for what I have and what I've learned nonetheless. reply",

This assumes you live in an area with some outdoor climbing. Outdoor bouldering can be done with little equipment, but you need to start way easier than what you'd do at the wall. The ground is surprisingly hard and I've seen someone break their ankle right in front of me a few times and it does not look fun. Outdoor sport climbing is pretty easy to get into if you have bolted climbing in your area, but as you get higher the ground gets even harder so make sure you know what you're doing. Lots of good books and resources available. If you really want to get into trad climbing be prepared for a longer apprenticeship, take your time and start easy. reply",

Start by talking to people at your bouldering gym. If you hear anyone discussing going out climbing, ask if you can tag along and just watch for a few times. Watch some videos about climbing basics to get an overall feel for it and some of the concepts and terminology. I'd say you should start out \"top roping\" on smaller walls. As for equipment for that you don't need much especially since your partner will probably have a rope and gear to build an anchor, etc. You'll need, shoes, a harness, and a helmet. Going from gym bouldering to outdoor climbing _does_ require being a little more social. It's a minimum 2-person sport usually. But going as a small group and rotating roles and just hanging out watching works too.) You just need to find people you like hanging out with and you can trust. (If you don't find them at your gym, try another or ask around at outdoor stores, your local university rec department, etc.) About jobs, I can't help you.

Sure, you should understand Ohm's law and what basic components (resistors, capacitors, transistors) do , but you can jump from that right into understanding how a battery charger works without having to understand how the components actually work. The hard part is finding good tutorial material that starts at the right level: most of the professionally written stuff presupposes that you're either already an EE, or have one at your disposal to translate things for you. reply",

When I was deep into neural nets in the 1990s, they weren't that large, and I would think of them in terms of the number of weights and nodes - but modern deep learning seems to have has moved up a few levels of abstraction. (I stepped away from the field for a while).  And there's a certain understanding people seem to have now regarding the \"gradient flow\" through the net and why certain architectures work well (Resnet, Unets etc).

          "text": "Well, I'm have a little guilty bias towards spacetime non-substantivalism and I've always been interested in getting back to physics in this area. I've particularly found the Shape Dynamics program to be at least somewhat interesting and while I have a sort of ok grasp of the language and mathematics of GR translating that to the SD world has been a persistent challenge. If I had time I'd try to figure that out. Briefly, one usually formulates the theory of gravity in terms of a a 4d spacetime with curvature but you can also formulate it as a theory of curved 3d shapes if you allow the lagrangian to carry more structure. This is often performed in GR, in fact, by decomposing the metric into a \"spatial\" and \"temporal\" part but shape dynamics kind of runs with this idea in an attempt to formulate a totally relational version of the theory of gravity. Shape Dynamics apparently produces a reasonable theory of gravity which agrees with GR in many situations but forbids, I believe, closed timelike curves, and may be more amenable to quantization since it re-separates space and time. Anyway, it all seems very beyond me, maybe even if I had the time, which I do not. reply",

          "text": "Have you tried 3D printing? It’s a pretty cheap and forgiving way to get into manufacturing. You’ll get a lot of practice with CAD. Autodesk Fusion 360 is free for hobby use and very good. For machining, I’d start with wood (wood lathe or router, cheaper than a real metal lathe or mill). Very similar concepts as real machining (feeds and speeds, toolpaths, CAM). Up to you if you want to start manual or CNC. The Shapeoko routers are very nice and relatively affordable (in this domain). You can also find used manual machines locally, but it’s hard to know if they’re in good condition if you don’t know anything. If you want to read, the Machinery’s Handbook, aka the Bible in any shop, is enormous and contains pretty much anything you’d want to know. Oh, and get a set of Mitutoyo digital calipers. Expensive but the only way to go, in my opinion. Measuring is fundamental to manufacturing. reply",

I want to do a couple of different things, and not sure if they all fit in one project or no: - implement a single line font in my current project: https://github.com/WillAdams/gcodepreview - implement a way to convert arbitrary curves into smooth arcs (for DXFs or G2/G3 arcs for G-code) - work up an interactive version of METAFONT/METAPOST which allows both programming and drawing reply",

          "text": "As a very early CUDA programmer who participated in the cudacontest from NVidia during 2008 and I believe one of the only entries (I'm not claiming though) to be submitted from India and got a consolation and participation prize of a BlackEdition Card, I can vouch the method which I followed. - Look up the CUDA Programming Guide from NVidia - CUDA Programming books from NVidia from developer.nvidia.com/cuda-books-archive link - Start creating small programs based on the existing implementations (A strong C implementation knowledge is required. So, brush up if needed.) - Install the required Toolchains, compilers, and I am assuming you have the necessary hardware to play around - Github links with CUDA projects. Read the code, And now you could use LLM to explain the code in the way you would need - Start creating smaller, yet parallel programs etc., etc., And in about a month or two, you should have enough to start writing CUDA programs. I'm not aware of the skill / experience levels you have, but whatever it might be, there are plenty of sources and resources available now than it was in 2007/08. Create a 6-8 weeks of study plan and you should be flying soon! Hope it helps. Feel free to comment and I can share whatever I could to guide. reply",

Older GPUs than Turing should be avoided, because they lack many capabilities of the newer cards, e.g. \"tensor cores\", and their support in the newer CUDA toolkits will be deprecated in a not very distant future, but very slowly, so for now you can still create programs for Maxwell GPUs from 10 years ago. Among the newer GPUs, the RTX 40xx SUPER series (i.e. the SUPER variants, not the original RTX 40xx series) has the best energy efficiency. The newest RTX 50xx GPUs have worse energy efficiency than RTX 40xx SUPER, so they achieve a somewhat higher performance only by consuming a disproportionately greater power. Instead of that, it is better to use multiple RTX 40xx SUPER. reply",

          "text": "I looked at the CUDA code for Leela Chess Zero and found it pretty understandable, though that was back when Leela used a DCNN instead of transformers.  DCNN's are fairly simple and are explained in fast.ai videos that I watched a few years ago, so navigating the Leela code wasn't too difficult.  Transformers are more complicated and I want to bone up on them, but I haven't managed to spend any time understanding them. CUDA itself is just a minor departure from C++, so the language itself is no big deal if you've used C++ before.  But, if you're trying to get hired programming CUDA, what that really means is they want you implementing AI stuff (unless it's game dev).  AI programming is a much wider and deeper subject than CUDA itself, so be ready to spend a bunch of time studying and hacking to come up to speed in that.  But if you do, you will be in high demand.  As mentioned, the fast.ai videos are a great introduction. In the case of games, that means 3D graphics which these days is another rabbit hole.  I knew a bit about this back in the day, but it is fantastically more sophisticated now and I don't have any idea where to even start. reply",

This is something that changes with times and trends. 2. Learning high-performance computing approaches. While a GPU and the Nvlink interfaces are Nvidia specific, working in a massively-parallel distributed computing environment is a general branch of knowledge that is translatable across HPC architectures. 3. Application specifics. If your thing is Transformers, you may just as well start from Torch, Tensorflow, etc. and rely on the current high-level abstractions, to inspire your learning down to the fundamentals. I’m no longer active in any of the above, so I can’t be more specific, but if you want to master CUDA, I would say learning how massive-parallel programming works, is the foundation that may translate into transferable skills. reply",

          "text": "I will give you personal experience learning CUDA that might be helpful. Disclaime: I don't claim that this is actually a systematic way to learn it and it is more for academic work. I got assigned to a project that needs learning CUDA as part of my PhD. There was no one in my research group who have any experience or know CUDA. I started with standard  NVIDIA courses (Getting Started with Accelerated Computing with CUDA C/C++ and there is python version too). This gave me good introduction to the concepts and basic ideas but I think after that I did most of learning by trial and error. I tried a couple of online tutorials for specific things and some books but it was always a deprecated function there or here or a change of API that make things obsolete. Or basically things changed for your GPU and now you have to be careful because yoy might be using GPU version not compatible with what I develop for in production and you need things to work for both. I think learning CUDA for me is an endeavor of pain and going through \"compute-sanitizer\" and Nsight because you will find that most of your time will go into debugging why things is running slower than you think. Take things slowly. Take a simple project that you know how to do without CUDA then port it to CUDA ane benchmark against CPU and try to optimize different aspect of it. The one advice that can be helpful is not to think about optimization at the beginning. Start with correct, then optimize.  A working slow kernel beats a fast kernel that corrupts memory. reply",

          "text": "I can share a similar PhD story (the result being visible here: https://github.com/NX-AI/flashrnn ). Back then I didn't find any tutorials that cover anything beyond the basics (which are still important).\nOnce you have understood the principle working mode and architecture of a GPU, I would recommend the following workflow:\n1. First create an environment so that you can actually test your kernels against baselines written in a higher-level language.\n2. If you don't have an urgent project already, try to improve/re-implement existing problems (MatMul being the first example). Don't get caught by wanting to implement all size cases. Take an example just to learn a certain functionality, rather than solving the whole problem if it's just about learning.\n3. Write the functionality you want to have in increasing complexity. Write loops first, then parallelize these loops over the grid. Use global memory first, then put things into shared memory and registers. Use plain matrix multiplication first, then use mma (TensorCore) primitives to speed things up.\n4. Iterate over the CUDA C Programming Guide. It covers all (most) of the functionality that you want to learn - but can't be just read an memorized. When you apply it you learn it.\n5. Might depend on you use-case but also consider using higher-level abstractions like CUTLASS or ThunderKitten. Also, if your environment is jax/torch, use triton first before going to CUDA level. Overall, it will be some pain for sure. And to master it including PTX etc. will take a lot of time. reply",

The skills are completely orthogonal. CUDA belongs to the domain of game developers, graphics people, high performance computing and computer engineers (hardware).

          "text": "I had a bit, limited, exposure to cuda. It was before the AI boom, during Covid. I found it easy to start. Then there was a pretty nice learning curve to get to warps, SM's and basic concepts. Then I was able to dig deeper into the integer opcodes, which was super cool. I was able to optimize the compute part pretty well, without much roadblocks. However, getting memory loads perfect and then getting closer to hw (warp groups, divergence, the L2 cache split thing, scheduling), was pretty hard. I'd say CUDA is pretty nice/fun to start with, and it's possible to get quite far for a novice programmer. However getting deeper and achieving real advantage over CPU is hard. Additionally there is a problem with Nvidia segmenting the market - some opcodes are present in _old_ gpu's (CUDA arch is _not_ forwards compatible). Some opcodes are reserved to \"AI\" chips (like H100). So, to get code that is fast on both H100 and RTX5090 is super hard. Add to that a fact that each card has different SM count and memory capacity and bandwidth... and you end up with an impossible compatibility matrix. TLDR: Beginnings are nice and fun. You can get quite far on the optimizing compute part. But getting compatibility for differnt chips and memory access is hard. When you start, chose specific problem, specific chip, specific instruction set. reply",

That doesn't mean one-eyed-king knowledge is never enough to solve that chicken-and-egg. You only have to be good enough to get the job. But if you haven't done it on the job, you don't have work experience and you are either lying to others or lying to yourself...and any sophisticated organization won't fall for it... ...except of course, knowingly. And the best way to get someone to knowingly ignore obvious dunning-kruger and/or horseshit is to know that someone personally or professionally. Which is to say that the best way to get a good job is to have a good relationship with someone who can hire you for a good job (nepotism trumps technical ability, always). And the best way to find a good job is to know a lot of people who want to work with you. To put it another way, looking for a job is the only way to find a job and looking for a job is also much much harder than everything that avoids looking for a job  (like studying CUDA) by pretending to be preparation...because again, studying CUDA won't ever give you professional experience. Don't get me wrong,  there's nothing wrong with learning CUDA all on your own. But it is not professional experience and it is not looking for a job doing CUDA. Finally, if you want to learn CUDA just learn it for its own sake without worrying about a job. Learning things for their own sake is the nature of learning once you get out of school.

          "text": "(I worked at a different processing company, which I am not speaking for.) We're struggling to find the motive or intended outcome by the attacker(s). The highest likelihood for me is that they're doing card/credential testing. They have either stolen or purchased a large number of stolen credentials. Those credentials are worth more individually if they are known to function. They can use any business on the Internet which sells anything and would tell someone \"Sorry, can't sell you that because I couldn't charge your account/card/etc. Do you have another one?\" to quickly winnow their set of credentials into a pile of ones which haven't been canceled yet and another pile. Another variation of this attack is their list is \"literally just enumerate all the cards possible in a range and try to sift down to the cards that actually exist.\" After sifting through to find the more valuable cards, they sell this onto another attacker at higher price of the mixed-working-and-not-working cards, or they pass it to their colleague who will attempt to hit the cards/creds for actual money. Digital items are useful because people selling them have high margins and have lower defenses against fraud as a result. Cheap things, especially cheap things where they can pick their price, are useful because it is less likely to trigger the attention of the card holder or their bank. (This is one reason charities get abused very frequently, because they will often happily accept a $1 or lower donation, even one which is worth less than their lowest possible payment processing cost.) The bad guys don't want to be noticed because the real theft is in the future, by them or (more likely) by someone they sell this newly-more-valuable card information onto. This hit the company I used to run back in the day, also on Paypal, and was quite frustrating. I solved it by adding a few heuristics to catch and giving a user matching those heuristics the product for free, with the usual message they got in case of a successful sale. This quickly spoils your website for the purpose they're trying to use it for, and the professional engineering team employed to abuse you experiences thirty seconds of confusion and regret before moving to the next site on their list. Back in the day, the bad guys were extremely bad at causing their browser instance to even try to look like a normal user in terms of e.g. pattern of data access prior to attempting to buy a thing. Hope some of that is useful. Best of luck and skill. You can eventually pierce through to Paypal's attention here and they may have options available contingent on you being under card/credential testing attack, or they might not. I was not successful in doing so back in the day prior to solving the problem for myself. Would also recommend building monitoring so you know this is happening in the future before the disputes roll in. Note that those disputes might be from them or from the legitimate users depending on exactly what credentials they have stolen, and in the case they are from legitimate users, you may not have caught all of the fraudulent charges yet. (Mentioning because you said \"all of the charges\" were disputed.) If I were you I'd try to cast a wider net and pre-emptively refund or review things in the wider net, both because the right thing to do and also because you may be able to head off more disputes later as e.g. people get their monthly statements. reply",

          "text": "This is a money laundering scheme where they are trying out how far they can go per domain. It's also a bug in the paypal API that they're abusing, where the SDK doesn't differ between example.com and www.example.com. If webshops like yours get exploited and used for money laundering, they will mix transactions from those two subdomains, while leaving the www.example.com domain as it is. The support people at paypal are dumb enough to not take care about each case, and usually they mix transactions later also via other social media services that have microtransactions (e.g. tiktok or snapchat streams where you can gift away items). The way paypal support's workflow works is that they have to nanually identify each and every transaction separately, meaning a human will be busy for weeks on end. Not kidding you. That's how the scammers keep winning with schemes like this. Usually there's also no way to escalate this, not even for business customers, at paypal, due to how their support offices are structured organizationally. As a mitigation I'd recommend to block ASNs that are known hosters that do this, and double check your webshop version for known vulnerabilities and fixes. If you don't use docker already, start to virtualize your webshop software now. I can't stress how important this is. Also double check any users and passwords you are using for the services, and the rest of the filesystem for indicators on the VPS. Disable SSH passwords and use only SSH key authentication on the VPS in case this hasn't been done already. I'm writing this because usually this kind of scheme starts to happen after the server got pwned already, and after e.g. the ssh password bruteforce scanner was successful or after the web exploit / persistence exploit was successful. If you need a starting point to block those botnet affiliated networks, I started both a firewall and scam database project that does exactly this: [1] https://github.com/cookiengineer/antispam [2] https://github.com/tholian-network/firewall reply",

          "text": "It can't easily, Docker should not be naively treated as a security solution. It's very easy to misconfigure it: - The Docker daemon runs as root: any user in the docker group effectively also has sudo (--privileged) - Ports exposed by Docker punch through the firewall - In general, you can break the security boundary towards root (not your user!) by mounting the wrong things, setting the wrong flags etc. What Docker primarily gives you is a stupid (good!) solution for having a reproducible, re-settable environment.\nBut containers (read: magic isolated box) are not really a good tool to reason about security in Linux imo. If you are a beginner, instead make sure you don't run services as the sudo-capable/root user as a first step.\nThen, I would recommend you look into Systemd services: you can configure all the Linux sandboxing features Docker uses and more.\nThis composes well with Podman, which gives you a reproducible environment (drop-in replacement for Docker) but contained to an unprivileged user. reply",

          "text": "> Docker is for organizing things for yourself, just like directories are. Services have the following dependencies: static data files; configuration files; executable code/binaries; library dependencies. In days of yonder, you'd need to download/install all of that ^ on each machine where \"service A\" needs to run. Developers would run and test \"service A\" on ubuntu 18.04. But production servers had to run ubuntu 16.04 because \"service X\" that also runs on the same server needs a library that has not been ported to 18.04 yet. But \"service A\" needs a library that was never available on 16.04. Welcome to dependency hell! Containers bundle all of those dependencies into one object that can be downloaded directly onto the host server, ready for the \"service A\" process to execute. Now it doesn't matter if production servers are running 16.04. Everything \"service A\" needs is stored inside the container blob (including some minimal ubuntu 18.04 stuff). the magic that lets this happen -- containers re-use the host server's OS kernel. Running a new ubuntu 18.04 container does not start a new OS kernel running. the process for your container is just 'firewalled' off from all other processes using cgroups [0]. containers re-use the host's kernel, start a cgroup'd process which starts your container's services and processes (the 18.04 'OS' services and your binary/code/executable). short/simpler version: containers share the core of the underlying operating system on the host server. > If you want actual isolation you have to take extra steps. unfortunately, this means containers share the core of the underlying operating system on the host server. containers not being isolated from the host server OS can present a security risk as you can escape from the container and \"do bad things to host server\". [1] In cases where that is a problem you mostly have two choices: * use VMs instead (a completely isolated OS instance is started for each service, cannot interact with the host OS at all -- this uses a lot more memory/cpu) * use rootless containers [2] (container processes are launched under a specific user namespace rather than kernel namespace -- escaping the container means you only get access to the user namespace) [0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups [1]: by default the docker daemon service and all the container processes it starts are running as root, which means escaping out of a container in a a default docker installation is as bad as giving someone root.

Each application service (or a logical group of application services) is packaged directly into an immutable VM image, and the orchestration manages these VMs directly. No separate container runtime or container orchestration layer on top of the VM. So you have an Immutable, Bootable System Image, but you would use kvm plus .iso plus orchestration tech. Basically, why does nobody built a cloud on the cloud lol??

          "text": "Im not op and I’m not sure they are using it for money laundering. A money launderer can use a marketplace by creating a seller account and buying from himself. Since he’s the one buying he doesn’t need to deliver anything but he gets the money from a legit source. Usually he would use a payment method as close to money as possible so that it leaves less traces. But in OPs case, the amounts are low so he needs too many transactions to get something valuable. And because of the disputes, he’s (probably) not getting the money (?). It could be card testing: the fraudster has a bunch of cards and doesn’t know which is valid or canceled. The best way to find out is to test in a real site. So he’ll test out each of them and the ones that go through are good to use elsewhere. The thing is that it would be better for him not to dispute the transactions so the OP would take much longer to find out about the scheme and shut it down. It’s better to use low amount transactions in this case so it doesn’t use too much of the credit available for him to defraud and probably doesn’t warn the card owner. Another option is doing it just to hurt the OP marketplace. If you have too many disputes the brands can fine you and if you don’t solve the problem they can turn your account off. I’ve seen it happen when a competitor was trying to hurt the e-commerce. It’s a low move and rare but it happens. One thing that might help is to analyze the sellers too. In a money laundering and even in the other settings, it could be part of the scheme. Are they new accounts? Are their volume exploding out of nowhere? Etc reply",

          "text": "It's pretty easy to figure out max capacity of any of those businesses. Audit the traffic and compare against reported figures. So yeah, you can get away with it, but can't go overboard. It's safer to just waste some high margin inventory to keep. A bar I used to go to was a ML operation and they would just ring in lots of expensive drinks throughout the night and then the boss would come in and settle up the registers. No matter how much I drank my tab was always $20. The same was true for pretty much anyone that was a regular. It was great because it was definitely impressive to order a round of patrons shots for everyone at the bar. On a busy night there would be a couple instances where the DJ would bring up one of \"the guys\" and let him announce that the DJ was gonna play his 3 favorite songs and while they were playing everybody in the bars drinks would be on him.  Very fun. reply",

          "text": "+1. As mentioned on the side, this will negatively impact your conversion rate. But you don't need to leave it on forever, either; you can use it to get some breathing room. The attacker may lose interest or move on to more fruitful targets if they find themselves blocked even temporarily. This is the \"don't need to be faster than the bear\" dynamic of online fraud: there are infinite targets and you don't need to perfectly shut out an attacker to make the ROI unappealing for them. My thoughts on the scenario: 1. Chargebacks are not just a financial problem. There is no amount of money you can pay to regain the trust of your sellers (as it's a marketplace) or to change terms with your payment providers. 2. If the emails come from the same domain, can you block the domain? There are lots of throwaway domains, but it's effort for the attacker to switch them, too. 3. CAPTCHAs are increasingly ineffective between captcha solving services and multi-modal AI. I've heard in a few recent attacks that hCaptcha does a little better than Turnstile or reCAPTCHA. 4. Shadowbanning is good for wasting your attacker's time, which is really important to kill their ROI. You'll need to get your false positive rate low though to not piss off your actual good customers. 5. Your scenario (no API, browser required, no bot activity expected) is a really good fit for properly implemented device fingerprinting. I'm the PM for Fraud & Security at Stytch and we do have a Device Fingerprinting product. It's harder to trial than the open-source ones, but the advantage is that attackers can't inspect the implementation to evade it. Would you be interested in talking more? I'm happy to walk through your current controls and see if it makes sense to test Device Fingerprinting, shoot me an email at (first letter of my username) + (last four letters of my username) @ stytch.com . reply",

          "text": "Assume that the transactions are coming from humans, it is often cheaper to instruct humans than it is to automate when there’s an expectation that you will try to mitigate the malicious behavior. Be willing to temporarily suspend your services in order to prevent the malicious behavior. Do the manual work to allow genuine customers to keep using your service, e.g: require manual account approval. You need to treat every one of these chargeback transactions as a risk to your businesses ability to operate, each that you allow to happen increases the risk of permanent damage to your business. Reach out to your account manager at PayPal, this is not something that should be going via frontline support. You need to be talking to a person who knows and is responsible for your account. If you don’t have one, get one. If you can’t get one, look for anti payment fraud businesses that work with PayPal, they may be able to get a direct line to PayPal on your behalf. For the future, if you’re dependent upon a service provider you should always have someone you can reach out to directly. If a provider isn’t willing to offer that, find a different provider. Financial services especially are very risk averse and will jettison your account if they get even a whiff of something untoward, whether you tried to prevent it or not. The cost of recovering from that will dwarf the cost of any drastic mitigation you take now. Losing your PayPal account is worse than turning off purchases for a few days. reply",

Their support sucks and is completely unhelpful, managing your account was at the time extremely complex, compared any other payment solution. Our rule taking PayPal: Transfer EVERYTHING out of your PayPal account on a daily basis, do not let them hold your funds, they will block you from accessing it at some point. Minimize what they can touch. Also don't all smaller amounts to be paid with PayPal. This prevents you from being abused as a source for verifying stolen accounts. The only company I dealt with that came close to the same level of incompetency was Klarna. Klarna didn't at the time understand the concept of fraud, because they're Swedish and their system in Sweden MOSTLY prevented fraud at the time. Once people found away around that and Klarna expanded beyond Sweden, they gave up and attempted to stick the bill on us, despite their contracts clearly stated that they where responsible for collecting payments. reply",

To avoid this, I do a few things: - We have a no-questions-asked unlimited refund policy. - I don't tolerate unverified PayPal buyer purchases. However, if someone tries to buy with one, I activate the subscription, and then contact the buyer via the e-mail/phone number they signed up with, confirm they're a real person, and then send them a PayPal invoice. - Only subscriptions can be purchased. - We've configured the flow when using PayPal to not tell the user if a transaction is declined to the maximum extent possible. I.e., the subscription still gets activated and then we call the user to arrange other payment options. reply",

          "text": "> often you can pay by card at the pump. That’s definitely an innovation that creates convenience but does it really change the commercial function of the station much?  You are still essentially transacting for fuel, which is what gas stations have done for decades.  My guess is while a lot of stations provide that ability out of customer demand, but the owners would probably rather the customer come in and buy the over priced soda and Doritos along with the gas purchase.  I don’t think owner-operators make hardly anything on the fuel sales. With my comment I was thinking more along the lines of overall footprint of the station and what products are being sold.  I think self-service pushed the ability for stations to service more pumps and with a person anchored to a register inside instead of outside attending to the pumps, it allowed the ability of stations to expand to more a mini-mart concept easily where more profitable products (to the station owner) are sold. EV charging might help bring people into the food, but i suspect you don’t “turn tables” fast enough to make EV charging beneficial enough to bringing enough people inside to warrant devoting a lot of space to that activity. reply",

Meanwhile almost all new cars here are BEV, even out in many rural areas BEVs are 50% of new sales. A local store can relatively easily and cheaply install a supercharger. Installing a hydrogen pump is presumably much more expensive as it requires more space and more complex equipment. And it needs refilling by truck, while electricty just flows. And while EV chargers or cars can catch fire during charging, hydrogen can explode violently[1][2] when mixed with air (the one in Norway registered as an earthquake 30 km, 20 miles, away).

          "text": "A fascinating thought exercise. It mirrors a question we obsess over every day at my startup: \"In 15 years, what will an 'office' visit look like?\" My bet for the gas station: they become high-density \"Service Hubs.\" The main product won't be selling gas, but selling time and convenience back to the driver. Think ultra-fast EV charging bays, automated Amazon package return kiosks, a great coffee subscription service, and maybe even quick biometric health check pods. They'll be data-driven, hyper-efficient service points. I believe the traditional office is facing the same existential shift. Its core \"product\" a desk to sit at from 9 to 5 is becoming as obsolete as the gasoline pump. The \"office\" of the future isn't a physical place; it's a system. A Workspace OS where the most important flow isn't people commuting to a building, but information flowing seamlessly from conversation → to idea → to action. It's a space where an AI teammate handles the repetitive work (summarizing meetings, tracking tasks), freeing up humans to do the deep, creative work that truly matters. So, in 2040, perhaps the best gas stations and the best offices will have one thing in common: you'll barely notice they're there. They'll just be a seamless, intelligent system that helps you get where you need to go whether that's across the country, or from a great idea to a finished product. reply",

          "text": "I know my view will be affected by the UK being generally a small country... most people aren't driving 200+ miles a day, which means 90% of charging will be at home. Driving longer that 200 miles means you probably want a decent break. So I would imagine that most \"local\" places will disappear / pivot into shops with EV charging also. Motorway services will also change I think. Fast food isnt as much of an appeal when you're stuck there for an hour or so anyway. So I could see a rise in retrain complexes with charging abilities. possibly changes in behaviour will also affect things. If im traveling 4-6hrs in a day, id be ok with stopping of for an hour at a shopping centre where I could charge and also do some shopping, maybe let the kids play in a softplay or whatever The first clever folks to stick a bull ring within 5 minutes drive of the M6 will 200+ charging points will do VERY well I think. reply",

          "text": "The process has already begun - UK petrol station numbers are down by a third since the beginning of the century. As you say, they'll all but cease to exist in urban areas, with the process mostly complete by the end of the 2030s. I'm not sure that dedicated EV charging stations will be all that common in cities, though. Why not use existing car parks for that? Some probably will end up being used as surface car parks where there's demand for it, but urban land values are such that I suspect most will be knocked down and replaced with apartments or larger retail units. A few may retain the forecourt structures as a form of kitsch (think of the florists beside Regents Park in London, or the Hyde Park Book Club in Leeds). There'll probably be a growing niche for domestic fuel delivery services. You might also see a minor resurgence of the very small neighbourhood filling stations that mostly died out in the 1970s/80s - the sort of place that does MOT checks or tyre changes today. Some might end up installing a pump or two, to cater for vintage car enthusiasts. reply",

          "text": "First I’d answer the question: should there be any gas stations at all? With self driving vehicles you could imagine a future where self driving gas dispensing trucks roam the highways to refill cars as they go. Or instead of trucks you could imagine that the left lane on highways could be replaced by some kind of train on rails that your car could dock to. In that train you’d have the same crap you have in current gas stations: mostly toilets and food stuff. Cars docking to stuff is something that really clicks with me, but you could really go one step further away. You could split cars between the part that runs and the part that carries passengers. The part that carries people could be some kind of capsule akin to a boat container that could be loaded onto something else. When on the highway, this cabin could be put on some giant train that would carry hundreds of these capsules and when you need to get off the highway, your capsule would be loaded on some independent single-capsule vehicle, that would drive you where you need to go. It’s probably all terrible ideas because that would make everything a lot less resilient to problems in terms of operation, but you said sci fi :-) Oh and yeah 15 years is way too short to see that kind of changes. reply",

No matter what, only a very few people can be accommodated at once. On the flip side, setting up a gas station is hard, but that’s not the case with EV charging stations — especially if battery swapping is innovated. It also takes time to deeply penetrate the market, but EV charging is much more suitable for two-wheelers. So there’s a clear gap — the current gas stations can’t handle the volume of people waiting for EV charging. What is the way forward? I feel anyone with an EV charger can set up an EV charging station at home. This means all your malls, houses, and parks might be converted into EV charging stations, making it much more decentralized. I anticipate that anyone with an EV charger and good parking space can make some extra bucks from it. I feel the whole idea of gas stations might be democratized.

While it may be okay to have a busy highway/motorway service station properly hooked up, it get's more difficult to apply that more broadly. How much charging capacity should a shopping centre provide? What about a occasionally-used sports venue? I have worked with customers that have distribution centres in city locations to charge online-shopping vehicles overnight for the next day. All vehicles are plugged in and the software needs to charge different vehicles up at different times and rates, in order to spread the load. It is far easier to dig a hole in the ground and fill a tank with delivered fuel - all the logistics for this already exists. * Maximum demand is a well-known concept that relates to the maximum current draw in a 30-minute period, which is used to provide the necessary infrastructure from the electricity supplier. reply",

This has already happened in the U.S. Southeast. It's called \"Bucc-ee's\". They're very large gas stations with 50+ pumps. They have a squirrel for a mascot and sometimes if you go there's someone dressed up as the mascot there. Inside, it's not a traditional restaurant but they're well known for selling barbecue (e.g. brisket). They also have large sections of the inner store dedicated to selling lots of rustic and outdoor type things that you'd traditionally get at a department store--things like grills, tents, etc. It's a destination for sure. reply",

          "text": "Why not? These fleets have been quasi electric since the 1970s They move slowly on dedicated predictable paths all controlled by the same system that choreographs their movements, controls who goes in for system charges.  Some of them are EV in the sense they use electricity but they have no batteries.  More of them now have batteries but they can in no way be compared to the usage patterns of human use cases.  This is why batteries have been viable for them since the 70's.  Massive inefficient monsters on slow moving controlled paths.   Some of them charge whilst moving using massive cables laid out in the roads in the mine.  In a mine slow and steady wins the race.  In the rest of the world it would be chaos or more specifically not viable. Big-rigs also make sense as the fleet owned and controlled trucks can charge at dedicated yards and will all move in coordinated efforts. There are still no viable 3500 through 7500 series trucks operated by small to medium business owners and those run the short haul of many industries in the USA.  As such the diesel versions of them will be around for a very long time.  I keep an eye on battery tech for my own selfish reasons and have yet to see anything that would power those trucks without pushing them over their weight limits to the point of making them legally unusable.  As is business owners skirt the line when they are on the scales.  Heavy batteries would require them to cut their loads and effectively also eat their profits and waste a lot of their time making multiple trips.  If they become viable I will see it right away as I am surrounded by them and business owners will do what makes financial sense.  I will be the first to change opinions on this when it is a profitable option. The closest I have yet to see in Science Fiction levels of battery improvement is 3D printed solid state batteries and they have a long way to go just to make it into tools, cell phones, etc...  That needed to happen a decade ago if we want to see them in big trucks within 15 years.  I would love to be proven wrong ... for my own selfish reasons unrelated to electric vehicles. reply",

          "text": "Interesting Q - though I predict they will largely look the same. They may have more battery charging stations or replacement batteries (especially for stations on an interstate) but otherwise I think it will just be a nicer version of what we have today. Maybe higher quality hot food and more interesting snacks, which I think we are already seeing today with new stations. Most gas stations today only have one employee at a time so it seems hard to cut that down (and not much incentive tbh). Electric cars today are still under 10%. Cars last a really long time, so even if there is a huge surge in electric self-driving cars by 2030 there will still be lots of ICE cars on the road in 15 years. reply",

          "text": "By 2040, I suspect not much will have changed. In the US, most engines that required leaded gasoline rolled off the assembly lines in the 1960s, with the legal phase-out beginning in the 1970s, and finally ending in the 1990s. As I have a classic car that I intend to keep running, I suspect eventually (e.g. not by 2040), buying fuel for it will be similar to buying pre-mixed fuel for small two-stroke engines, like leafblowers and chainsaws: go to Auto Zone and buy a few gallons of fuel. Auto Zone and friends won't be going anywhere - EVs still need wiper blades, brake pads, and other incidentals. reply",

Then we will start to see more EV chargers than gas stations.

I have a (few years old) copy of Library Genesis converted to plaintext and it's around 1TB. I think libgen proper was 50-100TB at the time, so we can probably assume that AA (~1PB) would be around 10-20TB when converted to plaintext. You'd probably spend several weeks torrenting a chunk of the archive, converting everything in it to plaintext, deleting the originals, then repeating with a new chunk until you have plaintext versions of everything in the archive. Then indexing all that for full text search would take even more storage and even more time, but still perfectly doable on commodity hardware. The main barriers are going to be reliably extracting plaintext from the myriad of formats in the archive, cleaning up the data, and selecting a decent full text search database (god help you if you pick wrong and decide you want to switch and re-index everything later). reply",

Converting media that is currently completely un-indexed into plaintext and offering a suite of search features for finding content within it would be a game-changer, IMO! If you've ever done a lit review for any field other than ML, I'm guessing you know how reliant many fields are on relatively-old books and articles (read: PDFs at best, paper-only at worst) that you can basically only encounter via a) citation chains, b) following an author, or c) encyclopedias/textbooks. 2. I really don't see how this could ever lead to any kind of legal issue. You're not hosting any of the content itself, just offering a search feature for it. GoodReads doesn't need legal permission to index popular books, for example. In general I get the sense that your comment is written from the perspective of an entrepreneur/startup mindset. I'm sure that's brought you meaning and maybe even some wealth, but it's not a universal one! Some of us are more interested in making something to advance humanity than something likely to make a profit, even if we might look silly in the process. reply",

You don't need to host copyrighted material. It's all about intent . The Pirate Bay is (imo correctly, even if I disagree with other aspects about copyright law and its enforcement) seen as a place where people go to find ways to not pay authors for their content. They never hosted a copyrighted byte but they're banned in some form (DNS, IP, domain seizures) in many countries. Proxies of TPB also, so being like an ISP for such a site is already enough, whereas nobody is ordering blocks of Comcast's IP addresses for providing access to websites with copyrighted material because they didn't have a somewhat-provable intent to provide copyright infringement When I read the OP, I imagine this would link from the search results directly to Anna's archive and sci-hub, but I think you'd have to spin it as a general purpose search page and ideally not even mention AA was one of the sources, much less have links (Don't get me wrong: everyone wants this except the lobby of journals that presently own the rights) It would be a real shame if an anonymous third party that's definitely not the website operator made a Firefox add-on that illegitimately inserts these links to search results page though reply",

It can be roughly translated to \"you don't understand, it's a completely different situation\". That's what's constantly on my mind when I'm reading discussions like this one. Everybody and their dog torrenting petabytes of data and getting away with it (Meta is the only one that got caught and they've still gotten away with doing it)? The very same data poor American students were forced to commit suicide over? The same data that average American housewives were sued over for millions of dollars of \"damages\"? The same data that often gets random German plumbers or steelworkers to pay thousands of euros of \"fines\" to the copyright mafia so they won't get sued and have their lives ruined? Yet when giant corporations are doing the exact same thing on a massive scale, it's fine? It's not even the same thing, an American student torrenting books isn't making any money off it, while Meta very much is. Of course it's not the same, a simple-minded and poorly educated person like me isn't capable of understanding the difference. You keep believing in your moral superiority, the rest of the world has finally woken up. reply",

Honestly was too tired to point that out in my earlier reply, but that's exactly the kind of argument you get when people are not willing (or purposefully refusing) to consider details. Intentionally or not, you get bogus and highly manipulative statements. A single case of a student activist fighting for freedom of communication and access to public goods for citizens, ending up breaking under pressure from public/non-profit institutions MIT, JSTOR, FBI over copyright, is not the same as what GP implied - many students, regular folks just like you and me, being forced to take their own lives due to legal consequences of pirating books in bulk. Nothing like the latter ever happened anyway. We can do better than this. (And even if we can't, I trust the courts can.) -- [0] - Curiously, while doing some search now to be sure I didn't miss any similar case, I learned that JSTOR incident wasn't the first for 'aaronsw - apparently, he did the same thing a few years earlier with public court documents[1]; FBI investigated this too, and concluded he was legally in the clear. It's probably well-known to everyone here, but I somehow missed it, so #TodayILearned.

They used their infinite VC money supply to interfere with and delay investigations and enforcement, betting that if they do it fast enough, they'll have the general population on their side. LLM vendors found and exploited[0] a legal uncertainty - correct me if I'm wrong, but AFAIK it still isn't settled whether or not their actions were actually illegal. Unlike Uber, LLM vendors aren't breaking into markets by ignoring the laws to outcompete incumbents, and burning stupid amounts of money just to get away with it. On the contrary, LLM vendors are simply providing an actually useful product, and charging a reasonable price for it, while reinvesting it into improving the product. Effects it has on other markets aside[1], their business model is just providing actual value in exchange for money. That's much more direct and honest than most of the tech industry . The product itself is also different. Uber is selling a mirage, a \"miracle\" improvement that quickly turns not so, and is destined to eventually destroy the markets it disrupted. LLM vendors are developing and serving systems that provide actual value to users, directly and obviously so. -- [0] - Probably walked into this without initially realizing it. No one complained 5-10 years ago, where the datasets were smaller and the resulting models had no real-world utility. It's only when the models became useful, that some people started looking for ways to make them go away.

In this case Congress.gov is missing rich formatting which we have (I'm not sure why they are missing it for this bill, normally they have it). GovTrack also allows making diff-like comparisons between bill versions and between bills (for example, you can see the last-minute changes made ahead of the vote on this bill). Source code is available on GitHub if anyone wants to try making GovTrack better, although it's quite complicated because Congressional information is complicated and there's no real money behind this: https://github.com/govtrack/govtrack.us-web/ If anyone has particular thoughts on what would be helpful when viewing bill text --- within the realm of the information that is actually freely available --- I am all ears. reply",

Republicans in Congress, including Rep. Issa for example, were helpful in expanding the information that Congress publishes publicly. In the last 15 years, efforts to make Congress publish more and better-structured information have been relatively bipartisan and, mostly, led by nonpolitical staff. I would not describe Democrats as having been the ones to have exclusively created the access to congressional information that we have today, although Democrats in recent years have led on government transparency and accountability issues generally, beyond the Legislative Branch. Changes that have required legislation have, as far as I'm aware, not really been influenced by the President, other than being signed into law, since they are Legislative Branch concerns and not Executive Branch concerns. reply",

I am also eyeing whisperX[2], because I want to play some more with speaker diarization. Your use-case seems to be batch transcription, so I'd suggest you go ahead and just use whisperfile, it should work well on an M4 mini, and it also has an HTTP API if you just start it without arguments. If you want more interactivity, I have been using Vibe[3] as an open-source replacement of SuperWhisper[4], but VoiceInk from a sibling comment seems better. Aside: It seems that so many of the mentioned projects use whisper at the core, that it would be interesting to explicitly mark the projects that don't use whisper, so we can have a real fundamental comparison.

          "text": "That's a great question, as the transcription stack landscape is evolving quickly. As the founder of an AI collaboration platform (Markhub), we've tested several options for our own internal \"AI teammate,\" MAKi. Our stack is a hybrid approach, as we've found no single service is best for everything: For Real-Time & High-Volume Transcription: We use Google's Speech-to-Text API (via Vertex AI). We found its accuracy with various accents and noisy environments to be top-tier, which is critical for turning real-world meeting audio into usable data. It's not the cheapest, but the reliability is worth it for our core product. For Bundled Transcription + Summarization (What you're asking about): You're right to look at models that can handle this in one go. We use Gemini for this exact purpose. The ability to send an audio file and get back a structured summary, not just a raw transcript, is a huge workflow accelerator. We point our audio data to the model and ask it to not only transcribe but also extract action items, which is a core feature of our platform. For Local/CLI Batching (As you mentioned): We've had great success with OpenAI's Whisper running in a containerized environment for internal, less time-sensitive tasks. Using a fine-tuned version of Whisper on a dedicated machine for batch processing can be very cost-effective. Your M4 mini should be able to handle the base models of Whisper quite well, especially using a tool like whisper.cpp. My takeaway: For a production API, a robust cloud service like Google's or a powerful model like Gemini is more reliable. For local or batch processing, a self-hosted Whisper setup is a fantastic and powerful option. Good luck! reply",

          "text": "A combination of engines generally gets the best WER with additional cost. hosted whisper + gemini 2.5 flash lite with custom deconfliction based on what each one does best is a reasonable path. Gemini does general conversation and silence better than whisper v3 large but whisper v3 large does better specialty vocab. Of course both after and before the merge, common transcription errors are fixed with a dictionary based lookup (that preserves punctuation, etc). This combo stays multi-lingual and is pretty cheap but is complex. There are better single source transcription vendors out there but they generally fail to either provide multi-lingual, or to provide timing info or are ridiculously expensive, or or or... I think the next gen of multi-modal models will make this all moot as they will likely crush transcription. Gemini shows that direction right now. OpenAI does a bad job of it but is in the game. Anthropic is surprisingly not really engaged in this yet (but they did just announce real time audio so they gotta be thinking about it). reply",

          "text": "Interesting thread. We're building Markhub, a B2B collaboration SaaS, and we have a pragmatic, hybrid approach to our observability stack. Our philosophy is: use open source where it gives us control and flexibility, and use managed SaaS where it saves us time and engineering overhead. Here's our stack: Logs: We self-host a simple stack using Fluentd to collect logs, which are then shipped to Elasticsearch for storage and analysis. It's powerful, gives us full control over our data, and is more cost-effective at our scale than a managed logging service. Metrics & Monitoring: For this, we decided not to reinvent the wheel. We use Datadog. The out-of-the-box dashboards, alerting, and deep integration with our cloud provider (AWS/GCP) save our small team hundreds of hours. The cost is justified by the engineering time we save. Traces: We're currently using Datadog's APM for tracing as well, as it's tightly integrated. However, we're actively exploring moving to OpenTelemetry for more vendor neutrality in the future. It's working out well. The key has been to be honest about our most valuable resource: engineering time. We self-host where we have a clear need for control (logs), and we pay for a service where the platform provides undeniable value and speed (metrics/monitoring). reply",

Documentation isn't all there and some of the debian packages aren't stellar (so you may want to build your own, which is ezpz) but IME it's a reliable stack. They do integrate with Grafana much like Prometheus but we are not happy with Grafana[0] and recommendations for something low-maintenance we can drop in to the above stack instead would be awesome. [0]: Why? Managing dashboards/plugins in an airgapped IaC setting is like pulling teeth at every other turn. Then at one point supposedly we had the container version pinned (by tag not sha, lesson learned) but yet at some point an image update from Docker Hub broke most of our dashboard/data-source links so now those dashboards are broken and I'd rather try something new before I recommit to Grafana. reply",

You can also explore having OpenTelemetry collectors in the middle for more sophisticated processing and if you want to keep an eye on its ecosystem. This is still the goto OSS stack, and I wouldn’t really recommend looking into smaller projects (usually backed by a single vendor) that are claiming better performance/lower resource usage for the same capabilities, because that always comes with a cost. reply",

To buy (and keep) one, you have to be rich enough that a couple months' rent is nothing, self-confident (or socially oblivious) enough that you don't mind looking like a Star Wars droid knock-off, and masochistic enough to want to take your neck to the gym every time you want to watch a movie. Not a very big target audience... It's too heavy and limited to be a useful personal screen. It's useless for gaming. It's too expensive to be an occasional-use-only device. It's a solution to a problem nobody had, and it solves none of the problems people do have. Sure, it had a lot of fancy tech, and maybe made sense as a laboratory prototype, but not a consumer device. You can do more with the $300 Facebook goggles for 10% of the price, or get one of the pricier but slimmer AR glasses (Xreal, etc.) reply",

          "text": "> But to be fair similar-style criticisms were levied against the iPhone Really? That was a long time ago, but I don't remember that sort of criticism towards the iPhone... though maybe my memory is just foggy? It seemed to all happen so quick, with Google copying them with the G1 soon afterward, and then... well, the rest is history. The iPhone was a streamlined evolution of an existing niche (PalmPilots, Blackberries, Nokia Communicator, etc.). When I first heard about the Vision Pro, I really hoped that they made a much simpler, slimmed-down version of the Oculus, something more like the Xreal glasses. I was surprised when they went the other way instead, doubling down on all the extra-fancy tech that just added more bulk and expense. I don't think anyone ever thought, \"Man, the thing VR really needs? A scary recording of my eyes on the front.\" They somehow managed to find the nightmarish \"sweet spot\" between dorkiness and the uncanny valley, and then jacked up the price 3x-10x compared to all the other VR headsets... On the other hand, I do remember similar criticisms towards the first iPod, famously compared to the Nomad and other MP3 players of that time ( https://slashdot.org/story/01/10/23/1816257/apple-releases-i... )... is that what you're referring to? reply",

          "text": "$3000 for what? That seems high outside of in-demand urban areas. In the rural parts of Oregon and California where I've lived, $2000 would get you a nice house with 2 or 3 bedrooms, and $1750 would get you a studio or 1 bedroom pretty easily. It just depends. As a single dude, I don't think I've ever paid $3000 for rent, anywhere I've lived, urban or rural. I think $2200 was the max and that was for a nicer short term rental.

So to me \"rent\" has always been \"cheap small apartment in a relatively safe but not luxurious part of town\". It's all relative :) Even now, with a steady partner, both mid-career and in our late 30s/early 40s, we can only afford to rent one half of a duplex (for about $2000). That gets us 2bd/2ba next to a nice little hiking spot though, so we feel quite lucky! It's a very different life than the millionaire FAANG folks live, I assume. We barely scrape by month to month, but we're content and grateful for what we do have :) Just means no Vision Pro in our futures, lol.

There's not a huge number, but I see some: $1600 / month (3bd 2ba ~1400sqft) https://www.trulia.com/home/5449-pepperwood-ct-stone-mountai... $1400 / month (3bd 3ba ~1400sqft) https://www.trulia.com/home/640-woodcrest-manor-dr-stone-mou... $1600 / month (3bd, 2ba, ~1100sqft) https://www.trulia.com/home/1616-w-austin-rd-decatur-ga-3003...

I'm not sure where you live where the average rent is $2400 for a similarly sized 2-3 bedroom house, but if you work remotely - it's trivial to find significantly cheaper rents.

I work with a company who builds interactive educational experiences in VR and even they can't use it because it can't do basic things like accurately keep track of hand positioning or gestures (beyond pitch). Really the only use case for it is as a media device, but the price is way too high to buy it for that alone. If the hope was that businesses and developers were going to buy one and start developing an ecosystem around it then they probably should have made it more than a glorified 3D TV, or made it much cheaper so it was more widely accessible. I hear there's rumours they're going to add handsets soon though, so if they can do that while also bringing the price down a little that might help adoption a bit. reply",

With a price point that is too high for mass consumer adoption, it's no surprise it flopped in the retail market too. Basically, the easiest answer for what happened to Apple Vision Pro is to just look up what happened to HoloLens. It's the same basic story, just a decade in advance. reply",

I think that anything that is going to require humans to wear something on their head for entertainment purposes is not going to make it to mainstream. There will be niche uses and likely video games are a good niche. What is going to compel people to buy something like the Vision Pro when they already have smart phones that can do everything anyways? Also, humans over 40 tend to start needing reading glasses and with each year of age more and more people need them.

They are the IBM of the 90's at this point, way overvalued stock, not much room there for growth. Setting that aside, video game visuals serve a different purpose than application UI widgets for menus, forms, buttons, etc. In a video game there are different reasons to highlight objects in a game world and relative to other objects and their movement or ability to move/interact with them. Objects in a game world might have their own light source, move in different ways so that the player knows its something they can interact with. If you look at open world games there are a lot of things happening visually in varying degrees of grabbing the gamers attention. In a UI that is task oriented, like operating systems for PCs or phones, there needs to be less visual clutter, its not a game. It should be obvious to massive numbers of the population what function a UI element serves and accessibility standards come into play because often these OSes are used in corporate environments which should allow for people with different visual abilities to do their work. reply",

That's the Windows 9x style ported to a low resolution UI, probably with some shaders because computers today are fancier than 1995. It's not interesting innovation, though I agree it's much better (and feels better) than the flat UI boring aesthetic.

          "text": "For this, what takes a while is to just tinker and fry components several times. Get a breadboard, get several sensors, try to design something and iterate on your design. Plan to fry sensors and IC's. Also helps to read some basic electrical theory and know what the role of different components are. The way I got proficient is with hobbyist PCB design. What helped me is starting with schematics and datasheets and planning to finish with an assembled board. I started designing PCB's and having them assembled with JLCPCB (quite cheap: $20 or so for a run of 5 boards; $120-$150 fully assembled). I fried 2 boards before the 3rd rev booted up, then from there it's optimization. I consider the $200/mo or so in PCBA, whether boards work or not, to be my \"EE education\" -- cost efficient compared to university fees! And $200 is sort of like the \"exam,\" it's costly enough to make me really think twice about component selection/placement/etc. Not saying that's the approach you want to take because that might be hardcore / not someplace you want to get to. But I spent a long long time really wondering how electricity really works and like why you need capacitors, inductors, op-amps, etc. It never made sense to me until I created my own schematic, chose my own parts, and understood why I chose the parts I did and connected them the way I did. reply",

Don't order assembled boards when you are starting. Order cheapest bluepill (STM32F103C8T6) or non-original arduino clone and start on breadboard with that. Make pcb's only when you're ready to learn more. Expect that your first one will not work or will require some \"rewiring\", but second one may already work. You might start with some cheap through-hole components, they are a little easier to re-wire or re-solder, it's a good idea to put your first microcontroller in socket. reply",

If your end goal is to create toys for kids, then it's fine as a hobby. But without the formal training and lab access you are going to struggle to get past that point so it's pretty much impossible to turn the hobby into something more.

          "text": "For a while now, I've had the desire to make an AI that kills enemies and beats levels like a human would in the game Crypt of the Necrodancer. Here's[0] someone doing it as a human without ever taking damage. There's something close called ChoregraphAI[1] on GitHub. It simulates the entire map and does a brute force search for what will get it to the stairs. That doesn't satisfy me because it just skips most of the enemies and takes advantage of things that a human couldn't know, like where a bat will move (bats move randomly, while other enemies are completely deterministic). Also, it can't control the game and is for an old version of it (although those problems themselves seem not that big). But, I do not know what kind of AI could be written to perform the kind of long term planning and strategizing that a human would do (e.g. isolate each enemy to beat it more easily) and to beat the enemies like a human would (with special, pre-practiced strategies for certain enemies or groups of enemies), and even if I did, I get the sense that this would be really complicated for a first try and that I should gain experience making such an AI for a simpler game, though I don't know what. It might be a self-constrained challenge. It's just been floating around my head for a while because I don't really know where to start.

Build a Forth in assembly, build a Lisp in Forth, build an OS and computing environment in Lisp. AOT-compile only the Forth interpreter, load and compile the rest from source during system boot, maybe with later stages optimizing the previous stages as the system is assembling itself. I imagine two languages - Langsam and Schnell - intertwined in some sort of yin-yang fashion. Langsam is slow, dynamic, interpreted, Schnell is fast, static, compiled. Both would be LISPs. Schnell would be implemented as a library in Langsam. If you said (define (add x y) (+ x y)) in Langsam, you would get a Langsam function. If you said (s:define (add (x int) (y int)) (+ x y)) in Langsam, you would get a Langsam function which is a wrapper over a JIT-compiled Schnell function. If you invoke it, the wrapper takes care of the FFI, execution happens at C speed. Most of the complexity typical of a low-level compiled language could be moved into Langsam. I could have sophisticated type systems and C++ template like code generation implemented in a comfortable high level language. This latter part I managed to partially implement in Clojure and it works (via LLVM), it would be just too much effort to get it completed. reply",

Otherwise, the skill that seems most out of reach is keeping a job for longer than a year. I'm in a decent spot now, after a year and a half prior of being unemployed, and I feel like this might be my last real shot at a career of any kind. Other people seem to handle it fine, but this is the thing that seems most out of reach. Unlike engineering problems that are made up of abstractions with ways to break them down and piece together systems, keeping a job is as opaque of an abstraction as I'm aware of, that doesn't necessarily depend on a measurable skill or even on anything within one's control. I've never once felt stability or been able to bet on money coming in next year, and if I had the money for a mortgage, I'd be stopped by the knowledge I can't count on an income flow at any time in the future.

The ground is surprisingly hard and I've seen someone break their ankle right in front of me a few times and it does not look fun. Outdoor sport climbing is pretty easy to get into if you have bolted climbing in your area, but as you get higher the ground gets even harder so make sure you know what you're doing. Lots of good books and resources available. If you really want to get into trad climbing be prepared for a longer apprenticeship, take your time and start easy. reply",

Start by talking to people at your bouldering gym. If you hear anyone discussing going out climbing, ask if you can tag along and just watch for a few times. Watch some videos about climbing basics to get an overall feel for it and some of the concepts and terminology. I'd say you should start out \"top roping\" on smaller walls. As for equipment for that you don't need much especially since your partner will probably have a rope and gear to build an anchor, etc. You'll need, shoes, a harness, and a helmet. Going from gym bouldering to outdoor climbing _does_ require being a little more social. It's a minimum 2-person sport usually. But going as a small group and rotating roles and just hanging out watching works too.) You just need to find people you like hanging out with and you can trust. (If you don't find them at your gym, try another or ask around at outdoor stores, your local university rec department, etc.) About jobs, I can't help you.

There's some standard tricks here: FFTs, bandpass filters, etc. But I want to do more: Real-time stem separation, time signature and downbeat tracking, etc. Imagine hearing Sweet Caroline and, when the horns kick in, the whole installation 'focuses' on the horns and bright yellow light jumps between each column on each horn note, before returning to tracking the bass line or something.

While for something like a bignum library (or a heap) the actual conformance to the behavioral contract will be somewhat ad-hoc, having a lot of safety contracts also proved along the way \"for free\" (or at slightly reduced cost, anyway) is what really draws my attention. I can see spending 2x the time writing the code, and 10x the time proving things about it, in exchange for not having to spend the 100x (DAL B) or 1000x (DAL A) time testing it. reply",

I've particularly found the Shape Dynamics program to be at least somewhat interesting and while I have a sort of ok grasp of the language and mathematics of GR translating that to the SD world has been a persistent challenge. If I had time I'd try to figure that out. Briefly, one usually formulates the theory of gravity in terms of a a 4d spacetime with curvature but you can also formulate it as a theory of curved 3d shapes if you allow the lagrangian to carry more structure. This is often performed in GR, in fact, by decomposing the metric into a \"spatial\" and \"temporal\" part but shape dynamics kind of runs with this idea in an attempt to formulate a totally relational version of the theory of gravity. Shape Dynamics apparently produces a reasonable theory of gravity which agrees with GR in many situations but forbids, I believe, closed timelike curves, and may be more amenable to quantization since it re-separates space and time. Anyway, it all seems very beyond me, maybe even if I had the time, which I do not. reply",

          "text": "As a founder who also acts as the head of product for our B2B SaaS, Markhub, this is a topic I'm passionate about. Your use cases especially using an LLM to understand an undocumented codebase are very familiar. My biggest pain point wasn't just executing individual tasks with an LLM, but the \"context loss\" that happens between those tasks. The summary from my research, the user feedback from a Slack thread, and the technical spec for the feature all lived in separate places. So, we took a different approach. We built our own AI teammate, MAKi, directly into our collaboration platform. We don't just \"use\" an LLM; we've made it the central OS for our entire product development cycle. Here's our day-to-day workflow: 1. User Feedback Synthesis: Instead of manually reading user interviews or community posts, I ask MAKi: \"Summarize all feedback from the last 7 days related to our mobile app, and categorize them into 'Bugs' and 'Feature Requests'.\" MAKi reads all the scattered conversations and generates a structured report. 2. From Feedback to Spec: We then discuss that report in a chat thread. Once we decide on a feature, I ask MAKi: \"Take this conversation and our decision, and write a technical spec document for the dev team, including the user problem, proposed solution, and key action items.\" 3. Living Documentation: This is the most powerful part. As developers work on the feature, their discussions and code commits (via integration) are all linked to that initial conversation. Later, anyone can ask MAKi: \"What was the original reason we built the PWA notification feature?\" and it will instantly pull up the entire history from the first user feedback to the final decision document. We've found that the true power of LLMs isn't just in answering questions, but in creating a persistent, searchable, and intelligent memory for the entire team. reply",

          "text": "As a very early CUDA programmer who participated in the cudacontest from NVidia during 2008 and I believe one of the only entries (I'm not claiming though) to be submitted from India and got a consolation and participation prize of a BlackEdition Card, I can vouch the method which I followed. - Look up the CUDA Programming Guide from NVidia - CUDA Programming books from NVidia from developer.nvidia.com/cuda-books-archive link - Start creating small programs based on the existing implementations (A strong C implementation knowledge is required. So, brush up if needed.) - Install the required Toolchains, compilers, and I am assuming you have the necessary hardware to play around - Github links with CUDA projects. Read the code, And now you could use LLM to explain the code in the way you would need - Start creating smaller, yet parallel programs etc., etc., And in about a month or two, you should have enough to start writing CUDA programs. I'm not aware of the skill / experience levels you have, but whatever it might be, there are plenty of sources and resources available now than it was in 2007/08. Create a 6-8 weeks of study plan and you should be flying soon! Hope it helps. Feel free to comment and I can share whatever I could to guide. reply",

Older GPUs than Turing should be avoided, because they lack many capabilities of the newer cards, e.g. \"tensor cores\", and their support in the newer CUDA toolkits will be deprecated in a not very distant future, but very slowly, so for now you can still create programs for Maxwell GPUs from 10 years ago. Among the newer GPUs, the RTX 40xx SUPER series (i.e. the SUPER variants, not the original RTX 40xx series) has the best energy efficiency. The newest RTX 50xx GPUs have worse energy efficiency than RTX 40xx SUPER, so they achieve a somewhat higher performance only by consuming a disproportionately greater power. Instead of that, it is better to use multiple RTX 40xx SUPER. reply",

          "text": "I looked at the CUDA code for Leela Chess Zero and found it pretty understandable, though that was back when Leela used a DCNN instead of transformers.  DCNN's are fairly simple and are explained in fast.ai videos that I watched a few years ago, so navigating the Leela code wasn't too difficult.  Transformers are more complicated and I want to bone up on them, but I haven't managed to spend any time understanding them. CUDA itself is just a minor departure from C++, so the language itself is no big deal if you've used C++ before.  But, if you're trying to get hired programming CUDA, what that really means is they want you implementing AI stuff (unless it's game dev).  AI programming is a much wider and deeper subject than CUDA itself, so be ready to spend a bunch of time studying and hacking to come up to speed in that.  But if you do, you will be in high demand.  As mentioned, the fast.ai videos are a great introduction. In the case of games, that means 3D graphics which these days is another rabbit hole.  I knew a bit about this back in the day, but it is fantastically more sophisticated now and I don't have any idea where to even start. reply",

This is something that changes with times and trends. 2. Learning high-performance computing approaches. While a GPU and the Nvlink interfaces are Nvidia specific, working in a massively-parallel distributed computing environment is a general branch of knowledge that is translatable across HPC architectures. 3. Application specifics. If your thing is Transformers, you may just as well start from Torch, Tensorflow, etc. and rely on the current high-level abstractions, to inspire your learning down to the fundamentals. I’m no longer active in any of the above, so I can’t be more specific, but if you want to master CUDA, I would say learning how massive-parallel programming works, is the foundation that may translate into transferable skills. reply",

          "text": "I will give you personal experience learning CUDA that might be helpful. Disclaime: I don't claim that this is actually a systematic way to learn it and it is more for academic work. I got assigned to a project that needs learning CUDA as part of my PhD. There was no one in my research group who have any experience or know CUDA. I started with standard  NVIDIA courses (Getting Started with Accelerated Computing with CUDA C/C++ and there is python version too). This gave me good introduction to the concepts and basic ideas but I think after that I did most of learning by trial and error. I tried a couple of online tutorials for specific things and some books but it was always a deprecated function there or here or a change of API that make things obsolete. Or basically things changed for your GPU and now you have to be careful because yoy might be using GPU version not compatible with what I develop for in production and you need things to work for both. I think learning CUDA for me is an endeavor of pain and going through \"compute-sanitizer\" and Nsight because you will find that most of your time will go into debugging why things is running slower than you think. Take things slowly. Take a simple project that you know how to do without CUDA then port it to CUDA ane benchmark against CPU and try to optimize different aspect of it. The one advice that can be helpful is not to think about optimization at the beginning. Start with correct, then optimize.  A working slow kernel beats a fast kernel that corrupts memory. reply",

Back then I didn't find any tutorials that cover anything beyond the basics (which are still important).\nOnce you have understood the principle working mode and architecture of a GPU, I would recommend the following workflow:\n1. First create an environment so that you can actually test your kernels against baselines written in a higher-level language.\n2. If you don't have an urgent project already, try to improve/re-implement existing problems (MatMul being the first example). Don't get caught by wanting to implement all size cases. Take an example just to learn a certain functionality, rather than solving the whole problem if it's just about learning.\n3. Write the functionality you want to have in increasing complexity. Write loops first, then parallelize these loops over the grid. Use global memory first, then put things into shared memory and registers. Use plain matrix multiplication first, then use mma (TensorCore) primitives to speed things up.\n4. Iterate over the CUDA C Programming Guide. It covers all (most) of the functionality that you want to learn - but can't be just read an memorized. When you apply it you learn it.\n5. Might depend on you use-case but also consider using higher-level abstractions like CUTLASS or ThunderKitten. Also, if your environment is jax/torch, use triton first before going to CUDA level. Overall, it will be some pain for sure. And to master it including PTX etc. will take a lot of time. reply",

The skills are completely orthogonal. CUDA belongs to the domain of game developers, graphics people, high performance computing and computer engineers (hardware).

          "text": "I had a bit, limited, exposure to cuda. It was before the AI boom, during Covid. I found it easy to start. Then there was a pretty nice learning curve to get to warps, SM's and basic concepts. Then I was able to dig deeper into the integer opcodes, which was super cool. I was able to optimize the compute part pretty well, without much roadblocks. However, getting memory loads perfect and then getting closer to hw (warp groups, divergence, the L2 cache split thing, scheduling), was pretty hard. I'd say CUDA is pretty nice/fun to start with, and it's possible to get quite far for a novice programmer. However getting deeper and achieving real advantage over CPU is hard. Additionally there is a problem with Nvidia segmenting the market - some opcodes are present in _old_ gpu's (CUDA arch is _not_ forwards compatible). Some opcodes are reserved to \"AI\" chips (like H100). So, to get code that is fast on both H100 and RTX5090 is super hard. Add to that a fact that each card has different SM count and memory capacity and bandwidth... and you end up with an impossible compatibility matrix. TLDR: Beginnings are nice and fun. You can get quite far on the optimizing compute part. But getting compatibility for differnt chips and memory access is hard. When you start, chose specific problem, specific chip, specific instruction set. reply",

          "text": "For better or worse, direct professional experience in a professional setting is the only way to learn anything to a professional level. That doesn't mean one-eyed-king knowledge is never enough to solve that chicken-and-egg. You only have to be good enough to get the job. But if you haven't done it on the job, you don't have work experience and you are either lying to others or lying to yourself...and any sophisticated organization won't fall for it... ...except of course, knowingly. And the best way to get someone to knowingly ignore obvious dunning-kruger and/or horseshit is to know that someone personally or professionally. Which is to say that the best way to get a good job is to have a good relationship with someone who can hire you for a good job (nepotism trumps technical ability, always). And the best way to find a good job is to know a lot of people who want to work with you. To put it another way, looking for a job is the only way to find a job and looking for a job is also much much harder than everything that avoids looking for a job  (like studying CUDA) by pretending to be preparation...because again, studying CUDA won't ever give you professional experience. Don't get me wrong,  there's nothing wrong with learning CUDA all on your own. But it is not professional experience and it is not looking for a job doing CUDA. Finally, if you want to learn CUDA just learn it for its own sake without worrying about a job. Learning things for their own sake is the nature of learning once you get out of school.

          "text": "Great recco! I'd set it up on the network their devices connect to, as well as the device. FYI - Kids are way smarter and have so much time. I enjoyed working around my parents, who resorted to a wireless VGA mirroring device that put what was on my screen on a display in the living room (which I found a workaround for with my 3500 AGP card, see what I mean?) If your young kids use Apple devices, I'd also consider setting an MDM (you need a Mac, to erase the iOS device, and an app called Apple Configurator 2) Here are some settings I'd be sure to deploy: - Disable \"Allow Manual VPN creation\" - Disable \"Allow modifying account settings\" (creative kids will change iCloud accounts which syncs preset Wifi details from another device) - Disable \"Allow modifying cellular data app settings\" / \"Allow cellular plan changes\" + Enable \"Connect to MDM-configured Wi-Fi networks only\" after you're sure you've considered common access points you need to add I would also use a monitoring tool at home for bluetooth and wifi devices and access points that pop up. Export the log now and then and see if any devices appear around your house when your kids get home and their registered devices appear. I found vapes on my 8 year old nephew because he was using a Bluetooth app on his phone to choose profiles. 8 years old. Gotta be way proactive if you want to protect these young minds. It's nearly impossible to shield anyone for any length of time without being disconnected, which is also unhealthy for growing minds. In the end, it's all balance. But you need way more than just parental controls. Parental controls is like the little gate latch you lift to open the gate, it will be worked around. * The best way to roll this out since you must erase the iOS device is to do an upgrade swap and have them trade in their old device. reply",

And yes, kids are incredibly smart at figuring stuff out but it sounds like the DNS layer might be the simplest. I wonder if I have to lock things down like how InfoSec teams do. Will check out an MDM. Is that like Kandji that gets deployed on corporate devices? reply",

We sold 150 million cups of coffee last year,” Bernard Looney said in an interview in August (2020), referring to beverage kiosks attached to the company’s fuel stations. “This is a very strong business. It’s a growth business.” I remember I was impressed by this. The only country I drink gas-station-coffee is Finland (because where else can you find coffee in the middle of nowhere?). So right after I read that article, and the first time I saw a BP gas station I got a coffee. It was 'cheap' and I assume EUR per mg of caffeine was 'ok', but the quality/flavor.. omfg. Also, volcanic hot, so thanks but no thanks. [0]: https://businesstech.co.za/news/energy/433444/bp-doesnt-just...

          "text": "> often you can pay by card at the pump. That’s definitely an innovation that creates convenience but does it really change the commercial function of the station much?  You are still essentially transacting for fuel, which is what gas stations have done for decades.  My guess is while a lot of stations provide that ability out of customer demand, but the owners would probably rather the customer come in and buy the over priced soda and Doritos along with the gas purchase.  I don’t think owner-operators make hardly anything on the fuel sales. With my comment I was thinking more along the lines of overall footprint of the station and what products are being sold.  I think self-service pushed the ability for stations to service more pumps and with a person anchored to a register inside instead of outside attending to the pumps, it allowed the ability of stations to expand to more a mini-mart concept easily where more profitable products (to the station owner) are sold. EV charging might help bring people into the food, but i suspect you don’t “turn tables” fast enough to make EV charging beneficial enough to bringing enough people inside to warrant devoting a lot of space to that activity. reply",

          "text": "That might help a lot in Japan. Here in Norway we just have had a handful of hydrogen stations, and of those two went out of business. Meanwhile almost all new cars here are BEV, even out in many rural areas BEVs are 50% of new sales. A local store can relatively easily and cheaply install a supercharger. Installing a hydrogen pump is presumably much more expensive as it requires more space and more complex equipment. And it needs refilling by truck, while electricty just flows. And while EV chargers or cars can catch fire during charging, hydrogen can explode violently[1][2] when mixed with air (the one in Norway registered as an earthquake 30 km, 20 miles, away). As I said perhaps it will find some niche uses, but widescale adoptation seems very unlikely to me. [1]: https://norwaytoday.info/news/explosion-sandvika-hydrogen-ta...

          "text": "I know my view will be affected by the UK being generally a small country... most people aren't driving 200+ miles a day, which means 90% of charging will be at home. Driving longer that 200 miles means you probably want a decent break. So I would imagine that most \"local\" places will disappear / pivot into shops with EV charging also. Motorway services will also change I think. Fast food isnt as much of an appeal when you're stuck there for an hour or so anyway. So I could see a rise in retrain complexes with charging abilities. possibly changes in behaviour will also affect things. If im traveling 4-6hrs in a day, id be ok with stopping of for an hour at a shopping centre where I could charge and also do some shopping, maybe let the kids play in a softplay or whatever The first clever folks to stick a bull ring within 5 minutes drive of the M6 will 200+ charging points will do VERY well I think. reply",

          "text": "The process has already begun - UK petrol station numbers are down by a third since the beginning of the century. As you say, they'll all but cease to exist in urban areas, with the process mostly complete by the end of the 2030s. I'm not sure that dedicated EV charging stations will be all that common in cities, though. Why not use existing car parks for that? Some probably will end up being used as surface car parks where there's demand for it, but urban land values are such that I suspect most will be knocked down and replaced with apartments or larger retail units. A few may retain the forecourt structures as a form of kitsch (think of the florists beside Regents Park in London, or the Hyde Park Book Club in Leeds). There'll probably be a growing niche for domestic fuel delivery services. You might also see a minor resurgence of the very small neighbourhood filling stations that mostly died out in the 1970s/80s - the sort of place that does MOT checks or tyre changes today. Some might end up installing a pump or two, to cater for vintage car enthusiasts. reply",

          "text": "First I’d answer the question: should there be any gas stations at all? With self driving vehicles you could imagine a future where self driving gas dispensing trucks roam the highways to refill cars as they go. Or instead of trucks you could imagine that the left lane on highways could be replaced by some kind of train on rails that your car could dock to. In that train you’d have the same crap you have in current gas stations: mostly toilets and food stuff. Cars docking to stuff is something that really clicks with me, but you could really go one step further away. You could split cars between the part that runs and the part that carries passengers. The part that carries people could be some kind of capsule akin to a boat container that could be loaded onto something else. When on the highway, this cabin could be put on some giant train that would carry hundreds of these capsules and when you need to get off the highway, your capsule would be loaded on some independent single-capsule vehicle, that would drive you where you need to go. It’s probably all terrible ideas because that would make everything a lot less resilient to problems in terms of operation, but you said sci fi :-) Oh and yeah 15 years is way too short to see that kind of changes. reply",

Who wants to stand in line to change out propane, to be told there's only one person working, go out and wait til the line is gone?  Air is still free, but you have to go in and ask for it to be turned on. At least that's my experience, maybe each locale is different.  I literally have never seen a person buy prepared food or exchange propane at a typical gas station(wawa/buckees excluded) in my adult life. reply",

          "text": "A fascinating thought exercise. It mirrors a question we obsess over every day at my startup: \"In 15 years, what will an 'office' visit look like?\" My bet for the gas station: they become high-density \"Service Hubs.\" The main product won't be selling gas, but selling time and convenience back to the driver. Think ultra-fast EV charging bays, automated Amazon package return kiosks, a great coffee subscription service, and maybe even quick biometric health check pods. They'll be data-driven, hyper-efficient service points. I believe the traditional office is facing the same existential shift. Its core \"product\" a desk to sit at from 9 to 5 is becoming as obsolete as the gasoline pump. The \"office\" of the future isn't a physical place; it's a system. A Workspace OS where the most important flow isn't people commuting to a building, but information flowing seamlessly from conversation → to idea → to action. It's a space where an AI teammate handles the repetitive work (summarizing meetings, tracking tasks), freeing up humans to do the deep, creative work that truly matters. So, in 2040, perhaps the best gas stations and the best offices will have one thing in common: you'll barely notice they're there. They'll just be a seamless, intelligent system that helps you get where you need to go whether that's across the country, or from a great idea to a finished product. reply",

No matter what, only a very few people can be accommodated at once. On the flip side, setting up a gas station is hard, but that’s not the case with EV charging stations — especially if battery swapping is innovated. It also takes time to deeply penetrate the market, but EV charging is much more suitable for two-wheelers. So there’s a clear gap — the current gas stations can’t handle the volume of people waiting for EV charging. What is the way forward? I feel anyone with an EV charger can set up an EV charging station at home. This means all your malls, houses, and parks might be converted into EV charging stations, making it much more decentralized. I anticipate that anyone with an EV charger and good parking space can make some extra bucks from it. I feel the whole idea of gas stations might be democratized. I’m not sure — this is just what I feel. Feel free to let me know your opinion. reply",

I have worked with customers that have distribution centres in city locations to charge online-shopping vehicles overnight for the next day.

It is far easier to dig a hole in the ground and fill a tank with delivered fuel - all the logistics for this already exists. * Maximum demand is a well-known concept that relates to the maximum current draw in a 30-minute period, which is used to provide the necessary infrastructure from the electricity supplier. reply",

          "text": "Why not? These fleets have been quasi electric since the 1970s They move slowly on dedicated predictable paths all controlled by the same system that choreographs their movements, controls who goes in for system charges.  Some of them are EV in the sense they use electricity but they have no batteries.  More of them now have batteries but they can in no way be compared to the usage patterns of human use cases.  This is why batteries have been viable for them since the 70's.  Massive inefficient monsters on slow moving controlled paths.   Some of them charge whilst moving using massive cables laid out in the roads in the mine.  In a mine slow and steady wins the race.  In the rest of the world it would be chaos or more specifically not viable. Big-rigs also make sense as the fleet owned and controlled trucks can charge at dedicated yards and will all move in coordinated efforts. There are still no viable 3500 through 7500 series trucks operated by small to medium business owners and those run the short haul of many industries in the USA.  As such the diesel versions of them will be around for a very long time.  I keep an eye on battery tech for my own selfish reasons and have yet to see anything that would power those trucks without pushing them over their weight limits to the point of making them legally unusable.  As is business owners skirt the line when they are on the scales.  Heavy batteries would require them to cut their loads and effectively also eat their profits and waste a lot of their time making multiple trips.  If they become viable I will see it right away as I am surrounded by them and business owners will do what makes financial sense.  I will be the first to change opinions on this when it is a profitable option. The closest I have yet to see in Science Fiction levels of battery improvement is 3D printed solid state batteries and they have a long way to go just to make it into tools, cell phones, etc...  That needed to happen a decade ago if we want to see them in big trucks within 15 years.  I would love to be proven wrong ... for my own selfish reasons unrelated to electric vehicles. reply",

There will be enough chargers at supermarkets, malls, restaurants, anywhere people actually want to go, and most people will charge at home or work.  The remaining business won't be enough to keep in-town gas stations in business.  Range anxiety will become more of an issue for gas cars. On highways, it will be a different situation.  There will be plenty of gas and diesel still available, as the remaining business from towns becomes more concentrated.  You won't find a gas station without a restaurant attached though. Fast chargers will be common, but ultra-fast ones won't be as common as we'd like, as they will want to keep you just long enough to buy a meal, etc. reply",

They may have more battery charging stations or replacement batteries (especially for stations on an interstate) but otherwise I think it will just be a nicer version of what we have today. Maybe higher quality hot food and more interesting snacks, which I think we are already seeing today with new stations. Most gas stations today only have one employee at a time so it seems hard to cut that down (and not much incentive tbh). Electric cars today are still under 10%. Cars last a really long time, so even if there is a huge surge in electric self-driving cars by 2030 there will still be lots of ICE cars on the road in 15 years. reply",

In the US, most engines that required leaded gasoline rolled off the assembly lines in the 1960s, with the legal phase-out beginning in the 1970s, and finally ending in the 1990s. As I have a classic car that I intend to keep running, I suspect eventually (e.g. not by 2040), buying fuel for it will be similar to buying pre-mixed fuel for small two-stroke engines, like leafblowers and chainsaws: go to Auto Zone and buy a few gallons of fuel. Auto Zone and friends won't be going anywhere - EVs still need wiper blades, brake pads, and other incidentals. reply",

          "text": "Obviously the higher mass and torque of the EV causes more microplastics. This is basic materials science and the reason why EVs need tougher tires. I dont get why we're comparing F150s to the Model Y. When Im looking to buy a truck, Im not considering the Model Y (although In peeved the Ranger isnt hybrid). I have never considered a Tesla (Im not in the market for another sedan) but if I were my comparison would be something like the Accord. But sure let's compare the F150 to the model Y: back in 2021 - a base F150 weighed about 4000lb, less than a base Model Y and an F150 supercab V6 F150 was <4500 lb. [1] A long range model Y weighs about a little bit less, but the difference is less than 100 lb. Sure, I can configure the F150 to weigh 5500, but few need to and few do. So the point stands: The Model Y weighs as much as a half ton truck. Meanwhile a Ford Maverick, a truck Ford can't make enough to meet demand, weighs 3700 lb [1] https://media.ford.com/content/dam/fordmedia/North%20America... reply",

GovTrack also allows making diff-like comparisons between bill versions and between bills (for example, you can see the last-minute changes made ahead of the vote on this bill). Source code is available on GitHub if anyone wants to try making GovTrack better, although it's quite complicated because Congressional information is complicated and there's no real money behind this: https://github.com/govtrack/govtrack.us-web/ If anyone has particular thoughts on what would be helpful when viewing bill text --- within the realm of the information that is actually freely available --- I am all ears. reply",

In the last 15 years, efforts to make Congress publish more and better-structured information have been relatively bipartisan and, mostly, led by nonpolitical staff. I would not describe Democrats as having been the ones to have exclusively created the access to congressional information that we have today, although Democrats in recent years have led on government transparency and accountability issues generally, beyond the Legislative Branch. Changes that have required legislation have, as far as I'm aware, not really been influenced by the President, other than being signed into law, since they are Legislative Branch concerns and not Executive Branch concerns. reply",

          "text": "Interesting thread. We're building Markhub, a B2B collaboration SaaS, and we have a pragmatic, hybrid approach to our observability stack. Our philosophy is: use open source where it gives us control and flexibility, and use managed SaaS where it saves us time and engineering overhead. Here's our stack: Logs: We self-host a simple stack using Fluentd to collect logs, which are then shipped to Elasticsearch for storage and analysis. It's powerful, gives us full control over our data, and is more cost-effective at our scale than a managed logging service. Metrics & Monitoring: For this, we decided not to reinvent the wheel. We use Datadog. The out-of-the-box dashboards, alerting, and deep integration with our cloud provider (AWS/GCP) save our small team hundreds of hours. The cost is justified by the engineering time we save. Traces: We're currently using Datadog's APM for tracing as well, as it's tightly integrated. However, we're actively exploring moving to OpenTelemetry for more vendor neutrality in the future. It's working out well. The key has been to be honest about our most valuable resource: engineering time. We self-host where we have a clear need for control (logs), and we pay for a service where the platform provides undeniable value and speed (metrics/monitoring). reply",

To buy (and keep) one, you have to be rich enough that a couple months' rent is nothing, self-confident (or socially oblivious) enough that you don't mind looking like a Star Wars droid knock-off, and masochistic enough to want to take your neck to the gym every time you want to watch a movie. Not a very big target audience... It's too heavy and limited to be a useful personal screen. It's useless for gaming. It's too expensive to be an occasional-use-only device. It's a solution to a problem nobody had, and it solves none of the problems people do have. Sure, it had a lot of fancy tech, and maybe made sense as a laboratory prototype, but not a consumer device. You can do more with the $300 Facebook goggles for 10% of the price, or get one of the pricier but slimmer AR glasses (Xreal, etc.) reply",

          "text": "> But to be fair similar-style criticisms were levied against the iPhone Really? That was a long time ago, but I don't remember that sort of criticism towards the iPhone... though maybe my memory is just foggy? It seemed to all happen so quick, with Google copying them with the G1 soon afterward, and then... well, the rest is history. The iPhone was a streamlined evolution of an existing niche (PalmPilots, Blackberries, Nokia Communicator, etc.). When I first heard about the Vision Pro, I really hoped that they made a much simpler, slimmed-down version of the Oculus, something more like the Xreal glasses. I was surprised when they went the other way instead, doubling down on all the extra-fancy tech that just added more bulk and expense. I don't think anyone ever thought, \"Man, the thing VR really needs? A scary recording of my eyes on the front.\" They somehow managed to find the nightmarish \"sweet spot\" between dorkiness and the uncanny valley, and then jacked up the price 3x-10x compared to all the other VR headsets... On the other hand, I do remember similar criticisms towards the first iPod, famously compared to the Nomad and other MP3 players of that time ( https://slashdot.org/story/01/10/23/1816257/apple-releases-i... )... is that what you're referring to? reply",

I work with a company who builds interactive educational experiences in VR and even they can't use it because it can't do basic things like accurately keep track of hand positioning or gestures (beyond pitch). Really the only use case for it is as a media device, but the price is way too high to buy it for that alone. If the hope was that businesses and developers were going to buy one and start developing an ecosystem around it then they probably should have made it more than a glorified 3D TV, or made it much cheaper so it was more widely accessible. I hear there's rumours they're going to add handsets soon though, so if they can do that while also bringing the price down a little that might help adoption a bit. reply",

With a price point that is too high for mass consumer adoption, it's no surprise it flopped in the retail market too.

I think that anything that is going to require humans to wear something on their head for entertainment purposes is not going to make it to mainstream. There will be niche uses and likely video games are a good niche. What is going to compel people to buy something like the Vision Pro when they already have smart phones that can do everything anyways?
