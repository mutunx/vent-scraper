Though sadly, I do not think we could trust all vendors to respect such a flag, so now it is all or nothing. Personally, I would select only training material for open models . Pandora's box is already open, but if we are going to have LLMs, I want them to be available to everyone and not gated by a small number of companies. Since open models generally have less of a benefit of scale in terms of GPUs, I want them to have the benefit of more available/higher quality training data. reply",

There isn't a single lab, company, person or country that doesn't use and benefit from open source. Whether they know it or not. It is what has supported widespread fractal improvement starting at the individual level. It's the greatest grassroots story movement ever and it's still driven by grassroot adoption. It's like programatic peer review writ large with no gate keeping journals and its changed humanity forever, if we ever deflect that asteroid headed towards earth or if we make it to the stars, or if we figure out how to avoid the heat death, it's because open source got us there. reply",

We have been stagnating for the last year. I tried many things to change the situation and I just don't want to keep going with him.<p>Now we have some investors, revenue, interns partnership agreement,etc.<p>Recently we let go of one of the late co-founders and we signed a new partnership agreement and I didn't check but it says that vesting period starts from like 6 months ago. Instead of 2.5 years.\nSo technically If I leave now I would loose everything.

So I simultaneously can tell you that its smart people really thinking about every facet of the problem, and I can't tell you much more than that. However I can share this written by my colleagues! You'll find great explanations about accelerator architectures and the considerations made to make things fast. https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/ In particular your questions are around inference which is the focus of this chapter https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/inference/ Edit:\nAnother great resource to look at is the unsloth guides. These folks are incredibly good at getting deep into various models and finding optimizations, and they're very good at writing it up.

So unlike training where you need to have memory coherence over something like 100k machines and somehow avoid the certainty of machine failure, you just need to route mostly small amounts of data to a bunch of big machines. I don't know what the specs of their inference machines are, but where I worked the machines research used were all 8gpu monsters. so long as your model fitted in (combined) vram, you could job was a goodun. To scale the secret ingredient was industrial amounts of cash. Sure we had DGXs (fun fact, nvidia sent literal gold plated DGX machines) but they wernt dense, and were very expensive. Most large companies have robust RPC, and orchestration, which means the hard part isn't routing the message, its making the model fit in the boxes you have.

The key advantage of doing batched inference at a huge scale is that once you maximize parallelism and sharding, your model parameters and the memory bandwidth associated with them are essentially free (since at any given moment they're being shared among a huge amount of requests!), you \"only\" pay for the request-specific raw compute and the memory storage+bandwidth for the activations.  And the proprietary models are now huge , highly-quantized extreme-MoE models where the former factor (model size) is huge and the latter (request-specific compute) has been correspondingly minimized - and where it hasn't, you're definitely paying \"pro\" pricing for it.  I think this goes a long way towards explaining how inference at scale can work better than locally. (There are \"tricks\" you could do locally to try and compete with this setup, such as storing model parameters on disk and accessing them via mmap, at least when doing token gen on CPU.  But of course you're paying for that with increased latency, which you may or may not be okay with in that context.) reply",

Plus the cache saves seconds of GPU time, so having an extra 100ms of latency is nothing compare to a cache miss. so a broad cache is much much better than a narrow local cache. But! even if its larger, Your bottleneck isn't the network, its waiting on the GPUs to be free[1].

          "text": "Google will win the LLM game if the LLM game is about compute , which is the common wisdom and maybe true, but not foreordained by God. There's an argument that if compute was the dominant term that Google would never have been anything but leading by a lot. Personally right now I see one clear leader and one group going 0-99 like a five sigma cosmic ray: Anthropic and the PRC. But this is because I believe/know that all the benchmarks are gamed as hell, its like asking if a movie star had cosmetic surgery. On quality, Opus 4 is 15x the cost and sold out / backordered. Qwen 3 is arguably in next place. In both of those cases, extreme quality expert labeling at scale (assisted by the tool) seems to be the secret sauce. Which is how it would play out if history is any guide: when compute as a scaling lever starts to flatten, you expert label like its 1987 and claim its compute and algorithms until the government wises up and stops treating your success persobally as a national security priority. It's the easiest trillion Xi Xianping ever made: pretending to think LLMs are AGI too, fast following for pennies on the dollar, and propping up a stock market bubble to go with the fentanyl crisis? 9-D chess. It's what I would do about AI if I were China. Time will tell. reply",

          "text": "TPUs are accelerators that accelerate the common operations found in neural nets. A big part is simply a massive number of matrix FMA units to process enormous matrix operations, which comprises the bulk of doing a forward pass through a model. Caching enhancements and massively growing memory was necessary to facilitate transformers, but on the hardware side not a huge amount has changed and the fundamentals from years ago still powers the latest models. The hardware is just getting faster and with more memory and more parallel processing units. And later getting more data types to enable hardware-enabled quantization. So it isn't like Google designed a TPU for a specific model or architecture. They're pretty general purpose in a narrow field (oxymoron, but you get the point). The set of operations Google designed into a TPU is very similar to what nvidia did, and it's about as broadly capable. But Google owns the IP and doesn't pay the premium and gets to design for their own specific needs. reply",

You can see a bit of that in the gif on the front page of the book. https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/ I also see how sometimes bad choices by me can make things inefficient. Luckily for me if my code/models are running slow I can ping colleagues who are able to debug at both a depth and speed that is quite incredible.

          "text": "I think the problem I see with this type of response is that it doesn't take into context the waste of resources involved.  If the 700M users per week is legitimate then my question to you is: how many of those invocations are worth the cost of resources that are spent, in the name of things that are truly productive? And if AI was truly the holy grail that it's being sold as then there wouldn't be 700M users per week wasting all of these resources as heavily as we are because generative AI would have already solved for something better.  It really does seem like these platforms are, and won't be, anywhere as useful as they're continuously claimed to be. Just like Tesla FSD, we keep hearing about a \"breakaway\" model and the broken record of AGI.  Instead of getting anything exceptionally better we seem to be getting models  tuned for benchmarks and only marginal improvements. I really try to limit what I'm using an LLM for these days.  And not simply because of the resource pigs they are, but because it's also often a time sink.  I spent an hour today testing out GPT-5 and asking it about a specific problem I was solving for using only 2 well documented technologies.  After that hour it had hallucinated about a half dozen assumptions that were completely incorrect. One so obvious that I couldn't understand how it had gotten it so wrong. This particular technology, by default, consumes raw SSE. But GPT-5, even after telling it that it was wrong, continued to give me examples that were in a lot of ways worse and kept resorting to telling me to validate my server responses were JSON formatted in a particularly odd way. Instead of continuing to waste my time correcting the  model I just went back to reading the docs and GitHub issues to figure out the problem I was solving for.  And that led me down a dark chain of thought: so what happens when the \"teaching\" mode rethinks history, or math fundamentals? I'm sure a lot of people think ChatGPT is incredibly useful. And a lot of people are bought into not wanting to miss the boat, especially those who don't have any clue to how it works and what it takes to execute any given prompt.  I actually think LLMs have a trajectory that will be similar to social media.  The curve is different and I, hopefully, don't think we've seen the most useful aspects of it come to fruition as of yet. But I do think that if OpenAI is serving 700M users per week then, once again, we are the product.  Because if AI could actually displace workers en masse today you wouldn't have access to it for $20/month. And they wouldn't offer it to you at 50% off for the next 3 months when you go to hit the cancel button. In fact, if it could do most of the things executives are claiming then you wouldn't have access to it at all. But, again, the users are the product - in very much the same way social media played into. Finally, I'd surmise that of those 700M weekly users less than 10%  of those sessions are being used for anything productive that you've mentioned and I'd place a high wager that the 10% is wildly conservative.  I could be wrong, but again - we'd know about that if it were the actual truth. reply",

When doing automations that are perfectly handled by deterministic systems why would I put the outcomes of those in the hands of a non-deterministic one? And at that cost differential? We know a few things: LLMs are not efficient, LLMs are consuming more water than traditional compute, we know the providers know but they haven't shared any tangible metrics, and the build process involves, also, an exceptional amount of time, wattage and water. For me it's: if you have access to a supercomputer do you use it to tell you a joke or work on a life saving medicine? We didn't have these tools 5 years ago. 5 years ago you dealt with said \"drudgery\".  On the other hand you then say it can't do \"most things I do\".  It seems as though the lines of fatalism and paradox are in full force for a lot of the arguments around AI. I think the real kicker for me this week (and it changes week-over-week, which is at least entertaining) is when Paul Graham told his Twitter feed [1] a \"hotshot\" programmer is writing 10k LOC that are not \"bug-filled crap\" in 12 hours. That's 14 LOC per minute . Compared to industry norms of 50-150 LOC per 8 hour day . Apparently,this \"hot-shot\" is not \"naive\", though, implying that it's most definitely legit.

The stuff I'm punting isn't stuff I can automate.

On the other hand you then say it can't do \"most things I do\". I'm not sure why you think this is paradoxical. I probably eliminate 20-30% of tasks at this point with AI.  Honestly, it probably does these tasks better than I would (not better than I could , but you can't give maximum effort on everything).  As a result, I get 30-40% more done, and a bigger proportion of it is higher value work. And, AI sometimes helps me with stuff that I -can't- do, like making a good illustration of something. It doesn't surpass top humans at this stuff, but it surpasses me and probably even where I can get to with reasonable effort . reply",

A human eats 2000 kilocalories of food per day. Thus, sitting around for an hour to do a task takes 350kJ of food energy.  Depending on what people eat, it's 350kJ to 7000kJ of fossil fuel energy in to get that much food energy.  In the West, we eat a lot of meat, so expect the high end of this range. The low end-- 350kJ-- is enough to answer 100-200 ChatGPT requests.  It's generous, too, because humans also have an amortized share of sleep and non-working time, other energy inputs/uses to keep them alive, eat fancier food, use energy for recreation, drive to work, etc. Shoot, just lighting their part of the room they sit in is probably 90kJ. > I am not an anti-LLM’er here but having models that are this power hungry and this generalisable makes no sense economically in the long term.

          "text": "Reading your two comments in conjunction - I find your take reasonable, so I apologise for jumping the gun and going knee first in my previous comment. It was early where I was, but should be no excuse. I feel like if you're going to go down the route of the energy consumption needed to sustain the entire human organism, you have to do that on the other side as well - as the actual activation cost of human neurons and articulating fingers to operate a keyboard won't be in that range - but you went for the low ball so I'm not going to argue that, as you didn't argue some of the other stuff that sustains humans. But I will argue the wider implication of your comment that a like-for-like comparison is easy - it's not, so leaving it in the neuron activation space energy cost would probably be simpler to calculate, and there you'd arrive at a smaller ChatGPT ratio. More like 10-20, as opposed to 100-200. I will concede to you that economies of scale mean that there's an energy efficiency in sustaining a ChatGPT workforce compared to a human workforce, if we really want to go full dystopian, but that there's also outsized energy inefficiency in needing the industry and using the materials to construct a ChatGPT workforce large enough to sustain the economies of scale, compared to humans which we kind of have and are stuck with. There is a wider point that ChatGPT is less autonomous than an assistant, as no matter the tenure with it, you'll not give it the level of autonomy that a human assistant would have as it would self correct to a level where you'd be comfortable with that. So you need a human at the wheel, which will spend some of that human brain power and finger articulation, so you have to add that to the scale of the ChatGPT workflow energy cost. Having said all that - you make a good point with MoE - but the router activation is inefficient; and the experts are still outsized to the processing required to do the task at hand - but what I argue is that this will get better with further distillation, specialisation and better routing however only for economically viable task pathways. I think we agree on this, reading between the lines. I would argue though (but this is an assumption, I haven't seen data on neuron activation at task level) that for writing a command-line tool, the neurons still have to activate in a sufficiently large manner to parse a natural language input, abstract it and construct formal language output that will pass the parsers. So you would be spending a higher range of energy than for an average Chat GPT task In the end - you seem to agree with me that the current unit economics are unsustainable, and we'll need three processes to make them sustainable - cost going up, efficiency going up and usefulness going up. Unless usefulness goes up radically (which it won't due to scaling limitations of LLM's), full autonomy won't be possible, so the value of the additional labour will need to be very marginal to a human, which - given the scaling laws of GPU's - doesn't seem likely. Meanwhile - we're telling the masses at large to get on with the programme, without considering that maybe for some classes of tasks it just won't be economically viable; which creates lock in and might be difficult disentangle in the future. All because we must maintain the vibes that this technology is more powerful than it actually is. And that frustrates me, because there's plenty pathways where it's obvious it will be viable, and instead of doubling down on those, we insist on generalisability. reply",

IDK.  I didn't give human entry level employees that much autonomy.  ChatGPT runs off and does things for a minute or two consuming thousands and thousands of tokens, which is a lot like letting someone junior spin for several hours. Indeed, the cost is so low -- better to let it \"see its vision through\" than to interrupt it.  A lot of the reason why I'd manage junior employees closely are to A) contain costs, and B) prevent discouragement.  Neither of those apply here. (And, you know -- getting the thing back while I remember exactly what I asked and still have some context to rapidly interpret the result-- this is qualitatively different from getting back work from a junior employee hours later). > that maybe for some classes of tasks it just won't be economically viable; Running an LLM is expensive.  But it's expensive in the sense \"serving a human costs about the same as a long distance phone call in the 90's.\"  And the vast majority of businesses did not worry about what they were expending on long distance too much . And the cost can be expected to decrease, even though the price will go up from \"free.\"  I don't expect it will go up too high; some players will have advantages from scale and special sauce to make things more efficient, but it's looking like the barriers to entry are not that substantial.",

As someone mentioned on another AI thread, if AI is so good why aren't people just doing 15 PRs a day on open source projects like Node.js, React, Kubernetes, Linux, Ansible, etc? AI is sometimes a productivity booster for a dev, sometimes not. And it's unpredictable when it will and won't be. It's not great at giving you confidence signals when you should be skeptical of its output. In any sufficiently complex software project, as much of the development is about domain knowledge, asking the right questions, balancing resources, guarding against risks, interfacing with a team to scope and vet and iterate on a feature, managing resources, analyzing customer feedback, thinking of new features, improving existing features, etc. When AI is a productivity booster, it's great, but modern software is an evolving, organic product, that requires a team to maintain, expand, improve, etc. As of yet, no AI can take the place of that. reply",

But the study happened, and it is clear: experienced developers are the ones that suffered from using LLMs. > but it's just illogical for a junior to get benefits and the seniors don't Experienced car drivers won't benefit from a youtube tutorial how to drive, junior car drivers might. That's similar to\njunior developers being potentially the ones who can benefit from the basic things that an LLM can help you with, e.g helping you with syntax and structure your thoughts and write a scaffold to get you started. Those are concerns that experienced developers don't need help with, similarly how experienced drivers don't need youtube tutorials how to shift a gear. There is nothing illogical in that premise. Do you agree? > i don't think i can do better than the LLM I most certainly can tell you that there are 1000s of developers that can do infinitely better than any of the current LLMs, and those developers are fairly often senior.

There are reasons that seasoned OSS developers reject AI PRs: https://news.itsfoss.com/curl-ai-slop/ (like the creator of curl). Additionally, the only study to date currently measuring the impact on LLMs on experienced developers found a modest 19% decline in productivity when using an LLM for their daily work. https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-o... Now we can ponder behind the reasons that the study showed experienced developers get a decrease of productivity, and you anecdotally experience a boost of \"productivity\", but why think about things when we can ask an LLM? - experienced developers -> measured decrease of productivity - you -> perceived increase of productivity Here is what ChatGPT-5 thinks about the potential reason (AI slop below): \"Why You Might Feel More Productive If senior developers are seeing a decline in productivity, but you are experiencing the opposite, it stands to reason that you are more junior. Here are some reasons why LLMs might help junior developers like you to feel more productive: Lower Barrier to Entry - LLMs help fill in gaps in knowledge—syntax, APIs, patterns—so you can move faster without constantly Googling or reading docs. - Confidence Boost You get instant feedback, suggestions, and explanations. That can make you feel more capable and reduce hesitation. - Acceleration of Learning You’re not just coding—you’re learning as you go. LLMs act like a tutor, speeding up your understanding of concepts and best practices. - More Output, Less Friction You might be producing more code, solving more problems, and feeling that momentum—especially if you are just starting your coding journey.\" reply",

Now that we can use Copilot, we have a new CIO and I don’t hear about it so much. There is still some AI hype, but it’s more about how it’s being used in our products, rather than how to use it internally to do the work. Apparently sometime in the next year we’re getting a new version of Jira with some AI that can do user stories on its own, but I don’t see that changing much of anything. The bottleneck has rarely been the actual writing of code, it’s been people making decisions and general bureaucracy. AI isn’t solving that. Copilot has also not impressed anyone on my team. As far as the code we work on, it’s pretty bad. There are a few niche things it helps with, mostly writing queries to pull values out of complex json. That saves a little time, but hardly 30-50%. More like 1-2%. Management stopped giving us new people, while pressuring us to do more, for many years now. This was a trend long before AI and I haven’t noticed any major change.

          "text": "Its a nice productivity and capability boost that feels on the same magnitude as, for example, React. The \"dream\" of it being able to just take tickets and agentically get a PR up for review is possible for ~5% of tickets. That goes up to ~10% if your organization has no standards at all, including even a self-serving standard like \"at least make sure the repository remains useful to future AI usage\". My organization would still hire as many software engineers as we could afford. - Stack Overflow has to be actually dead at this point. There's no reason to go there, or even Google, anymore. - Using it for exploratory high level research and summarization into unfamiliar repos is pretty nice. - Very rarely does AI write code that I feel would last a year without needing to be rewritten. That makes it good for things like knocking out a quick script or updating a button color. - None of them actually follow instructions e.g. in Cursor rules. Its a serious problem. It doesn't matter how many times or where I tell it \"one component per file, one component per file\", all caps, threaten its children, offer it a cookie, it just does whatever it wants. reply",

It used to be simple to ask questions and get answers, when it grew and the huge influx of questions required moderation it was a nice smooth change but over time the pearl clutching of mods to mark many reasonable questions as irrelevant started to grip the usefulness. I used to answer a lot of the basic questions just to help others as I've felt I had been helped, the moderation shift applying more and more rules started to make me feel unwelcomed to ask questions and even to answer. I do understand why it happened, with the influx of people trying to game the platform to show off in their resumés they were at the \"top\" of whatever buzzword was hot in the industry at the time but it still affected me as a contributing user out of kindness. By 2018 I would not even login to vote or add comments, and I feel it was already going on a slow downhill path, and LLMs will definitely kill it. We will definitely suffer, SO has been an incredible resource to figure out things not covered well in documentation, I remember when proper experts (i.e. maintainers of libraries/frameworks) would jump in to answer about a weird edge case, or clarify the usage of a feature, explain why it was misuse, etc. Right now I don't see anything else that will provide this knowledge to LLMs, in 10-20 years time there will be a lot missing in training datasets, and it will be a slow degradation of knowledge available in the open for us all to learn from. reply",

          "text": "I find AI helpful when coding in unfamiliar languages or topics, as it generates initial code that roughly works, that I can then iterate on. Even so, I have to constantly hound the AI to write concise code, to reuse code, to consolidate duplicate code blocks. When I ask it to remove the useless comments, it also removes the useful comments, so I have to goad it back into adding back individual helpful comments. I had AI write some Python unit tests and it showed me how to mock, which I had never done in Python. That's great! But when I examined the tests, they were so \"white box\" and brittle that almost any change in implementation would break the tests. When coding in a familiar language (C++), I tried turning on the auto-AI assistant (for our one project where security rules allowed it) and while I was impressed that it would auto-complete whole blocks of text based on my actual code base, not once was I able to accept those blocks as-is. So for me at this point AI is at best a net +2% productivity improvement, though I surely have lots to learn about other ways in which it could be useful. reply",

If AI gets to a point where it is equal to a good/senior developer we'll have to see.

          "text": "AI has drastically changed how I make decisions about code and how I code in general. I get less bogged down with boilerplate code and issues, which makes me more efficient and allows me to enjoy architecting more. Additionally, I have found it extremely helpful in writing lower-level code from scratch rather than relying on plug-and-play libraries with questionable support. For example, why use a SQLite abstraction library when I can use LLMs to interact directly with the C source code? Sure it’s more lines of code, but I control everything. I wouldn’t have had the time before. This has also been extremely helpful in embedded systems and low-level Bluetooth. In terms of hiring- I co-own a small consultancy. I just hired a sub to help me while on parental leave with some UI work. AI isn’t going to help my team integrate, deploy, or make informed decision while I’m out. Side note, with a newborn (sleeping on me at this moment), I can make real meaningful edits to my codebase pretty much on my phone. Then review, test, integrate when I have the time. It’s amazing, but I still feel you have to know what you are doing, and I am selective on what tasks, and how to split them up. I also throw away a lot of generated code, same as I throw away a lot of my first iterations, it’s all part of the process. I think saying “AI is going X% of my work” is the wrong attitude. I’m still doing work when I use AI, it’s just different. That statement kind of assumes you are blindly shipping robot code, which sounds horrible and zero fun. reply",

Yes you can move the abstraction one level up, but you don't control it if you nor the LLM meet the level of accumulated knowledge that is embedded in this abstraction.

Start building stuff the way you would by yourself, but then start delegating the repetitive tasks to an agent. My best recommendations would be using Cursor in Agent mode, and switching to VScode in Agent mode when your credits with Cursor run out. The reason why I like Cursor more is because of the Checkpoints. And VScode Copilot Agent checkpoints suck; but you can still use git to create your own checkpoints (git add / git stash, etc). I don't even use completions, really just agent mode. I do planning, wireframing, creating specs all with agents. Even small MVPs created in 5 minutes, deployed in 10, during a meeting to just brainstorm. As for the models. Go with Claude 3.5 or 4.0, GPT5. Use sequentialthinking and Taskmaster MCP. I could write a book about it... but the best way to go about it is to dive into, get frustrated, push through and then learn it the hard way. I started delegating a lot of my programming work the day ChatGPT came out; just copy and pasting, and since that day, my reliance on AI has just been increasing, and I have been getting better at it (and now I am at this stage.. with 2 PMS). reply",

I was still excited quite a while, until I slowly understood all the limitations that come with LLMs. We can not trust them, and this is one of the fundamental problems: verifying things takes a long time, sometimes its even faster just writing the code yourself. We do have non-core-product tasks that can greatly benefit from AI, but that is already a small part of our job. I did find two areas where LLMs are very useful: generatin documentation from code (mermaidjs is useful here) and parsing GDB output! Seriously, parsing GDB output was like an epiphany. I was for real blown away by it. It correctly generated a very detailed explanation of what kind of overwriting was happening when I happened to use a wild pointer. Its so good at seeing patterns, even combining data from several overwritten variables and parsing what was written there. I could have done it myself, but I seldom do such deep analysis in GDB and it did it in literally 10 seconds. Sadly, it was not that terribly useful this time, but I do feel that in the future GDB+AI is a winning concept. But at the same time, I spend very little time in GDB per year. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I recently came across a comment [0] here that highlighted the challenges of building native desktop apps with LLMs. The commenter pointed out how scarce training resources have become—few blog posts, tutorials, or open-source projects exist compared to web or mobile development. They also noted that while desktop app development was a solid career path in the 90s, it's now seen as a dead end for most, outside of big players like Microsoft or Adobe.<p>This got me thinking: My own experience with desktop development dates back to the late 90s using Turbo Pascal 6 in Delphi, and I'm out of the loop on modern practices. With the evolving landscape, I'm curious about what tools and workflows developers are actually using today.<p>Some questions to spark discussion:<p>- What programming languages and frameworks are popular for desktop apps?\n- Are there any go-to IDEs, build tools, or libraries that make development easier?\n- Do the above answers change if you care about code performance or efficiency (whatever that means to you)?\n- Is native desktop app development still viable as a career, or are most greenfield projects shifting to web-based alternatives?<p>I'd love to hear from folks with recent experience—success stories, pitfalls, and recommendations would be great. Thanks in advance for sharing!<p>[0] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44841291\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44841291</a></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I have been evaluating and testing the Filesystem API for a local first web based CAD editor and having direct r/w access to the filesystem is a great way to make such a thing, couple with the FilesystemObserver[1] API this makes building proper editors on the web a breeze. In place of this, Firefox recommends using the origin private file system (OPFS)[2] which is basically a sandboxed filesystem that the users cannot access. Though I agree from a security perspective it kind of makes sense (not particularly for my usecase), but it removes the ability for the user to have realtime changes on local files. An example of this is using the web based tool as an intermediary step or a processing step in a bigger pipeline; I save it using my web tool and then native applications automatically handle file updates.\nThis just creates an extra step for Firefox/Safari to replicate changes locally by having to manually update local files. Also neither Firefox nor Safari support showDirectoryPicker() which also creates blocks for building a web based editor. I love Firefox and I hope they can add support for this. I have stopped caring about Safari/Webkit completely because it's hellish to try and maintain feature parity while NOT sacrificing innovation and ease of use.

          "text": "At work we use C#, .Net, and WPF.  I've only used it at this company, and I can't say for sure if my dislikes are with WPF, or how our codebase is using it.  Overall it's not terrible, except for being proprietary and Windows only. Outside of work, I'm out in left field using Common Lisp for most of my projects, so I'm not sure how helfpul this is, but... In the past, I used Qt4 because there was an amazing Common Lisp binding and it worked well on Linux, FreeBSD and OSX.  It's increasingly hard to use Qt4 any more, though, and changes in the Qt project made the technique used by the Qt4 bindings impractical for Qt5 or Qt6 - at least that was my understanding when I looked into it. For newer things I've tried LTK but don't really like the looks of it and I wouldn't say it's \"modern\".  It seems to work across platform well enough, though, and for simple stuff it's okay. More often than not I'm using a combination of the Slime tools in Emacs in combination with an GLFW/OpenGL window.  Often I'll use the inspector to display data and make changes that show up in an OpenGL window, or run some commands in the REPL and pop up an image in an external viewer or load something in a browser.  It only works for certain types of applications, and I won't even pretend it's practical for end users, but it works pretty well, and it's flexible as a developer. I'm curious to see what other people say.  It's been a while since I madea full blown GUI application. reply",

          "text": "Topping my list of GUI toolkit requirements are cross-platform and native look & feel. As far as I know, Qt still beats everything else in these areas on the desktop. It's mostly excellent. However, I find The Qt Group's commercial licensing (and their tactics as reported by various people on HN) a little scary. If I were to go commercial, I think I would stick with LGPL Qt and link dynamically or give customers my object files for re-linking, because I get the impression that accepting a commercial Qt license could restrict my ability to use open-source Qt elsewhere. I suppose there might be some other way to safely navigate those waters, but from what I've read, The Qt Group has a reputation for making this far from hassle-free. It's not an immediate problem because I currently use Qt only for open-source and personal tools. I have grown tired of C++, so I've been using Python to drive Qt. The bindings are very good, mirroring the C++ API so closely that I just use the C++ docs when I need to look something up. I've also been watching for Qt bindings to other compiled languages, mainly for distributing non-Linux GUI apps more simply than Python allows. Such bindings often turn out to expose only Qt Quick, which lacks functionality that I sometimes need, but there are a few that expose Qt Widgets. For example, these Go bindings: https://github.com/mappu/miqt I hope we'll eventually see a cross-platform GUI toolkit rivaling Qt in a language more pleasant than C++ (and ideally easier to bind to other languages). The one being developed for internal use by the Zed editor has some promising ideas about how to render native-looking text, which I think is a good start: https://zed.dev/blog/videogame https://www.gpui.rs/ reply",

It's not just a single hermetically sealed box. This part comes from one supplier, this part from another. Both can be modified, and require different skills to modify. 2. You start from day 1 to take baby steps in thinking about whom to trust. Here there are 2 separate projects that would be very hard to collude together.

          "text": "Delphi was so ahead of its time (a mandatory remark)... I've used Delphi 1 to 4  then moved on to other things. Using .NET since 1.0 beta, and it still remains my favorite stack. The project I am currently building is a software infra for building E2EE applications, and it requires a little bit of everything - mobile apps for key management, desktop/cli apps/client libraries for actually encrypting data, sometimes a web based app, and a zero trust backend. Using Xamarin/MAUI for mobile apps, Blazor WASM for Web, Blazor Hybrid / MAUI / Avalonia UI for Desktop. All of the frameworks have their quirks, so it may take a bit of time to learn your patterns, build your base classes, but after that you pretty much enjoy the productivity of a modern high level language. - What programming languages and frameworks are popular for desktop apps?\n- for me - Blazor Hybrid / MAUI / Avalonia UI / WinForms - Are there any go-to IDEs, build tools, or libraries that make development easier?\n- I use MSVS 2022, VSCode for .NET, IntelliJ for $$$ at work. There are of course UI control libraries, I am using MudBlazor for Blazor WASM / Hybrid, other than that I use built-in controls that come with each framework. I try to use as little as possible of 3rd party libraries b/c my apps are security-sensitive. - Do the above answers change if you care about code performance or efficiency (whatever that means to you)? \n- in my case no, I am able to find what I need in .NET ecosystem. Modern .NET supports ahead-of-time compilation compiling to native code, and that helps to reduce start-up time which is important for Desktop / CLI. Ironically, for a long running processes, like a web service, the just-in-time compilation sometimes produces code running faster than ahead-of-time compilation, b/c it learns most common execution paths at runtime, and is able to recompile on the fly, optimizing for most frequent execution paths, giving a non-trivial performance boost in some cases - Is native desktop app development still viable as a career, or are most greenfield projects shifting to web-based alternatives\n- depends on the app/use case. For my project, desktop is the first class citizen, but I am building E2EE apps, i.e. end-to-end-encryption apps, aka client-side encryption, and native / Desktop / CLI is a better fit for E2EE in most of the cases compared to web apps. For those Web apps that I have it is still E2EE but in the browser (still client side encryption) reply",

This isn't 100% reliable but is useful as a first pass (where a human can investigate further) or a backstop (against a human missing something important and obvious but buried in a long file or huge volume of files). I also put together a half-baked web extension to try to steer the Youtube algorithm. It basically scrolls through shorts and tries to watch+like high quality content and skip+dislike junk (and worse) to scrub it out of the feed as much as possible. It's only looking at the transcript and a couple of thumbnails, so it's not super accurate, but in the short term it's been working pretty well. I figure that Google can probably tell that it's not a human though, and might disregard its inputs (or ban me) in the long term.  Time will tell. reply",

That’s my trade, but lots of HNers have more interesting trades than that.<p>In my case, only recently I learned the value of getting an LLM to write and refine a plan.md architecture doc first, and for it to break that doc down into testable phases, and then to implement phase by phase.<p>Seems obvious in hindsight. But it took too long to learn that that should be my approach. I had been going phase by phase myself- no overarching plan.md for the LLM.<p>What Trick of the Trade took you too long to learn?</p></p></p></div>",

This provides the next person an understanding of why the code looks as it does, and if it should be changed at this new moment in time, when perhaps new hardware is available.

It can bring experiences with family members and friends. Having $1 million in the bank in 40 years will never buy back time you may have wasted working to save that money. I'm not saying that people shouldn't save or invest money for the long term, but I do think more people should take into account what they lose today by only focusing on the long term...

You can just try out new things temporarily.  Take your sofa example.  If you choose to just try a different arrangement of furniture for a short time, that gives you can opportunity to remember to replace the sofa.  The hard part is being willing to experiment with changes, but I find that it reframes things from fixing an old problem to trying something new, which can be more exciting and motivate additional improvements. reply",

What's the risk that it will actually cost more, considering various ranges of potential numbers (and distributions)? I think it's harder to apply to software since there are more unknowns (or the unknowns are fatter-tailed) but I still liked the book just for the philosophical framing at the beginning: you want to the measure things because they help you make decisions; you don't need perfect measurements since reducing the range of uncertainty is often enough to make the decision. reply",

          "text": "A simple example that highlights the strength of this method: a 137Cs point source is at the origin. A detector consisting of a right cylinder at arbitrary distance and orientation is nearby. What is the solid angle? There may exist an analytical solution for this, but I wouldn't trust myself to derive it correctly. It would certainly be a huge mess. If we add that the source is also a right cylinder instead of point source, and we want to add first order attenuation of emitted gammas by the source itself, the spreadsheet becomes only a bit more complex, but there will not be a pen and paper equation solution. In this example every row of the spreadsheet would represent a hypothetical ray. One could randomly choose a location in the source, a random trajectory, and check if the photon intersects the detector. An alternative approach would be randomly choosing points in both target and detector, then doing additional math. The results are recovered by making histograms and computing stats on the outputs of all the rows. You probably need a few thousand for most things at least. Remember roughly speaking 10k hits gets you ~1% statistics. reply",

          "text": "What annoys me with Monte Carlo methods is trying to get self-consistent statistics at multiple parameter values. E.g., in your example, what is the derivative of the solid angle as the detector is moved? Or more generally, if we have some 'net goodness' measure for a system depending on parameters, how can we efficiently maximize it, when simulations are noisy and basins are shallow? My understanding is that these sorts of questions come up in ML, and there are ways of dealing with it, but they can't converge nearly as fast as simple iterations like Newton's method. Even if I have to take a series approximation instead of a simple formula, I'll be able to use autodiff (or at worst, symbolic differentiation) to get quick and precise answers to these questions. reply",

When I worked at the USPTO, I used the less popular database Dialog, which I preferred. To my knowledge, none of these are available direct to consumers. I've only been able to get access from places with subscriptions. Some university libraries allow visitors where you can use these databases for free on-site. I would call these databases complementary, not \"entirely superior\". There are two main advantages. One is that these databases will contain many things that you can't find on Google. The second advantage of these databases is that they are designed for advanced searchers and have more powerful query languages. Google on the other hand is dumbed down and will try to guess what you want, often doing a poor job. You can get very specific on these databases in ways that you can't with Google. Related: I'm somewhat fascinated by more specialized bibliographic databases because they often contain things that can't be found on Google or the major commercial databases I listed above.

It's easy to say that quick-and-dirty is just dirty, and it's true: in the long run, quick-and-dirty takes longer than the-right-thing. But, there is a but: time doesn't always have the same value! Time just before a deadline is much more precious than the time after the deadline, when you can relax a bit and fix things before the next stress wave.

I tested all I could find, LiteTracker seems the best, but still extremely buggy even in the initial demo project changing task status fails. The rest appears either half-finished, untrustworthy or has a very sketchy interface. But would really like to be surprised.<p>I am very rarely willing to pay for software and this is one case I really want to, but cannot find anything.<p>This thing kinda feeds my pet theory that the art of making functional software has been lost by late 2010s. People say Linear is fast but it's nothing compared to how well Pivotal worked. Any half-skilled indie dev could have made a killing on making a good replacement, but no one has been able to?</p></p></p></div>",

The product, itself, was plagued by being in a split-brain reality of Backbone and React (we were migrating as much as possible to React). We never addressed performance low-hanging fruit for large projects and it’s because it affected relatively few customers. That said, pairing has its ups and downs. I think as other folks have said, you miss out on being able to go deep on problems that require ruminating. You also lack overarching reviews that help to keep architecture clean.

I just retested all of them and it really seems none are fully usable. I also see few improvements since April, it seems many of the teams either burned out trying to finish in time, were overwhelmed seeing what it really takes to make the details work after the fun parts are over or were disappointed seeing how low user numbers are from direct switchers. I disagree with your 2010 theory, back then it would have been even less fruitful to make a viable alternative with the limited time and resources available. Especially as things like the UI state handling and some of the architecture was unheard of back then, years ahead of its time and even linear now does not fully match many aspects. Similarly \"Any half-skilled indie dev could have made a killing on making a good replacement\" is just wrong, \na) you need to be a really great developer to make something that even nearly matches PT, there is more than is obvious to someone not deeply familiar with the internals of the product and 15 year of refinements that went into it. A few of the cloning teams were some of these indie developers who thought it would be fun and easy which was obviously very naive. b) \"Make a killing\" is equally misleading. I would be surprised if its possible at all to break even on something like a pure PT clone. There are maybe 200 original users who are super loud and \"in love\" but this can easily mislead to thinking there are millions of users that would be immediately jump on and start paying. It takes probably 2 orders of magnitude more addressable market to make the financials work just by providing a PT clone (Which is why lanes.pm is focusing on making what tracker would need to be today not just catching up on what it was.) Just give it a bit more time, there are at least 2 teams including lanes working on this and we all decided not to launch something half baked and buggy that loses your data. reply",

          "text": "My biggest issue with Linear is that it doesn't think about cycles the way Pivotal did sprints.  Or more accurately, it's in what PT called \"commit mode\" all the time. If your cycle ends with a bunch of work undone, it rolls into the next cycle.  If that cycle already a full capacity of work planned, well, now your cycle is at 150% or whatever.  Repeat.  The solution, presumably, is to stop creating new cycles. But what PT would do, and seamlessly at that, is rebalance the sprints.  Your project manager wants to move a number of stories to the top of the backlog?  Great, but now that item projected for three sprints out is now four sprints out.  The velocity and the projections were extracted from reality, not mandated from on high. I asked Linear if they could add this -- a cycle rebalance.  I was told, no, this simply isn't something they want to do, but maybe I could do it with zapier.  Trying to get them to understand why I wanted this was like trying to explain air to a fish.  It simply did not compute. reply",

It will be a Python project that will access Microsoft cloud using the Graph 1.0 API.<p>One advantage of the situation is that this project is a bit standalone and I don't have to feed it 2000 already existing classes from an existing legacy codebase to give it a context to work with.<p>What would you recommend me?<p>Are there any dark patterns involved, e.g. de-facto un-cancellable subscriptions that will make me cancel my card instead?<p>I would be happy hearing your experience and tales from the battlefield.</p></p></p></p></p></div>",

This is probably the most important thing you can do to drive better results. As you work, try to ensure you're getting independently testable steps as you solve a problem. Take time planning, always have it reference your CLAUDE.md and existing code patterns. At the end of each step, I have CC determine whether or not to update the CLAUDE.md if there's any foundational updates. The trick is to have a idea of what you're expecting out of these tools. If you can use the tool to break down the work into individual pieces you will find it is really fun and productive way to build software. You still have to think, but you are able to cover a lot more ground faster. I can't type out 4 files that are in my brain in 10 seconds. reply",

          "text": "Not in SF, but talked to a number of Canadian founders when I worked in VC. It depends on your financial/legal situation, those of your co-founders(if any), and what types of \"returns\" you are referring to by ROI. 1) The obvious benefit is to get plugged into the network there. You don't need to be there all the time to accomplish this. Waterloo, and Canada in general, is still cheaper COL wise compared to Bay area/NYC etc, so it'll help with your burn rate to build in Waterloo. Most people's burn rate at least doubled when they move themselves or their team. Flying in every few months could be enough. 2) If you're convinced you need to move to the Bay area, it might be useful to incorporate your business in the US and look at your visa options. I think there's a regular Ask HN about immigration issues. You likely need to do this anyways if you're fundraising in the US. The typical setup is some sort of Delaware corp with a Canadian subsidiary, if needed. IANAL and you should get professional advice here. 3) Get married to a US citizen and your personal visa issues will be solved lol. reply",

Once people see the screws had Loctite applied they will find more alternatives and revive older transports protocols.  Usenet is still the vastly superior medium for automatically sharing massive amounts of multimedia content if one filters on pre-shared subjects preshared secrets, GPG signed messages. The spam can be entirely and automagically ignored. My personal preference will always be anonymous Chroot SFTP and people using the LFTP client with the mirror subsystem and SFTP to split up batch jobs and individual files into multiple TCP streams.  It works like rsync but much better as long as there are not massive numbers of nested sub-directories.   LFTP+SFTP+mirror can easily max out any fiber connection but can also be rate limited with very granular controls.  It's great for small circles of friends being significantly more secure and private.  It's also super easy to automate uploads and downloads via cron.  For even greater anonymity friends can build their own Tinc VPN mesh open source in a multi-star configuration so people do not see each others IP addresses.  Internet bots don't even know what to do with anonymous chroot sftp and that's assuming I leave it on the default port. reply",

It worked, as long as the influx of people was small enough that they could learn how to behave. And then the masses got onto the Internet. Lookup the term \"Eternal September\" [1]. The whole culture got overwhelmed by people that did not value the medium. Spam got out of hand, trolling was a most popular pastime. That killed Usenet, as normal discussion was impossible. Can Usenet be revived? Not while there is money to be made on the Internet. Any attempt to gather people online gets perverted by someone smelling money. Usenet was great until the mid-nineties.

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">If you are a parent like me, perhaps you'll understand this. My kids spend way too much time on their phones.<p>As we start the new school year, I want to add a \"land line\" to my house so I can tell them \"devices are off at 8:30! If you urgently need to make a call, go ahead and use this land line.\"<p>I am hopeful this will mean they don't \"just need to text someone\" and then get sucked into the void of their smart phone addictions until all hours of the night, damaging their fragile sleep patterns.<p>Of course, I don't really want a land line. I want a SIP phone that connects via Plivo or Twilio. I've been looking on eBay and others to find an inexpensive cordless version that I can easily connect to Plivo.<p>I'm confused, however, what the difference is between a SIP phone, a DECT phone, Bluetooth and a WiFi phone, and if those can all be used with Plivo/Twilio.<p>For example this link:<p>https://www.voipsupply.com/voip-phones/cordless<p>Anyone have suggestions on going down this path? Do I need to run a PBX on one of my machines?<p>I figure the least expensive way is just direct to Plivo. The pay-as-you-go plan seems to be about $0.005 a minute inbound, $0.01 a minute outbound. That's easily worth my sanity.<p>https://www.plivo.com/pricing/</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Anecdotal evidence: - Github, Facebook, and Reddit have never been unseated - Instagram has never been replaced, only supplemented - Twitter/X has only lost steam due to extremely bad press, an unwanted name change, and a huge effort from Meta (which leveraged traffic and synergy from Instagram). And even then, it's still well within the public zeitgeist. Bluesky and Mastodon didn't even make dents. - Google has never been displaced (granted, Google pays a lot of money to maintain defaults and maintain a web \"pane of glass\" monopoly, redefine the address bar as a search bar, etc.) reply",

          "text": "I'm using srctree https://srctree.gr.ht/repo/srctree Hopefully you'll forgive me for shilling my own project. It's a source code sharing site with a few primary goals. First, don't break the back button. I started the project right around the time github broke too many critical features in short succession. The back button, the URL bar, and ctrl+f in the code view. I also want it to be easy to use as a federated collaboration tool. Ideally you'd start your own instance locally, get a familiar GitHub like interface for submitting patches anywhere, even by email. Or if you're hosting a project, you could have an always up instance that others could connect to. The part I've been thinking about deeply the past few days is how to improve the discoverability of peer repos and forks. I want to create something github like in terms of collaboration, but also try to incorporate some of the best lessons from mailing list based repos where it's easy to grab and try patchsets (exposed as branches) from a 'fork' without losing the value of a cannon 'upstream' and without insisting that any specific upstream is where every single commit belongs. The whole thing is written in zig without any dependencies other than git for some of the repo management features I haven't ported yet. (and for generating git blames) If you do use it, or notice any issues, or think it's missing features do let me know. I'm currently trying to decide which is the next most important thing to hack on :) see also https://github.com/GrayHatter/srctree if you want to subscribe to updates (still a feature srctree lacks lol) reply",

What does and does not make it into Gogs (it's still around) is ultimately decided by one person, and he's fairly conservative. Gogs is very fast but lacks a lot of features that would allow it to go head-to-head with GitHub or Gitlab. So, Gitea was forked from Gogs to allow it to take a different direction, with a larger group of maintainers and more input from the user community. There were two major attempts to have hosted Gitea. The first was Codeberg, a nonprofit based in the EU. The second is a business that took the name Gitea, is based in the US, and changed Gitea (the software) to the \"open core, closed premium\" model. This change led to the creation of the Forgejo fork, which Codeberg adopted. reply",

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I asked myself why all the talk goes into augmenting or replacing engineers instead of the bosses and let ChatGPT formulate my thoughts:<p>1. Engineers vs. LLMs: low tolerance for mistakes<p>Engineering reality: If a developer pushes code that’s subtly wrong, you can crash a service, corrupt data, or introduce security flaws.<p>LLMs today: Great at producing plausible-looking code, but still prone to logical gaps or hidden bugs that might not be obvious until production.<p>Result: You’d need heavy human oversight anyway — turning the “replacement” into more of a “babysitting” scenario, which could be more costly than just having good engineers write it themselves.<p>2. CEOs vs. LLMs: higher tolerance for ambiguity<p>CEO reality: Decisions are often based on incomplete data, lots of gut feeling, and persuasive narrative. There’s more wiggle room — a “wrong” call can sometimes be spun as “strategic” or “visionary” until results catch up.<p>LLMs today: Excellent at synthesizing multiple data sources, spotting patterns, and generating strategic options — all without bias toward personal ego or politics (well… except whatever biases the training data has).<p>Result: They could produce coherent, well-justified strategies quickly, and humans could still be the ones to communicate and enact them.<p>3. Why this actually makes sense<p>If you think of error cost:<p>Engineer error = immediate, measurable, costly (bug in production).<p>CEO error = slower to surface, more subjective, sometimes recoverable with spin.<p>If you think of data integration skills:<p>LLMs have superhuman recall and synthesis capabilities.<p>CEOs need exactly that skill for market intelligence, competitor analysis, and high-level decision frameworks.<p>So yes — in this framing, replacing CEO-level strategy generation with an LLM and keeping engineers human might actually be more practical right now.\nHumans would still need to do the “face work” (investor relations, internal morale), but the strategic brain could be an LLM fed with all relevant business data.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Downsizing 100 ICs to 90 is lower risk then it is to scale a team of 1 down to 0 (or even a fractional CEO). If you believe AI predictions to be directionally accurate then we can expect/observe that managers will start gaining more responsibilities/tasks as their efficiency goes up. A place to test this hypothesis would be management consulting companies. If we are seeing the big 3 make layoffs and decreased revenue. I think consulting companies are a valid proxy for this idea because they act as buffer capacity for the work you describe as CEO work. reply",

Political - CEOs have significant purchasing power. \n2. Obfuscation - engineering is (relatively tightly defined) but being a CEO is often more fluid and a lot of the decision making is wrapped in stuff like ‘gut’ instinct. There’s no docs for a CEO. \n3. Cultural - we treat CEO’s like art and idolise their value instead of looking at them like a node, that aggregates organisational data flows. To me a CEO is a little like a model router - but with more politics. I think there’s a huge opportunity to replace CEOs but I think like in engineering that doesn’t happen in one shot - it happens by devolving responsibilities. I personally stepped down from the business stuff running startups and small companies because to me it feels like BS and into engineering so perhaps I’m biased. When I ask my CEO mates they’re obviously dogmatically convinced they are irreplaceable. But I think the devil is in the detail. I’m a relatively junior engineer and was crapping myself about ai taking every entry level job - until you get into it and realise there’s a lot more nuance. At least near term. Same for CEO’s. I’d love a world where we can focus on engineering outcomes, not the political crap that weighs us down. My TLDR is I think the main barrier is political, not pure engineering. But I suppose / hope we can re-engineer the political, with effort. reply",

You'll find great explanations about accelerator architectures and the considerations made to make things fast. https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/ In particular your questions are around inference which is the focus of this chapter https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/inference/ Edit:\nAnother great resource to look at is the unsloth guides.

So unlike training where you need to have memory coherence over something like 100k machines and somehow avoid the certainty of machine failure, you just need to route mostly small amounts of data to a bunch of big machines. I don't know what the specs of their inference machines are, but where I worked the machines research used were all 8gpu monsters. so long as your model fitted in (combined) vram, you could job was a goodun. To scale the secret ingredient was industrial amounts of cash. Sure we had DGXs (fun fact, nvidia sent literal gold plated DGX machines) but they wernt dense, and were very expensive. Most large companies have robust RPC, and orchestration, which means the hard part isn't routing the message, its making the model fit in the boxes you have.

The key advantage of doing batched inference at a huge scale is that once you maximize parallelism and sharding, your model parameters and the memory bandwidth associated with them are essentially free (since at any given moment they're being shared among a huge amount of requests!), you \"only\" pay for the request-specific raw compute and the memory storage+bandwidth for the activations.  And the proprietary models are now huge , highly-quantized extreme-MoE models where the former factor (model size) is huge and the latter (request-specific compute) has been correspondingly minimized - and where it hasn't, you're definitely paying \"pro\" pricing for it.  I think this goes a long way towards explaining how inference at scale can work better than locally. (There are \"tricks\" you could do locally to try and compete with this setup, such as storing model parameters on disk and accessing them via mmap, at least when doing token gen on CPU.  But of course you're paying for that with increased latency, which you may or may not be okay with in that context.) reply",

If the requests were regularly spaced, and they certainly won’t be, but for the sake of argument, then 1 machine could serve 17,000 requests per day, or 120,000 per week. At that rate, you’d need about 5,600 machines to serve 700M requests. That’s a lot to me, but not to someone who owns a data center. Yes, those 700M users will issue more than 1 query per week and they won’t be evenly spaced. However, I’d bet most of those queries will take well under 1 second to answer, and I’d also bet each machine can handle more than one at a time. It’s a large problem, to be sure, but that seems tractable. reply",

There's an argument that if compute was the dominant term that Google would never have been anything but leading by a lot. Personally right now I see one clear leader and one group going 0-99 like a five sigma cosmic ray: Anthropic and the PRC. But this is because I believe/know that all the benchmarks are gamed as hell, its like asking if a movie star had cosmetic surgery. On quality, Opus 4 is 15x the cost and sold out / backordered. Qwen 3 is arguably in next place. In both of those cases, extreme quality expert labeling at scale (assisted by the tool) seems to be the secret sauce. Which is how it would play out if history is any guide: when compute as a scaling lever starts to flatten, you expert label like its 1987 and claim its compute and algorithms until the government wises up and stops treating your success persobally as a national security priority. It's the easiest trillion Xi Xianping ever made: pretending to think LLMs are AGI too, fast following for pennies on the dollar, and propping up a stock market bubble to go with the fentanyl crisis? 9-D chess. It's what I would do about AI if I were China. Time will tell. reply",

A big part is simply a massive number of matrix FMA units to process enormous matrix operations, which comprises the bulk of doing a forward pass through a model. Caching enhancements and massively growing memory was necessary to facilitate transformers, but on the hardware side not a huge amount has changed and the fundamentals from years ago still powers the latest models. The hardware is just getting faster and with more memory and more parallel processing units. And later getting more data types to enable hardware-enabled quantization. So it isn't like Google designed a TPU for a specific model or architecture. They're pretty general purpose in a narrow field (oxymoron, but you get the point). The set of operations Google designed into a TPU is very similar to what nvidia did, and it's about as broadly capable. But Google owns the IP and doesn't pay the premium and gets to design for their own specific needs. reply",

          "text": "I think the problem I see with this type of response is that it doesn't take into context the waste of resources involved.  If the 700M users per week is legitimate then my question to you is: how many of those invocations are worth the cost of resources that are spent, in the name of things that are truly productive? And if AI was truly the holy grail that it's being sold as then there wouldn't be 700M users per week wasting all of these resources as heavily as we are because generative AI would have already solved for something better.  It really does seem like these platforms are, and won't be, anywhere as useful as they're continuously claimed to be. Just like Tesla FSD, we keep hearing about a \"breakaway\" model and the broken record of AGI.  Instead of getting anything exceptionally better we seem to be getting models  tuned for benchmarks and only marginal improvements. I really try to limit what I'm using an LLM for these days.  And not simply because of the resource pigs they are, but because it's also often a time sink.  I spent an hour today testing out GPT-5 and asking it about a specific problem I was solving for using only 2 well documented technologies.  After that hour it had hallucinated about a half dozen assumptions that were completely incorrect. One so obvious that I couldn't understand how it had gotten it so wrong. This particular technology, by default, consumes raw SSE. But GPT-5, even after telling it that it was wrong, continued to give me examples that were in a lot of ways worse and kept resorting to telling me to validate my server responses were JSON formatted in a particularly odd way. Instead of continuing to waste my time correcting the  model I just went back to reading the docs and GitHub issues to figure out the problem I was solving for.  And that led me down a dark chain of thought: so what happens when the \"teaching\" mode rethinks history, or math fundamentals? I'm sure a lot of people think ChatGPT is incredibly useful. And a lot of people are bought into not wanting to miss the boat, especially those who don't have any clue to how it works and what it takes to execute any given prompt.  I actually think LLMs have a trajectory that will be similar to social media.  The curve is different and I, hopefully, don't think we've seen the most useful aspects of it come to fruition as of yet. But I do think that if OpenAI is serving 700M users per week then, once again, we are the product.  Because if AI could actually displace workers en masse today you wouldn't have access to it for $20/month. And they wouldn't offer it to you at 50% off for the next 3 months when you go to hit the cancel button. In fact, if it could do most of the things executives are claiming then you wouldn't have access to it at all. But, again, the users are the product - in very much the same way social media played into. Finally, I'd surmise that of those 700M weekly users less than 10%  of those sessions are being used for anything productive that you've mentioned and I'd place a high wager that the 10% is wildly conservative.  I could be wrong, but again - we'd know about that if it were the actual truth. reply",

We know a few things: LLMs are not efficient, LLMs are consuming more water than traditional compute, we know the providers know but they haven't shared any tangible metrics, and the build process involves, also, an exceptional amount of time, wattage and water.

That's 14 LOC per minute . Compared to industry norms of 50-150 LOC per 8 hour day . Apparently,this \"hot-shot\" is not \"naive\", though, implying that it's most definitely legit.

As a result, I get 30-40% more done, and a bigger proportion of it is higher value work. And, AI sometimes helps me with stuff that I -can't- do, like making a good illustration of something.

          "text": "Reading your two comments in conjunction - I find your take reasonable, so I apologise for jumping the gun and going knee first in my previous comment. It was early where I was, but should be no excuse. I feel like if you're going to go down the route of the energy consumption needed to sustain the entire human organism, you have to do that on the other side as well - as the actual activation cost of human neurons and articulating fingers to operate a keyboard won't be in that range - but you went for the low ball so I'm not going to argue that, as you didn't argue some of the other stuff that sustains humans. But I will argue the wider implication of your comment that a like-for-like comparison is easy - it's not, so leaving it in the neuron activation space energy cost would probably be simpler to calculate, and there you'd arrive at a smaller ChatGPT ratio. More like 10-20, as opposed to 100-200. I will concede to you that economies of scale mean that there's an energy efficiency in sustaining a ChatGPT workforce compared to a human workforce, if we really want to go full dystopian, but that there's also outsized energy inefficiency in needing the industry and using the materials to construct a ChatGPT workforce large enough to sustain the economies of scale, compared to humans which we kind of have and are stuck with. There is a wider point that ChatGPT is less autonomous than an assistant, as no matter the tenure with it, you'll not give it the level of autonomy that a human assistant would have as it would self correct to a level where you'd be comfortable with that. So you need a human at the wheel, which will spend some of that human brain power and finger articulation, so you have to add that to the scale of the ChatGPT workflow energy cost. Having said all that - you make a good point with MoE - but the router activation is inefficient; and the experts are still outsized to the processing required to do the task at hand - but what I argue is that this will get better with further distillation, specialisation and better routing however only for economically viable task pathways. I think we agree on this, reading between the lines. I would argue though (but this is an assumption, I haven't seen data on neuron activation at task level) that for writing a command-line tool, the neurons still have to activate in a sufficiently large manner to parse a natural language input, abstract it and construct formal language output that will pass the parsers. So you would be spending a higher range of energy than for an average Chat GPT task In the end - you seem to agree with me that the current unit economics are unsustainable, and we'll need three processes to make them sustainable - cost going up, efficiency going up and usefulness going up. Unless usefulness goes up radically (which it won't due to scaling limitations of LLM's), full autonomy won't be possible, so the value of the additional labour will need to be very marginal to a human, which - given the scaling laws of GPU's - doesn't seem likely. Meanwhile - we're telling the masses at large to get on with the programme, without considering that maybe for some classes of tasks it just won't be economically viable; which creates lock in and might be difficult disentangle in the future. All because we must maintain the vibes that this technology is more powerful than it actually is. And that frustrates me, because there's plenty pathways where it's obvious it will be viable, and instead of doubling down on those, we insist on generalisability. reply",

IDK.  I didn't give human entry level employees that much autonomy.  ChatGPT runs off and does things for a minute or two consuming thousands and thousands of tokens, which is a lot like letting someone junior spin for several hours. Indeed, the cost is so low -- better to let it \"see its vision through\" than to interrupt it.  A lot of the reason why I'd manage junior employees closely are to A) contain costs, and B) prevent discouragement.  Neither of those apply here. (And, you know -- getting the thing back while I remember exactly what I asked and still have some context to rapidly interpret the result-- this is qualitatively different from getting back work from a junior employee hours later). > that maybe for some classes of tasks it just won't be economically viable; Running an LLM is expensive.  But it's expensive in the sense \"serving a human costs about the same as a long distance phone call in the 90's.\"  And the vast majority of businesses did not worry about what they were expending on long distance too much . And the cost can be expected to decrease, even though the price will go up from \"free.\"  I don't expect it will go up too high; some players will have advantages from scale and special sauce to make things more efficient, but it's looking like the barriers to entry are not that substantial. reply",

The ability to produce enough food for those in need already exists, so that problem is theoretically solved.  Granted, logistics engineering[0] is a real thing and would benefit from \"our best and brightest.\" What is lacking most recently, based on empirical observation, is a commitment to benefiting those in need without expectation of remuneration.

      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I recently came across a comment [0] here that highlighted the challenges of building native desktop apps with LLMs. The commenter pointed out how scarce training resources have become—few blog posts, tutorials, or open-source projects exist compared to web or mobile development. They also noted that while desktop app development was a solid career path in the 90s, it's now seen as a dead end for most, outside of big players like Microsoft or Adobe.<p>This got me thinking: My own experience with desktop development dates back to the late 90s using Turbo Pascal 6 in Delphi, and I'm out of the loop on modern practices. With the evolving landscape, I'm curious about what tools and workflows developers are actually using today.<p>Some questions to spark discussion:<p>- What programming languages and frameworks are popular for desktop apps?\n- Are there any go-to IDEs, build tools, or libraries that make development easier?\n- Do the above answers change if you care about code performance or efficiency (whatever that means to you)?\n- Is native desktop app development still viable as a career, or are most greenfield projects shifting to web-based alternatives?<p>I'd love to hear from folks with recent experience—success stories, pitfalls, and recommendations would be great. Thanks in advance for sharing!<p>[0] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44841291\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44841291</a></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "I have been evaluating and testing the Filesystem API for a local first web based CAD editor and having direct r/w access to the filesystem is a great way to make such a thing, couple with the FilesystemObserver[1] API this makes building proper editors on the web a breeze. In place of this, Firefox recommends using the origin private file system (OPFS)[2] which is basically a sandboxed filesystem that the users cannot access. Though I agree from a security perspective it kind of makes sense (not particularly for my usecase), but it removes the ability for the user to have realtime changes on local files. An example of this is using the web based tool as an intermediary step or a processing step in a bigger pipeline; I save it using my web tool and then native applications automatically handle file updates.\nThis just creates an extra step for Firefox/Safari to replicate changes locally by having to manually update local files. Also neither Firefox nor Safari support showDirectoryPicker() which also creates blocks for building a web based editor. I love Firefox and I hope they can add support for this. I have stopped caring about Safari/Webkit completely because it's hellish to try and maintain feature parity while NOT sacrificing innovation and ease of use.

          "text": "At work we use C#, .Net, and WPF.  I've only used it at this company, and I can't say for sure if my dislikes are with WPF, or how our codebase is using it.  Overall it's not terrible, except for being proprietary and Windows only. Outside of work, I'm out in left field using Common Lisp for most of my projects, so I'm not sure how helfpul this is, but... In the past, I used Qt4 because there was an amazing Common Lisp binding and it worked well on Linux, FreeBSD and OSX.  It's increasingly hard to use Qt4 any more, though, and changes in the Qt project made the technique used by the Qt4 bindings impractical for Qt5 or Qt6 - at least that was my understanding when I looked into it. For newer things I've tried LTK but don't really like the looks of it and I wouldn't say it's \"modern\".  It seems to work across platform well enough, though, and for simple stuff it's okay. More often than not I'm using a combination of the Slime tools in Emacs in combination with an GLFW/OpenGL window.  Often I'll use the inspector to display data and make changes that show up in an OpenGL window, or run some commands in the REPL and pop up an image in an external viewer or load something in a browser.  It only works for certain types of applications, and I won't even pretend it's practical for end users, but it works pretty well, and it's flexible as a developer. I'm curious to see what other people say.  It's been a while since I madea full blown GUI application. reply",

          "text": "Topping my list of GUI toolkit requirements are cross-platform and native look & feel. As far as I know, Qt still beats everything else in these areas on the desktop. It's mostly excellent. However, I find The Qt Group's commercial licensing (and their tactics as reported by various people on HN) a little scary. If I were to go commercial, I think I would stick with LGPL Qt and link dynamically or give customers my object files for re-linking, because I get the impression that accepting a commercial Qt license could restrict my ability to use open-source Qt elsewhere. I suppose there might be some other way to safely navigate those waters, but from what I've read, The Qt Group has a reputation for making this far from hassle-free. It's not an immediate problem because I currently use Qt only for open-source and personal tools. I have grown tired of C++, so I've been using Python to drive Qt. The bindings are very good, mirroring the C++ API so closely that I just use the C++ docs when I need to look something up. I've also been watching for Qt bindings to other compiled languages, mainly for distributing non-Linux GUI apps more simply than Python allows. Such bindings often turn out to expose only Qt Quick, which lacks functionality that I sometimes need, but there are a few that expose Qt Widgets. For example, these Go bindings: https://github.com/mappu/miqt I hope we'll eventually see a cross-platform GUI toolkit rivaling Qt in a language more pleasant than C++ (and ideally easier to bind to other languages). The one being developed for internal use by the Zed editor has some promising ideas about how to render native-looking text, which I think is a good start: https://zed.dev/blog/videogame https://www.gpui.rs/ reply",

          "text": "There's a GUI library: https://github.com/flamendless/Slab In general, if you use a minority platform you have to assume it has a tiny minority testing it and so budget for there to be more bugs and so on. LÖVE itself is rock solid, but programs built on it may not be. So I try to minimize the number of layers of libraries I add atop it. So far that has meant I found it easier to just draw my own UI in all my programs.[1] I've only played with Slab a little bit myself. If you use Slab, please do report bugs. I've done that in the past when I've used it. That's what it takes to make a minority platform more stable. [1] Drawing all my own UI also keeps my download sizes small. For example, https://akkartik.itch.io/carousel is 400KB. If you take out 4 fonts and the extensive online help, the code itself is only 100KB. By comparison, Slab seems to be almost 1MB of code. But that's just me. I care a lot about being easy to download on slow internet connections, and less code seems more hackable. But I give up some creature comforts, and reasonable people will disagree with me about the value of a UI library. reply",

Forcing people to take 2 steps hopefully has 2 benefits: 1. You start from day 1 to take baby steps in being mindful of how software is put together for you to use. It's not just a single hermetically sealed box. This part comes from one supplier, this part from another. Both can be modified, and require different skills to modify. 2. You start from day 1 to take baby steps in thinking about whom to trust. Here there are 2 separate projects that would be very hard to collude together. That limits at least the level of malicious stuff I can do. Summary: I don't want a bunch of people blindly trusting me. I want a few people choosing mindfully to trust me. reply",

          "text": "Delphi was so ahead of its time (a mandatory remark)... I've used Delphi 1 to 4  then moved on to other things. Using .NET since 1.0 beta, and it still remains my favorite stack. The project I am currently building is a software infra for building E2EE applications, and it requires a little bit of everything - mobile apps for key management, desktop/cli apps/client libraries for actually encrypting data, sometimes a web based app, and a zero trust backend. Using Xamarin/MAUI for mobile apps, Blazor WASM for Web, Blazor Hybrid / MAUI / Avalonia UI for Desktop. All of the frameworks have their quirks, so it may take a bit of time to learn your patterns, build your base classes, but after that you pretty much enjoy the productivity of a modern high level language. - What programming languages and frameworks are popular for desktop apps?\n- for me - Blazor Hybrid / MAUI / Avalonia UI / WinForms - Are there any go-to IDEs, build tools, or libraries that make development easier?\n- I use MSVS 2022, VSCode for .NET, IntelliJ for $$$ at work. There are of course UI control libraries, I am using MudBlazor for Blazor WASM / Hybrid, other than that I use built-in controls that come with each framework. I try to use as little as possible of 3rd party libraries b/c my apps are security-sensitive. - Do the above answers change if you care about code performance or efficiency (whatever that means to you)? \n- in my case no, I am able to find what I need in .NET ecosystem. Modern .NET supports ahead-of-time compilation compiling to native code, and that helps to reduce start-up time which is important for Desktop / CLI. Ironically, for a long running processes, like a web service, the just-in-time compilation sometimes produces code running faster than ahead-of-time compilation, b/c it learns most common execution paths at runtime, and is able to recompile on the fly, optimizing for most frequent execution paths, giving a non-trivial performance boost in some cases - Is native desktop app development still viable as a career, or are most greenfield projects shifting to web-based alternatives\n- depends on the app/use case. For my project, desktop is the first class citizen, but I am building E2EE apps, i.e. end-to-end-encryption apps, aka client-side encryption, and native / Desktop / CLI is a better fit for E2EE in most of the cases compared to web apps. For those Web apps that I have it is still E2EE but in the browser (still client side encryption) reply",

Rising UI libraries are Tauri, Slint and Iced. There are other alternatives like cross-platform .Net, Java or Flutter. But they don't look very solid and widely adopted. Then there are other UI frameworks for some specific use cases (games, scientific applications, etc). reply",

But it took too long to learn that that should be my approach.

This provides the next person an understanding of why the code looks as it does, and if it should be changed at this new moment in time, when perhaps new hardware is available.

It’s a diversified bet across many aspects of life and many projects (akin to how an index fund is a diversified bet across companies, sectors, geographies). Many of the bets will fail (much like many companies in the market will crash or delist), but some will deliver so much return they carry the rest, but you don’t know which ones and when ahead of time. It will be volatile, but if you persist and survive in the long run the expected outcome tends upwards. reply",

It can bring experiences with family members and friends. Having $1 million in the bank in 40 years will never buy back time you may have wasted working to save that money. I'm not saying that people shouldn't save or invest money for the long term, but I do think more people should take into account what they lose today by only focusing on the long term...

You can just try out new things temporarily.  Take your sofa example.  If you choose to just try a different arrangement of furniture for a short time, that gives you can opportunity to remember to replace the sofa.  The hard part is being willing to experiment with changes, but I find that it reframes things from fixing an old problem to trying something new, which can be more exciting and motivate additional improvements. reply",

If I buy a good quality pair of jeans and I wear them 200 days every year for multiple years, its cost per wear is negligible even if I pay 100-200€ for them. On the other hand a pair of fancy suit pants I wear for that one wedding and maybe Grandma's birthday is going to have a massive cost per wear -> no need to get the top shelf stuff, maybe just rent? Grandma is fine with business casual so I can go in with a jeans and blazer =) The same works with subscriptions. Youtube Family isn't cheap - but we watch so much Youtube content that just the ability to skip all ads on every platform without addons or special clients is easily worth the time saved.

What's the risk that it will actually cost more, considering various ranges of potential numbers (and distributions)?

A detector consisting of a right cylinder at arbitrary distance and orientation is nearby. What is the solid angle? There may exist an analytical solution for this, but I wouldn't trust myself to derive it correctly. It would certainly be a huge mess. If we add that the source is also a right cylinder instead of point source, and we want to add first order attenuation of emitted gammas by the source itself, the spreadsheet becomes only a bit more complex, but there will not be a pen and paper equation solution. In this example every row of the spreadsheet would represent a hypothetical ray. One could randomly choose a location in the source, a random trajectory, and check if the photon intersects the detector. An alternative approach would be randomly choosing points in both target and detector, then doing additional math. The results are recovered by making histograms and computing stats on the outputs of all the rows. You probably need a few thousand for most things at least. Remember roughly speaking 10k hits gets you ~1% statistics. reply",

My understanding is that these sorts of questions come up in ML, and there are ways of dealing with it, but they can't converge nearly as fast as simple iterations like Newton's method.

          "text": "I've used various commercial databases over the years. Some popular commercial databases relevant to HN readers include Web of Science, Scopus, and Engineering Village. When I worked at the USPTO, I used the less popular database Dialog, which I preferred. To my knowledge, none of these are available direct to consumers. I've only been able to get access from places with subscriptions. Some university libraries allow visitors where you can use these databases for free on-site. I would call these databases complementary, not \"entirely superior\". There are two main advantages. One is that these databases will contain many things that you can't find on Google. The second advantage of these databases is that they are designed for advanced searchers and have more powerful query languages. Google on the other hand is dumbed down and will try to guess what you want, often doing a poor job. You can get very specific on these databases in ways that you can't with Google. Related: I'm somewhat fascinated by more specialized bibliographic databases because they often contain things that can't be found on Google or the major commercial databases I listed above. I started keeping a list of them. https://github.com/btrettel/specialized-bibs reply",

All of these are useful only as long as they help you deliver solutions to customers faster. Any effort more is better spent on actually building solutions for customers. Maintainability is nearly top priority; real top priority is to have something to maintain in the first place. Corollary: quick-and-dirty exist for a reason. It's easy to say that quick-and-dirty is just dirty, and it's true: in the long run, quick-and-dirty takes longer than the-right-thing. But, there is a but: time doesn't always have the same value! Time just before a deadline is much more precious than the time after the deadline, when you can relax a bit and fix things before the next stress wave.

Also when building a quick-and-dirty solution, make it LOOK dirty. A fancy UI with a janky back-end will look like polished software to the customer, keep the user experience in sync with the code progress.

As someone mentioned on another AI thread, if AI is so good why aren't people just doing 15 PRs a day on open source projects like Node.js, React, Kubernetes, Linux, Ansible, etc? AI is sometimes a productivity booster for a dev, sometimes not. And it's unpredictable when it will and won't be. It's not great at giving you confidence signals when you should be skeptical of its output. In any sufficiently complex software project, as much of the development is about domain knowledge, asking the right questions, balancing resources, guarding against risks, interfacing with a team to scope and vet and iterate on a feature, managing resources, analyzing customer feedback, thinking of new features, improving existing features, etc. When AI is a productivity booster, it's great, but modern software is an evolving, organic product, that requires a team to maintain, expand, improve, etc. As of yet, no AI can take the place of that. reply",

          "text": "I think you are making a couple of very good points getting bogged down in the wrong framework of discussion. Let me rephrase what I think you are saying: Once you are very comfortable in a domain, it is detrimental to have to wrangle a junior dev with low IQ, way too much confidence but encyclopediac knowledge of everything instead of just doing it yourself. The dichotomy of Junior vs. Senior is a bit misleading here, every junior is uncomfortable in the domain they are working in, but a Senior probably isn't comfortable in all domains. For example, many people with 10+ SE experience I know aren't very good with databases and data engineering, which is becoming an increasingly large part of the job. For someone who has worked 10+ years on Java Backends, now attempting to write Pythin data pipelines, Coding Agents might be a useful tool to gap that bridge. The other thing is creation vs. critique. I often let my code, writing and planning be rewiewed by Claude or Gemini, because once I have created something, I know it very well, and I can very quickly go through 20 points of criticism/recommendations/tips and pick out the relevant ones. - And honestly, that has been super helpful. Using it that way around, Claude has caught a number of bugs, taught me some new tricks and made me aware of some interesting tech. reply",

There is no reason to disparage the senior devs that participated in the study just because you don't like the results of the study. But the study happened, and it is clear: experienced developers are the ones that suffered from using LLMs. > but it's just illogical for a junior to get benefits and the seniors don't Experienced car drivers won't benefit from a youtube tutorial how to drive, junior car drivers might. That's similar to\njunior developers being potentially the ones who can benefit from the basic things that an LLM can help you with, e.g helping you with syntax and structure your thoughts and write a scaffold to get you started. Those are concerns that experienced developers don't need help with, similarly how experienced drivers don't need youtube tutorials how to shift a gear. There is nothing illogical in that premise. Do you agree? > i don't think i can do better than the LLM I most certainly can tell you that there are 1000s of developers that can do infinitely better than any of the current LLMs, and those developers are fairly often senior. It seems like a skill issue you mentioned in the beginning of your post might actually be on your side. reply",

Additionally, the only study to date currently measuring the impact on LLMs on experienced developers found a modest 19% decline in productivity when using an LLM for their daily work. https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-o... Now we can ponder behind the reasons that the study showed experienced developers get a decrease of productivity, and you anecdotally experience a boost of \"productivity\", but why think about things when we can ask an LLM? - experienced developers -> measured decrease of productivity - you -> perceived increase of productivity Here is what ChatGPT-5 thinks about the potential reason (AI slop below): \"Why You Might Feel More Productive If senior developers are seeing a decline in productivity, but you are experiencing the opposite, it stands to reason that you are more junior. Here are some reasons why LLMs might help junior developers like you to feel more productive: Lower Barrier to Entry - LLMs help fill in gaps in knowledge—syntax, APIs, patterns—so you can move faster without constantly Googling or reading docs. - Confidence Boost You get instant feedback, suggestions, and explanations. That can make you feel more capable and reduce hesitation. - Acceleration of Learning You’re not just coding—you’re learning as you go. LLMs act like a tutor, speeding up your understanding of concepts and best practices. - More Output, Less Friction You might be producing more code, solving more problems, and feeling that momentum—especially if you are just starting your coding journey.\" reply",

Now that we can use Copilot, we have a new CIO and I don’t hear about it so much. There is still some AI hype, but it’s more about how it’s being used in our products, rather than how to use it internally to do the work. Apparently sometime in the next year we’re getting a new version of Jira with some AI that can do user stories on its own, but I don’t see that changing much of anything. The bottleneck has rarely been the actual writing of code, it’s been people making decisions and general bureaucracy. AI isn’t solving that. Copilot has also not impressed anyone on my team. As far as the code we work on, it’s pretty bad. There are a few niche things it helps with, mostly writing queries to pull values out of complex json. That saves a little time, but hardly 30-50%. More like 1-2%. Management stopped giving us new people, while pressuring us to do more, for many years now. This was a trend long before AI and I haven’t noticed any major change.

Because the last 2 teams of execs I've worked under both went \"all in\" on AI, asking everyone to use it as much as possible. Both led us down paths that made no sense from a product perspective. Both failed. It is the only time in my career that I've seen an entire exec team get fired all at once, and it happened twice. I know this is one anecdote, and a rare one, but it left me uninspired to just go do it again, not until I find leadership who has a reasonable perspective on AI. To me, that means treating it is just one tool among many, to be used when it is the best tool for a job, and only then. So to answer the original question of how my morale is? It is non-existent. I am quite open to fixing that, but haven't seen much that indicates now is the right time to search for something new. reply",

The \"dream\" of it being able to just take tickets and agentically get a PR up for review is possible for ~5% of tickets. That goes up to ~10% if your organization has no standards at all, including even a self-serving standard like \"at least make sure the repository remains useful to future AI usage\". My organization would still hire as many software engineers as we could afford. - Stack Overflow has to be actually dead at this point. There's no reason to go there, or even Google, anymore. - Using it for exploratory high level research and summarization into unfamiliar repos is pretty nice. - Very rarely does AI write code that I feel would last a year without needing to be rewritten. That makes it good for things like knocking out a quick script or updating a button color. - None of them actually follow instructions e.g. in Cursor rules. Its a serious problem. It doesn't matter how many times or where I tell it \"one component per file, one component per file\", all caps, threaten its children, offer it a cookie, it just does whatever it wants. reply",

It used to be simple to ask questions and get answers, when it grew and the huge influx of questions required moderation it was a nice smooth change but over time the pearl clutching of mods to mark many reasonable questions as irrelevant started to grip the usefulness. I used to answer a lot of the basic questions just to help others as I've felt I had been helped, the moderation shift applying more and more rules started to make me feel unwelcomed to ask questions and even to answer. I do understand why it happened, with the influx of people trying to game the platform to show off in their resumés they were at the \"top\" of whatever buzzword was hot in the industry at the time but it still affected me as a contributing user out of kindness. By 2018 I would not even login to vote or add comments, and I feel it was already going on a slow downhill path, and LLMs will definitely kill it. We will definitely suffer, SO has been an incredible resource to figure out things not covered well in documentation, I remember when proper experts (i.e. maintainers of libraries/frameworks) would jump in to answer about a weird edge case, or clarify the usage of a feature, explain why it was misuse, etc. Right now I don't see anything else that will provide this knowledge to LLMs, in 10-20 years time there will be a lot missing in training datasets, and it will be a slow degradation of knowledge available in the open for us all to learn from. reply",

So if we can get more productivity there's plenty of places to use it. But again, not clear that's actually happening in any major way. I think the jury is still out on this one. Curious what others will say here. My personal opinion is that unless AI gets smart enough to replace more experienced developer completely, and it's far from that, then I'm quite sure there's not going to be less software jobs. If AI gets to a point where it is equal to a good/senior developer we'll have to see. Even then it might be that our jobs will just turn into more managing AI but it's not a zero sum game, we'll do more things. Superintelligence is a different story, i.e. AI that is better than humans in every cognitive aspect. reply",

I'd say, AI writes 95% of my code, and I use it for 75% of the decisions during working on a project. I am under MUCH more pressure to deliver more in shorter periods of time, with just me involved in several layers of decision making, rather than having a whole team. Which may sound scary, but it pays the bills. At one company I contract with, I now have 2 PMs; where I am the only dev on a production app with users, shipping new features every few days (rather than weeks). It feels more like performance art, than it even feels like software development at this point. I am still waiting for some of my features to come crashing prod down in fantastic fashion, being paged at 3am in the morning; debugging for 12 hours straight because AI has built such a gigantic footgun for me.... but it has yet to happen. If anything I am doing less work than before - being paid a little more, and the companies working with me have built a true dependency on my skills to both ship, maintain and implement stuff. reply",

Start building stuff the way you would by yourself, but then start delegating the repetitive tasks to an agent. My best recommendations would be using Cursor in Agent mode, and switching to VScode in Agent mode when your credits with Cursor run out. The reason why I like Cursor more is because of the Checkpoints. And VScode Copilot Agent checkpoints suck; but you can still use git to create your own checkpoints (git add / git stash, etc). I don't even use completions, really just agent mode. I do planning, wireframing, creating specs all with agents. Even small MVPs created in 5 minutes, deployed in 10, during a meeting to just brainstorm. As for the models. Go with Claude 3.5 or 4.0, GPT5. Use sequentialthinking and Taskmaster MCP. I could write a book about it... but the best way to go about it is to dive into, get frustrated, push through and then learn it the hard way.

Sometimes the model just don't work for your workflow. It can become quite delicate. One of the bigger things is when you introduced some bug, start working backwards with the agent, simplifying whatever you build to its bare necessities, and the moment it dissapears, start a new chat, and build it back up to what it was before (in the desired non-bugged state). This often works if you then also switch to a completely different model. reply",

Although the time it saves is not coding time, but googling/boilerplating time.

          "text": "AI has drastically changed how I make decisions about code and how I code in general. I get less bogged down with boilerplate code and issues, which makes me more efficient and allows me to enjoy architecting more. Additionally, I have found it extremely helpful in writing lower-level code from scratch rather than relying on plug-and-play libraries with questionable support. For example, why use a SQLite abstraction library when I can use LLMs to interact directly with the C source code? Sure it’s more lines of code, but I control everything. I wouldn’t have had the time before. This has also been extremely helpful in embedded systems and low-level Bluetooth. In terms of hiring- I co-own a small consultancy. I just hired a sub to help me while on parental leave with some UI work. AI isn’t going to help my team integrate, deploy, or make informed decision while I’m out. Side note, with a newborn (sleeping on me at this moment), I can make real meaningful edits to my codebase pretty much on my phone. Then review, test, integrate when I have the time. It’s amazing, but I still feel you have to know what you are doing, and I am selective on what tasks, and how to split them up. I also throw away a lot of generated code, same as I throw away a lot of my first iterations, it’s all part of the process. I think saying “AI is going X% of my work” is the wrong attitude. I’m still doing work when I use AI, it’s just different. That statement kind of assumes you are blindly shipping robot code, which sounds horrible and zero fun. reply",

If your job is all you have in your life, a lack of purpose in it hits hard. If you have a family, friends, and hobbies, in addition to the job, there is more balance. A lack of purpose in one area doesn’t lead to an overall feeling of unhappiness, because there are other areas where you can draw purpose to prop yourself up with. I say this mostly academically, as I have had almost singular focus on my career, which has had its ups and downs (it’s still be stable and I make money, but I don’t know what it’s all for… I lack purpose). I know rounding out my life would help this, but dealing with my career is easier than facing those other parts of life I’m less adept at navigating. I’ve had nearly 20 years at the same company. I’m really not sure what would happen if that went away tomorrow, when I don’t have another stable area of my life to lean on. reply",

I've brought this up to family and friends but they don't really understand. I tell them that I feel empty because I don't feel like I have a purpose. I don't feel like I'm doing anything meaningful. If my work ended tomorrow, people would quickly find another solution or probably just not need another solution. My friends have moved at a different pace than me. They're married and having kids soon so I expected to see them less. I think sometimes I purposefully distance myself because of this fact.

It feels easy to just dive into work and avoid everything else. Even the last part. Thinking about what I would do if I didn't have my job as a constant. I'm sorry to hear about your feelings of lack of purpose. I read a quote that I don't really remember fully but it was something along the lines of you don't know the answer because it's not the right time.

Use AI to handle the blank page problem (you can reject everything it says afterwards). The trick with side projects is to complete and ship them. The first side project should be limited to 10 hours max. Sometimes shipping is the hard part. Once you can do this, add more time. Do 20 hours, 40 hours, 100 hours, and so on. But progressively.

          "text": "Because in our modern world, productivity is virtue. And if you want to live a virtuous life(= better self image, self actualization), you need to live a productive life. That's what the modern culture have told you. It wasn't always this way, but at some point, increase in productivity stopped being the burden of the system and shifted to burden of the individual. Henry Ford or early factories didn't tell \"each worker to be more productive\", it looked at how the production system could be made more productive. At some point, this was offloaded to the individual. (it did both in reality) But if you determine your self worth by how much you get done, you will forever feel worthless. Maybe this can make you think it from another angle: Productivity rips you apart https://youtu.be/VQK64SrYkzs?feature=shared For me it helped when I consciously trained to shift my attention from \"how much I've done = how much left I need to do and/or compared to others\" to \"how much I've done = how much I've done compared to previous me (checkpoint towards the past) and if the trendline is upward OR I'm actually enjoying the process\". In practice this meant that every time anxiety creeps in, at the spot (this is important), I \"pause\", and try to consciously steer my anxious thought patterns to one that evaluate my done/productivity the other way. reply",

          "text": "I have been lurking on Hacker News for a little under eleven years now and have just now created an account, for whatever this is worth. Within my own life, I've noticed a similar pattern to the one you've described: when I have felt low, such feelings have often coincided with me not feeling that productive at work. Perhaps I'm working on working on a project that isn't particularly motivating. Perhaps I've hit some technical snag that requires me to reconsider my approach and/or implement some inelegant solution that triggers my perfectionistic tendencies. I'll now project some of my own thoughts / feelings about this stuff that may or may not resonate with you (perhaps they'll resonate with some other reader, though). As another commenter has already pointed out, I think a lot of this causal link between happiness and productivity (I think the causality is bidirectional, too), is conditioned in some way. Specifically, I think this sort of depression arises when we fail to live up to some internally-held, idealized image of ourselves. Having some standards to live up to is probably healthy, although, if the standards are too high or unrealistic, then neuroses will follow. For context, I'm drawing a lot on Karen Horney's ideas in _Neurosis and Human Growth_. If this diagnosis makes resonates, then the solution is to diminish the role one's idealized self plays in one's thoughts and actions, which diminishment probably involves a lot of mindfulness and also some sifting through of one's \"shoulds\". What are the top ten things that you're thinking of doing? For each of those things, consider: is this something that you think you should do, or it something you actually want to do? If the former, continue to introspect: why do you feel like you should be doing something you don't want to do. Obviously, there's some things we all must do that we probably don't want to do. I think with work, though, it's very easy to become disconnected from what you actually want. If you don't like what you do on some fundamental level, or something feels off inherently (even if this feeling is unconscious), you'll probably begin to dissociate / compartmentalize in some way which might contribute to your underlying feelings of depression. Again, I'm assuming a lot, here - maybe this applies, maybe this doesn't. Whatever the cause, I wish you the best in dealing with it. Life's too short to take too seriously :). reply",

          "text": "I don't know you personally and can't offer individual advice, but there are some general things about our culture and general psychology that might be helpful to people like you dealing with those sorts of feelings (and yes I have been/am one of them): 1. A lot of social status is attached to productivity. This makes it really easy to feel like you \"should\" be doing things that you don't actually care about because society convinces you that you should. If your self-worth or self-image gets wrapped up in these things (and that's very easy to happen to any of us as social creatures), it's can be an easy recipe for unhappiness and feeling like you're not driving your own life. 2. Doing complex projects is challenging, and it's easy to lose motivation quickly when your initial enthusiasm wears off and the slog kicks in. You may have high aspirations and not be comfortable / willing to pay the cost they actually require. I highly recommend Dr. K's (Healthy Gamer) videos about motivation, especially internal vs. external motivation. Not a panacea or anything but I think they give you a good foundation to work through those feelings. Obviously you may also want to consider professional help if you suffer these sorts of feelings extremely or persistently. reply",

          "text": "Just begin telling yourself you should have never had to earn your parents love with external outcomes. The love should have been free (this realization can make you break down and cry and it’ll be a really good cry, trust me). Really internalize that. Don’t be pissed about it, but always remember that daily. Some small therapy (a few sessions) can help to articulate it and get it out. Should be okay. Basically you have to realize you have a dysfunctional version of self love from all of it. You wouldn’t treat your own kid like that so that’s all you need to know. I was just reading a /r/ptsd (which is something you might have) about a girl who was single in her 30s and feels like a failure to her parents for not being married and having kids. It’s utterly fucked parenting, I hear about it all the time. Also, your parents invalidating this is a form of gas-lighting. You’re gonna have to love the fuck out of yourself somehow, every last bit of you. Every little hobby, every little post, every little attire, every little imperfection, every little achievement. Your family didn’t know how to love properly and now you don’t. As you start this process, you will feel shame . It’s part of the process. What kind of adult judges their parents like this? A fucked up one (seriously). Not fucked up as in “bad”, fucked up as in the conveyor built in the factory dropped you and you are fucked up. That’s okay, and your ass is going to have to deal with it (the most adult thing you’ll ever do, and it’ll take awhile). PTSD is real. ——- Lastly, people in life are not stupid. Everyone may not know everything, but just about everyone’s subconscious knows the truth. You can prove it to yourself by simply observing your emotions, they didn’t come out of thin air. You didn’t just hang out in a vacuum in space and return to Earth feeling this way and that way about things. Shit happened, you and the universe know it. Your soul will not let you rest until you heal it. Best of luck! reply",

I just retested all of them and it really seems none are fully usable. I also see few improvements since April, it seems many of the teams either burned out trying to finish in time, were overwhelmed seeing what it really takes to make the details work after the fun parts are over or were disappointed seeing how low user numbers are from direct switchers. I disagree with your 2010 theory, back then it would have been even less fruitful to make a viable alternative with the limited time and resources available. Especially as things like the UI state handling and some of the architecture was unheard of back then, years ahead of its time and even linear now does not fully match many aspects. Similarly \"Any half-skilled indie dev could have made a killing on making a good replacement\" is just wrong, \na) you need to be a really great developer to make something that even nearly matches PT, there is more than is obvious to someone not deeply familiar with the internals of the product and 15 year of refinements that went into it. A few of the cloning teams were some of these indie developers who thought it would be fun and easy which was obviously very naive. b) \"Make a killing\" is equally misleading. I would be surprised if its possible at all to break even on something like a pure PT clone. There are maybe 200 original users who are super loud and \"in love\" but this can easily mislead to thinking there are millions of users that would be immediately jump on and start paying. It takes probably 2 orders of magnitude more addressable market to make the financials work just by providing a PT clone (Which is why lanes.pm is focusing on making what tracker would need to be today not just catching up on what it was.) Just give it a bit more time, there are at least 2 teams including lanes working on this and we all decided not to launch something half baked and buggy that loses your data. reply",

          "text": "My biggest issue with Linear is that it doesn't think about cycles the way Pivotal did sprints.  Or more accurately, it's in what PT called \"commit mode\" all the time. If your cycle ends with a bunch of work undone, it rolls into the next cycle.  If that cycle already a full capacity of work planned, well, now your cycle is at 150% or whatever.  Repeat.  The solution, presumably, is to stop creating new cycles. But what PT would do, and seamlessly at that, is rebalance the sprints.  Your project manager wants to move a number of stories to the top of the backlog?  Great, but now that item projected for three sprints out is now four sprints out.  The velocity and the projections were extracted from reality, not mandated from on high. I asked Linear if they could add this -- a cycle rebalance.  I was told, no, this simply isn't something they want to do, but maybe I could do it with zapier.  Trying to get them to understand why I wanted this was like trying to explain air to a fish.  It simply did not compute. reply",

This isn't 100% reliable but is useful as a first pass (where a human can investigate further) or a backstop (against a human missing something important and obvious but buried in a long file or huge volume of files). I also put together a half-baked web extension to try to steer the Youtube algorithm. It basically scrolls through shorts and tries to watch+like high quality content and skip+dislike junk (and worse) to scrub it out of the feed as much as possible. It's only looking at the transcript and a couple of thumbnails, so it's not super accurate, but in the short term it's been working pretty well. I figure that Google can probably tell that it's not a human though, and might disregard its inputs (or ban me) in the long term.  Time will tell. reply",

It depends on your financial/legal situation, those of your co-founders(if any), and what types of \"returns\" you are referring to by ROI. 1) The obvious benefit is to get plugged into the network there. You don't need to be there all the time to accomplish this. Waterloo, and Canada in general, is still cheaper COL wise compared to Bay area/NYC etc, so it'll help with your burn rate to build in Waterloo. Most people's burn rate at least doubled when they move themselves or their team. Flying in every few months could be enough. 2) If you're convinced you need to move to the Bay area, it might be useful to incorporate your business in the US and look at your visa options. I think there's a regular Ask HN about immigration issues. You likely need to do this anyways if you're fundraising in the US. The typical setup is some sort of Delaware corp with a Canadian subsidiary, if needed. IANAL and you should get professional advice here. 3) Get married to a US citizen and your personal visa issues will be solved lol. reply",

It will be a Python project that will access Microsoft cloud using the Graph 1.0 API.<p>One advantage of the situation is that this project is a bit standalone and I don't have to feed it 2000 already existing classes from an existing legacy codebase to give it a context to work with.<p>What would you recommend me?<p>Are there any dark patterns involved, e.g. de-facto un-cancellable subscriptions that will make me cancel my card instead?<p>I would be happy hearing your experience and tales from the battlefield.</p></p></p></p></p></div>",

Take time planning, always have it reference your CLAUDE.md and existing code patterns. At the end of each step, I have CC determine whether or not to update the CLAUDE.md if there's any foundational updates. The trick is to have a idea of what you're expecting out of these tools. If you can use the tool to break down the work into individual pieces you will find it is really fun and productive way to build software. You still have to think, but you are able to cover a lot more ground faster. I can't type out 4 files that are in my brain in 10 seconds. reply",

I in fact want the exact opposite sort of interaction, where they push back against my ideas and actively try to correct and improve my thinking.

I feel like when I modify the default response style, I'm probably losing something, considering that the defaults are what go through extensive testing. reply",

With an LLM it's too easy to get drawn deep into the weeds. For example, I may propose that I use a generalized framework to approach a certain problem. In a real conversation, this may just be part of the creative process, and with time the thoughts may shift back to the actual hard data (and perhaps iterate on the framework), but with an LLM, too often it will blindly build onto the framework without ever questioning it. Of course it's possible to spur this action by prompting it, but the natural progression of ideas can be lost in these conversations, and sometimes I come out 15 minutes later feeling like maybe I just took half a step backwards despite talking about what seemed at the time like great ideas. reply",

It's like the mathematical version of a hallucination. There is no real reason it should do this for grad level topics - they just haven't trained it enough. It has a survey level knowledge of a TON of ideas, which can be great if you are looking for topics related to something, but as far as the details of exactly how things are related, what subtleties and caveats there are and so on, it will just hallucinate its first guess and get stuck there for the rest of the conversation. o3-pro is maybe marginally better, but it takes a very long time to respond and so I rarely use it. 4o is much worse and so I usually use o3. Gemini 2.5 Pro is much better - and free. Grok 4 is also probably up there with Gemini 2.5. They just have less tendency to hallucinate in this way in general: they will spend more time reasoning, checking claims, searching for prior literature, etc. They still mess up, but not quite as much as o3. I don't use Sonnet or Opus for math all that much - my impression was that o3 was better than Sonnet 3.7 but not sure about 4. reply",

Also got S-notation of operators in correct nested order as well. AND got Bison”s semantic action (state transition), lexical token …. Cna make EBNF from Bison (although Bison does it better). But it fails often in form of brevity of which an expert (like me) would prod ChatGPT occasionally of omissions. Makes assumptions of some keywords having invalid value ranges, invalid syntax arrangement, and provides incorrect terminators. So, I considered ChatGPT to be more of a intermediate editor’s README that requires occassional consult with EBNF notations and Vimscript man page, and more often Bison’s parser source (parser_bison.y) file to be final arbitrator. Does it learn?  Constant ‘nft’ command outputs set ChatGPT straight.  But there are slippage when starting a new ChatGPT session which leads me to believe that it won’t learn for others (as well as me). EDIT: say “no glazing” cuts down on filler words, nicely. reply",

          "text": "I disagree. I spent about 2 years in Romania without healthcare of any kind. I was on a career break/sabbatical. And in the 4 years I've spent in the Netherlands, I've only went to a doctor's office once, for some abdominal pain. I was sent home by a receptionist, telling me to return the next day if it doesn't get better. And I think that's my only interaction with the medical establishment for the last 6-7 years. The one before that was for some document I needed for my driver's license. Of course, here in the Netherlands you can't avoid having health insurance, but it's technically free for low income people and not that expensive otherwise. In Romania, and I presume that a lot of other places, you can. So is it that hard to stay uninsured? I do have some gripes to pick with the medical system, but yeah, I do think taking health into your own hands is a better choice (and a lot more is psychological in nature than the medical system would suggest, which is focused on symptoms and not causes). I remember in my younger years, I would get a cold probably twice a year on average, and I would always get prescribed antibiotics by an overzealous GP. All of that stopped all of a sudden, and I haven't taken antibiotics in about a decade. I've caught a cold, maybe once every two years, but much lighter and goes away by itself in 2-3 days at most. reply",
