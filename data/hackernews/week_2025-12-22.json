      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I was listening to an old postcast from 2021 which discusses the inexplicable rise of Python.<p>I remember much of the positive sentiment around Python in the early days being less about Python and more about how powerful Perl is but Perl is Perl. Python being the nice and clean version of Perl meant it got all all the praise of Perl while enjoying the reputation of having none of the failings of Perl. In hindsight I think Python needed to stand on its own right, not just as a better Perl, but yet here we are. I think hindsight will show we should have considered the defects of Python more deeply. I know the lispers saw them but no one listens to them. Today Python is most dominant language on the planet and Perl is all but forgotten.<p>If you survey the language landscape now, a language can be much better than Python but never get the chance Python did just because it happened to look a bit better than Perl. Which is absurd to me.</p></p></div>",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Today is the worst day of my life. We live in a country near Cambodia, and as you know, it is kind of a dream land for scammers. Today, it happened to my family.<p>My mother received a call from a scammer. They told her she needed to process some tax issue and prove that her bank account had enough money. In just a few minutes, they tricked her and manipulated her into entering banking OTP codes. All of her savings are now gone.<p>What makes this more dramatic is that last year I architected and helped a government department in my country build a big system. This system can track money flows across the whole country, to know where money comes from. I was very proud of this. It is the biggest achievement of my life. Even if nobody knows I built it, that was fine.<p>But now I cannot protect my own mother. I cannot protect my family. My system can track the money, but it is almost impossible to get it back.<p>When I went to the police, just in one small area, there were more than 20 cases in a single day. A hardworking student sent all their family's money, thinking it was for university fees or going abroad. An old factory worker lost all her retirement savings. So many people lost everything. That is when I realized that the system I built, the system I was proud of, is not enough.<p>All my own savings are gone too. (My mother was scammed into borrowing a lot of money and sending it to the scammers, and now it is my responsibility.) I had plans for the next few years: to do open source work, to write books about math and programming, to create a dream Go web framework, to give back to the community. Now all of that is gone.<p>But this is not only about me. I can still start over. I am strong enough to rebuild my life. But who will protect people like my mother? Or a poor student? Or a factory worker? Or so many others?<p>I can build systems. I can build distributed systems that scale to a whole country. But for what? What should I do?<p>I have been reading Hacker News for 12 to 13 years, sometimes posting from other accounts. I am writing here now to ask for advice and help from this community.<p>If anyone has experience with similar cases, or ideas on what can realistically be done, or even advice on how to move forward after something like this, I would really appreciate it. I will keep this account semi-private, because with the details above, I think some engineers from my country may recognize me.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

She had to come out of retirement and go back to work because of it. I think crimes like this are among the most evil you can commit to people. I really wish that law enforcement organizations would chase these down and prosecute as aggressively as they would if there had been a murder or something committed. They are fully capable of doing so when it's something that they care enough about, but they just don't seem to care about people like your mother and my friend.

Click on any function call then the callee shows up in a new window with proper highlighting. Click on a struct object it immediately shows the struct def in a panel stick to the bottom of the screen. Essentially, it’s like VSCode Peek definition but with a different visual style, and similar to the same functionality of source insight but free and in Linux. The purpose is to read xv6 source code. I have found some parts of the kernel, e.g. the file system to be convoluted, and I need to follow quite a few jumps to form the system mindset. Having such a small tool is very helpful. Actually it doesn’t look too hard to implement. Maybe I’ll write it myself in QT. reply",

Do you think one of the main factors is meeting new people/the sense of community? Anyway good job! I'm not sure what your margins are but it's probably more than 500/month! Congrats! reply",

I’m just going to bullet some of them out in no particular order: - We do the work to find the restaurant and curate a menu, story, and theme. E.g., we might go to an Indian restaurant and focus the event on only the southern regional dishes. - Many times we have dishes that are off menu specially for our event. - Sense of community. We have quite a few regulars who have gotten to know each other. In 2025, 45 people reached their 20th or 30th event with us. Since we take over the whole restaurant there’s a little more freedom in how the space is used. Lots of new friendships have been forged. - When you go to a restaurant with a friend or small group, you can only order so much. We’ve had events with upwards of 25 different bites. There’s really no better way to sample everything the restaurant has to offer. - There’s a few people who say their partner are picky eaters, so they come to our event each month to have the opportunity to be a bit more adventurous. It’s an incredibly diverse group with a lot of different reasons to attend. reply",

          "text": "My partner and I divide and conquer. He focuses on front of house and I handle the backoffice. The process starts ~3 months before the event. We start by picking a theme or region. Then contact some restaurants that fit the criteria and pitch them the event. That kicks off the back and forth on cost and menu. Around 4 weeks before the event we send a save the date + previous event recap email. We summarize the last event and tease the next event, without giving away the actual resturant or type of food. Over the next week we prep the invite email and payment forms. This requires putting the dishes on our menu template, research and writing about the history of the dishes, the region, and the resturant. Some of this content also goes onto our website. Three weeks out we send the invite, which is a lottery system. Members have 5 days to request a seat and place a credit card hold. 5 days later we run the lottery (I wrote some basic software to randomize assignment, conver the card auth to capture and release any cards that didn't get assigned a ticket). Then we send an email to everyone who got in with which night they recieved and another email to anyone who was waitlisted. Everyone is added to a spreadsheet to track. 1 week before the event we send a reminder email and a last chance to cancel before the ticket is non refundable. At the event we play host and check each guest in and say hi to everyone. Then we give a prepared ~5 min intro about the food, restaurant, celebrate any milestone members, and make any general house keeping accounments. Our 20 club members get a branded apron. At the event we take video and pictures. Over the course of the next 4 weeks we post dish pictures with descriptions and history of the dish on our instagram. We also make a 1-2 min recap video of the event which also goes on our instagram and website. Separate from the actual event related work we have to manage the books, handle members emails, and review membership requests. More recently we started selling shirts, so there's a little work in managing that as well. reply",

We also have an unbelievably respectful and mature community. After over 70 seatings we’ve never had an incident. We also have a code of conduct document we send all new members. Second, we setup an LLC to shield us personally from legal liability. Third, not to say that it shields us, but the restaurants also have insurance and are a better target for a lawsuit.

The compute would differ, but loading speed shouldn't be an issue if you can render the HTML first, and hydrate it after page load. This static HTML would then also serve as fallback when Javascript is disabled. - For a quick demo, I doubt you will lose people by embedding an older version. Serving a version of a few months ago seems like 80% of the work, with 20% of the effort, in terms of deployment. Anyhow, nice to see government funds put to a good cause! reply",

          "text": "There's a really awesome site called Librivox [1], where volunteers narrate books that are in the public domain. Those recordings are also in the public domain as well (this is just part of the Librivox thing). The quality of those recordings (both the narration, and the actual recording quality) varies quite a bit and most of them aren't at a quality I'd expect people to pay for and thus aren't useable for me. I've spent hours and hours sorting through those recordings finding the best ones (from a narration perspective) and then improving the recording/audio quality on them. Those recordings have all mostly been made in the last 20yrs, so they're not old recordings of the books. So, the value I add to the Librivox recordings are: curation/selection, audio enhancement, and a much better delivery mechanism (IMHO). I'm also simultaneously building out our own library of original audio content by working with voice actors to get them recorded and proof read (this is a very expensive and time consuming process, but also very fun). One of the hardest parts is honestly the proofing process. Once I get finished narration files I have to compare them result with the actual script (as there are always mistakes) and request edits. I use whisper.cpp to transcribe them and then git and a few other scripts to compare the transcript with the actual book text. I'll also add that I _do not_ use AI Audio narration because it just doesn't sound good IMHO, and I personally hate listening to it. I regularly run experiments to see what the current state of the tech is and it's still pretty far from where it needs to be IMO. I also don't love the idea of AI swallowing absolutely everything. I appreciate the feedback and compliment! [1] https://librivox.org/ reply",

What it does - Exact duplicate detection using incremental hashing so it doesn’t have to fully load huge files. - Perceptual image matching finds similar images even if they’re resized or lightly edited (not just byte-for-byte duplicates). - Native macOS integration with a Finder right-click scan. Why I built it: My brother kept running out of space because of tons of photos, and every existing tool I tried either missed similar images or was slow and clunky - so I spent a couple of weekends building something that felt fast, accurate, and native. Business side - Free trial (no CC required). - Paid tiers: ~$5.99/yr or ~$16.99 lifetime. Got positive feedback and 100+ paying users shortly after launch. Been growing steadily ever since.

Attention spans will drop even lower, causing severe psychological problems. Think 'Digital Dementia 2.0.' Later, LLMs will be portrayed as something evil, yet everyone will still use them. Parents will use them, while telling their kinds not to do so. Leetcode is already standard for SWE interviews, but other industries will need to adopt similar tests to verify that an applicant's brain is functioning correctly and that they're capable of doing the job. Maybe a formal confirmation from a psychologist specializing in 'fried brains' will be required. reply",

And amongst my peers, especially those without a background in IT, misunderstanding and anthropomorphising has made this even worse. I think for people who already have great skills, AI will probably be helpful, not harmful.

AI just enables you to work on bigger problems because you’re not spending so much time “calculating by hand”.

LLMs start feeling like databases or cloud compute. No SpaceX or OpenAI IPO moment. Capital markets quietly reward the boring winners instead. S&P 500 grinds out another double digit year, mostly because earnings keep up and alternatives still look worse. Tech discourse stays apocalyptic, but balance sheets don't. If you mute politics and social media noise, 2026 probably looks like one of those years that we later remember as \"stable\" in retrospect. Bonus: Bitcoin sees both 50k and 150k. reply",

Elite universities will continue to do well but the value there becomes elitism and social status (this has been apparent for a long while already). Value of experience will grow - compounding this will be less opportunity for junior people to get that experience so they will be increasingly (and rightly) frustrated. The opportunities to have a successful career as a salaried employee decline significantly - people are pushed to start small businesses out of necessity - and this barrier is lower due to AI. A flurry of new dev tooling companies start up re-packaging software development processes and concepts into a more user friendly package that allows software development to go even more mainstream to accommodate this. reply",

I really feel \"web dev\" is going to get highly commoditized by GenAI, by web dev I mean 99% of building CRUD-adjacent apps, we are already seeing it now with tools like Claude Code etc, this pipeline is just going to get more refined, with tigther testing feedback loops, PR-workflows and a CI/CD deployment pipeline which the GenAI will control. This might be amplified by the fact the sheer amount of tested, high quality there is in the JavaScript-ecosystem for the AI to train on and learn from. Software engineering in general will tend more systems and embedded software, fields where GenAI can't perform well or can't be trusted to produce good code (I am thinking writing device drivers, or maintainence of legacy C applications) as well as deep research fields. The average software engineering job might be either that of a \"technical product manager\", or \"researcher\" or \"low-level systems expert\" That's just what I feel. Honestly, I am probably much younger an others on this forum, so I haven't really seen this industry \"evolve\" this is just how it looks to me now. I believe there was a time in the early 2010s where there was a boom of this \"generalist developer\" where if you knew your JavaScript-ecosystem (or App Dev ecosystem for that matter) pretty well, you could land a pretty decent job right out of college, or without a college degree at all. To me, at this stage the world in general needs software engineers who understand the \"world\" if that makes sense (in terms of physics, mathematics), or who have a really good mental model of computation. Better put, software engineering will become a tool in the larger context of research & development of tech that advance humanity. reply",

I have observed many roles like SRE etc, require certain experience which is hard to get by working on your own projects without much traction; similiar case for cybersec but to a lesser extent.

Yes that's true but I would argue this isn't because of AI itself. Sure it might have accelerated it but I have heard that in the 2020's a lot of people got a lot of jobs in the industry and then its that the market did feel saturated and in a sense, a lot of jobs feel this way in the economy where if someone has it, they continue having it but its becoming harder for new people to enter, there are financials reasons for this too mostly if i remember, interests rates are one of the core reasons That being said, Even though I have used LLM's a lot, I do not agree with your opinion and I am even younger than you most likely (17) A lot of people my age/people just going into college would use AI a lot to cheat but I will genuinely try to take it slow to learn things. I will try to use it as a learning tool and not as a crutch. Currently I am still in high school and I get ideas which I wish to implement but dont have the time because of exams so I test them out with LLM's but even I find the whole process frustrating at times and its just, maybe its me but there is a good ceiling that I can process. Some basic crud processes can definitely be in that but if your project is novel, even basic things can be hard I will give you an example, I recently tried creating an api for proton docs which worked by having browser instances. I had two basic scripts that worked on one platform and converted them to puppeteer using LLM and after it worked, I then asked it to simply create a very basic crud api on top of it Nope, I tried it 5-6 times on the best models on the market but they couldn't actively take two files which had read/write and have it work, either there was an issue in read or an issue in write I am fine with the project as it is right now and I am fine with the templates it has given me and I am going to build it now on top of it I had many ideas which could be considered basic crud apps like having a kanban app/github issues like ui on top of bitwarden after I saw a post here by simon saying how he uses github issues and that went semi-viral on hackernews Another issue is that I think just as how sure writers and similar can generate AI generated, I feel like there would be more trust on the non AI generated code. Personally I will try my best to create prototypes with AI and if I like them, I will see what it does and then rewrite them myself as an learning experience and also because people say spec driven development etc. but I just want to code things by hand at this point or convert the LLM generated prototypes of idea to something that I later code and understand by hand tbh (most likely when I get into college) reply",

          "text": "I wrote a lot. Let me add a tldr: any international trades happening in non-US dollar is an \"acceleration\" of dedollarizatiom, given that currently all trade is dollarized. Original: I don't known if I understand the spirit of the question. There are no metrics or tracking of how \"dollarized\" the international economy is because virtually all trade is done in dollars and there has been no risk of this changing for the past ?65? years My original prediction for 2026 ( not 2025, mind you) made in 2024 was based on a few factors, if I recall correctly, 1) the Russia-Ucraine war and related sanctions; 2) the open discussion in BRICS about trade in direct currencies; and 3) the then-promised isolatonist policies of Trump's second mandate. What we've seen in 2025 makes all of those stronger I guess. 1) I don't know the status of the Russia-Ucraine war; all I know is it is a glaring sign of the end of Pax Americana (as is the Israel-Palestine genocide/war, by the way, which the US would -not- have allowed given the strong internal opposition and negative popularity among the American public). So sanctions of Russia notwistanding, that status quo, which strongly related to dollar as reserve currency, is either agonizing or dead. 2) Trump and the US attempted a very strong response to the (first ever?) trades in local currency between Brazil and China, mostly in the form of targeted tariffs (all discourse about Bolsonaro and whatever being the motivation for tariffing Brazilian imports being, in my opinion, political smoke and mirrors). I don't think it worked. I think BRICS might press on this. If the mercosur/EU trade deal goes through it will also be a strong force towards trade in Euros/Reais/Pesos directly I believe. 3) I don't think I need to clarify; tariffs and other issues brought on by the current US government were severely negative to the placement of the US as a preferred trade partner. This is to beyond economic choice; active anti-american sentiment are at all times high in countries like Canada, Denmark, and Mexico, all historically aligned with the US. This may not seem that relevant but come election cycles in those and other countries we might see platforms/candidates that openly propose to \"secede\" from the US hegemony international order. If that happens, removing US military bases is a first go. Alternatives to the US \"petrodollar\" a close second. reply",

The core issue is structural: most cryptocurrencies depend on foundations that fund development, marketing, and operations through large token holdings. When prices fall, these entities eventually become forced sellers. At some point, their “whale power” is not optional but necessary to survive, creating persistent sell pressure and undermining long-term trust. Bitcoin likely has a longer lifespan than most alternatives due to its lack of a foundation, fixed monetary policy, and social inertia. Over time, it may absorb whatever residual trust exists in the broader crypto space. However, that does not imply indefinite relevance: Bitcoin could survive while gradually becoming economically marginal, not dead, but increasingly negligible outside niche use cases. reply",

Or to put it another way, the thing you do is to solve the actual problems other people have. That's what you need to sell. You aren't selling the fact that you know how to use a hammer. You are selling the idea that you can build the right hammer for the job. So sales is not \"out reach.\" It is \"what do you need?\" and you will probably do better by optimizing for getting to that conversation, not through optimizing for low effort on your part. Linked-in is best used for networking not push notification. Networking is about trust. Maybe you can't help with someone's problem but you know someone who can. Finally, you can't sell desperately.

I've made friends here, have been helped by people on projects that I was busy with, did the reverse, found friends and business partners and spend way too much time. HN is a very interesting slice of the online world, a place that is unlike the rest, sometimes a bit dry but always interesting and extremely useful. If you're looking at it to try to understand it then you might as well try to understand a rat or a mouse. You won't understand it because it isn't there to be understood, it just is, like any other organism. The root of HN is a thing called 'startup news', that was changed very quickly and since then HN has been a focal point for techies of all sorts but also lots of other people from all walks of life and from a large variety of countries. It isn't 'one thing' to everybody that participates, just like a hammer is a different thing for a carpenter than it is for a masoner or a farmer. The fact that after being a member for a couple of years you have this question indicates a lack of participation, not a lack of understanding. reply",

          "text": "> Hacker news is there to promote ycombinator companies I should probably clarify this a bit. It's true that HN sponsors Launch HNs (and Show HNs) by YC startups. This is in the FAQ: https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html . However, YC would not be funding HN if that were the only reason for it. It's a secondary factor. Far more important than promoting existing startups is attracting founders who might start new startups. This requires an entirely different strategy than promotion: it requires being interesting enough to attract the right kind of users. That's why the site is organized around curiosity, as I explained elsewhere in the current thread ( https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46309399 ). For more on this, here are past explanations: optimizing for curiosity - https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&sor... relationship between HN and YC's business interests - https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=false&so... reply",

We literally give exactly the same information and help to YC-funded startups as we do to non-YC-funded startups who ask for assistance with their Show HNs. That's because giving “extra help” to YC-funded startups is far less valuable (to everyone including the startup themselves [1]) than just making HN interesting to readers and showcasing cool projects, no matter who has built them. [1] More than almost anything else, what I've learned from moderating HN is that “extra help” to get onto the front page of HN is of barely any help at all. That is, if the post isn't interesting enough to earn significant numbers of upvotes and good comments very quickly, it will disappear off the front page very quickly. Also, any time a story is on the front page that the community doesn’t think belongs there, it feels off and attracts flags and complaints. reply",

I've also seen people associated with YC backed companies here downvoted into the toilet for spouting unpopular opinions. The only thing that possibly could happen (and that would be fairly hard to detect) is brigading on a company level, but I would accuse the likes of Google and Apple of that long before I would do so with the YC mods. Think about the opportunity cost of moderating this site. If you take that into account and then combine what you know of Dan and Tom with them selling out their integrity for a pittance if it would come to light that they did so it would wreck their reputation, which is pretty much the only compensation they really get here.

I've always been a fan of analyzing all of the flags retro-actively to see if they were just or not and to have a per-subject matrix that would weigh flags from particular users.

I’m not the person you asked the question of - but I think the purpose of ycombinator is to give relevant people a place to discuss things aligned with the ecosystem in which ycombinator operates, to help strengthen and champion that ecosystem. Does it have a payoff for ycombinator? Almost certainly. Was it created with that explicit purpose in mind? I doubt it. There are easier ways to make money. reply",

If we take what he wrote at face value, I don’t think the purpose was primarily its promotional value. https://paulgraham.com/hackernews.html _ Hacker News was two years old last week. Initially it was supposed to be a side project—an application to sharpen Arc on, and a place for current and future Y Combinator founders to exchange news._ _ Hacker News is an experiment, and an experiment in a very young field. Sites of this type are only a few years old. Internet conversation generally is only a few decades old. So we've probably only discovered a fraction of what we eventually will._ _ Hacker News is definitely useful. I've learned a lot from things I've read on HN. I've written several essays that began as comments there. So I wouldn't want the site to go away. But I would like to be sure it's not a net drag on productivity. What a disaster that would be, to attract thousands of smart people to a site that caused them to waste lots of time._ reply",

As to how I (or anyone) could show this, here are a few example questions: 1. How many examples of stealthy but otherwise blatant promotion do you see in the comments? Not every astroturfing campaign will be successful or original, so you'd be able to notice some patterns. Plus, HN is already commercially oriented, and there's the \"Show HN\" option, so it reduces the incentives for astroturfing. 2. Alternatively, how much controversy is there around the specific type of forum? For some subreddits, for example, you'd be able to see counter-subreddits popping up when participants feel the mods are abusing their power to promote one type of opinion. 3. Is a certain type of political/brand-related opinion or interpretation always at the top of your comment feed? For example, if upvotes determine the order of the comments, do you consistently see fewer critical comments on things that you'd expect the community to react to in different ways. 4. Do you consistently see some contributors having more power in discussions over others? Other than the mods, obviously. If this is the case, karma (i.e., number of upvotes) often has more value. Still, I could be wrong. reply",

          "text": "(I'm a mod here) It's true that this place can be cryptic, and that has downsides—specifically, it can be confusing to newcomers, even to some newcomers who would make ideal HN users. That sucks. But there's a key that unlocks most of the puzzles. That is to understand that we're optimizing for exactly one thing: curiosity. (Specifically, intellectual curiosity, since there are other kinds of curiosity too.) Here are links to past explanations about that: https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&sor... We try to elevate things that gratify curiosity: creative work, surprising discoveries, deep dives, technical achievements, unusual personal experience, whimsical unpredictability, good conversation, etc. And we try to demote things that run against curiosity, especially repetition, indignation, sensationalism, and promotion. It gets complicated because you'll also see plenty of repetition, indignation, sensationalism, and promotion on HN—alas! This is the internet after all. But the site survives because the balance of these things stays within tolerable ranges, thanks to two factors: an active community which cares greatly about preserving this place for intended purpose ( https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html ); and an owner (Y Combinator) that pays us to work on the site full time and mainly just wants us to keep it good, to the extent possible. If you really want to figure this place out, the way to do it is as a reader . Hang out on the site, look at the mix of articles that make the frontpage, spend time in the discussion threads (hopefully the interesting sectors and not the flamey ones!), and over time your eyes will adjust. What doesn't work—and this is good because we want it not to work—is approaching HN as a platform for promoting content. If you (<-- I don't mean you personally, but anyone) mainly care about \"how can I use this thing to get attention for my startup/blog/project/newsletter\", then you're operating in 'push' mode rather than 'pull' mode (or 'idle' mode, which is even better).

Honestly hackernews to me is a place where tinkering as a hobby is appreciated. I have read so many large threads here and ended up sometimes having a new point of view on something and so many posts here which make me want to be curious and tinker around too. I cannot really name something exactly which clicks on hackernews but that is what makes it unique and this does mean I cannot explain it to others sometimes since my hobbies are tangential to hackernews too, I just end up saying my hobby is tinkering with computers (currently only software) reply",

There’s a handful of ideas we’re collectively mulling over at any given time. They slowly rotate in and out, and modulate into different keys as they go. For instance, the leading edge of LLM related discourse seems to be improving now that we’re getting bored with both hype and outrage, although there’s still plenty of hype and outrage. Old topics still occasionally blip into focus, but they don’t have the same staying power. Like, you’ll see a Rails post every now and then, but it’s not the darling it was. I doubt we’ll ever see the likes of “Rails is a Ghetto” make the rounds again, because nobody’s worked up about it any more. Or take Skrillex, who must have been on the front page every week for a month. I was annoyed at the time, but I think we’re due for a retrospective on programmers and dubstep. I’m not the one to write it though; not my scene in the first place. Anyway, thank you dang for your moderation! reply",

It got the experience I needed and after the first year and changing jobs, my pay substantially increased. I realize not everyone can take the approach I took. It may not even work these days. I did this 38 years ago when the industry was a bit more accepting of developers without a college degree. Addendum: I also networked. I went to the equivalent of meet ups of the day.

Bonus of using an open source kernel is they have a lot of eyeballs on them. They will be pretty dialed in versus studying random Github projects that happen to be written in C.

All of this is done in a Python environment with usage of Rust for speeding up critical code/computations. (The rust code is delivered as Python modules.) The work is interesting and different challenges arise when having to process and compute datasets that are updated with 10s of TBs of fresh data daily. reply",

Once you get up to embedded Linux basically any language can be used. I have a really smart colleague who is interested in Zig but I’m hesitant to make such an investment without (1) the stronger guarantees of Rust and (2) the larger embedded dev community around Rust. At the end of the day we don’t usually write our own peripheral drivers anymore, so it’s important to have good BSP support for your language. So whatever you use, you usually have to wrap the C. This is even true of using C! The vendors libs are usually pretty bad and need wrapping with safety checks, or to be made so you can run more than one instance, etc. reply",

Granted there is some web-stuff involved (one of the clients involved is Web-RTC), but it is mainly VoIP protocols among non-web or even 3rd party clients. Working with a stateful and complex protocol like SIP is fun and a pain. You need stateful load balancers, traffic routing can be tricky (f.ex. in k8s...), interoperability between providers is not trivial, etc. We also use relatively niche protocols for real-time text over RTP, which isn't (or until recently, hasn't been) supported in much VoIP software. This is starting to change due to EU legislation requiring accessibility in all commercial PSTN services, however. The market for this type of tech was very small ~15-20 years ago. Thus, the company was comitting to every possible sales lead, leaving a right mess in tech debt. So much of the work is handling and working around that... Much of the product pre-dates viable, affordable 3rd party technology, so there are home-grown components for all sorts of things: conferencing media component that also supports text, RTP proxies that were needed because few 3rd party clients supported ICE or TURN, etc. Stateful and complex protocols, with home-grown bespoke software components, 3rd party interoperability, 15-20 years  of technical debt, and changing customer demands.

They can also execute precisely controlled stimulation sequences, which allows information to be presented to the neurons. Then there are a lot of higher level application APIs to handle things like recording data, real-time visualisation, and experiment config management. Why: it appears to be possible to teach neurons to perform tasks (we taught some to play pong several years ago).

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I have been noticing several issues with GitHub over the last few weeks, most of which used to work flawlessly a few months ago.<p>The outages aside, a couple of annoying, super-recent experiences:<p>- Our release process involves creating draft releases before QA, and publishing them when ready. We published a new release today and team members from the US were able to see it as published while members from different countries still saw the release marked as a draft and not visible publicly. We only noticed it two hours after making our announcements. We had to unpublish and publish it again to fix it.<p>- Recently, a colleague noticed a number of unrelated changes while reviewing a diff on GitHub, which led to us reverting a merge, only to later notice that the commit itself had no issues and it was the GitHub UI.<p>Outages and major issues are fine, they are loud and addressed directly. These kinds of issues go unnoticed, and they reduce trust silently.<p>I no longer trust the GitHub interface and actions. We had to re-test our release assets manually to make sure GH didn't mess that up.<p>Could this be yet another result of trusting AI code too much without proper review and testing? While discussing internally, one of my colleagues mentioned that \"the whole internet feels fragile lately\".<p>I'm curious to hear if anyone else has been facing such weird issues with GitHub.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Named ranges! Also newer Excel versions provide you the LET function, which is neat for documentation (naming) of intermediate steps: =LET(data; F4:F34;\n       dummy1; \"This is a made up average function; this string is ignored\";\n       dummy2; \"one limitation is that you cant really overwrite variable names\";\n       tally; COUNTA(data);\n       total; SUM(data);\n       total/tally) It also avoids recomputing intermediate stuff. You can also encapsulate things in a LAMBDA anonymous function: =LET(data; F4:F34;\n       mymeanfunction; LAMBDA(data;\n                              LET(tally; COUNTA(data);\n                                  total; SUM(data);\n                                  total/tally));\n       mean1; mymeanfunction(data);\n       mean2; mymeanfunction(OFFSET(data;0;1));doc;\"FIXME, this should have its own variable name to refer explicitly to G4:G34\";\n       AVERAGE(mean1;mean2)) You could also move the LAMBDA to the name registry and use that function similarly to how you would use a named range or a built-in formula! Coming from a lisp background, I was ecstatic to see this, but they have heavy technical limitations. I did play a little bit though with these concepts and the dynamic array functions. Fun functions to explore: - DROP, TAKE, CHOOSECOLS, CHOOSEROWS to cut arrays\n  - INDEX, OFFSET, COLUMN, ROW to navigate\n  - WRAPCOLS, WRAPROWS, TOROW, TOCOL, VSTACK, HSTACK, TRANSPOSE to shape arrays\n  - MAP, SCAN, REDUCE to compute on top of arrays There's more! reply",

The limitation I keep feeling is less about expressiveness and more about working with existing formulas:\ndebugging, making small changes, or explaining intent to someone else. Even with LET/LAMBDA, the structure still lives mostly in a single line of text,\nand the formula bar UI doesn’t really help you reason about that structure.\nThat’s the gap I’ve been curious about exploring. reply",

          "text": "Yes, I don't think Excel product owners are focusing on professional development, just power users. So things like the formula bar are lackluster. There is also a formula stepper that's mostly useless for debugging. I played with them and even tried to build a minikanren, but on my day to day job I just use them tactically, so I avoid their limitations and I'm quite happy with them for that. From memory: - Recursion is severely limited in lambda.\n  - There are extra pains when putting formulas on the name manager or on conditional formatting (although more focused on references than on lambdas in particular, usage of lambda would be more powerful if they didn't exist)\n  - You can't do arrays of arrays, so your data structures need to be flat reply",
