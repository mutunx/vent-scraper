      "content": {
        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I was listening to an old postcast from 2021 which discusses the inexplicable rise of Python.<p>I remember much of the positive sentiment around Python in the early days being less about Python and more about how powerful Perl is but Perl is Perl. Python being the nice and clean version of Perl meant it got all all the praise of Perl while enjoying the reputation of having none of the failings of Perl. In hindsight I think Python needed to stand on its own right, not just as a better Perl, but yet here we are. I think hindsight will show we should have considered the defects of Python more deeply. I know the lispers saw them but no one listens to them. Today Python is most dominant language on the planet and Perl is all but forgotten.<p>If you survey the language landscape now, a language can be much better than Python but never get the chance Python did just because it happened to look a bit better than Perl. Which is absurd to me.</p></p></div>",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Today is the worst day of my life. We live in a country near Cambodia, and as you know, it is kind of a dream land for scammers. Today, it happened to my family.<p>My mother received a call from a scammer. They told her she needed to process some tax issue and prove that her bank account had enough money. In just a few minutes, they tricked her and manipulated her into entering banking OTP codes. All of her savings are now gone.<p>What makes this more dramatic is that last year I architected and helped a government department in my country build a big system. This system can track money flows across the whole country, to know where money comes from. I was very proud of this. It is the biggest achievement of my life. Even if nobody knows I built it, that was fine.<p>But now I cannot protect my own mother. I cannot protect my family. My system can track the money, but it is almost impossible to get it back.<p>When I went to the police, just in one small area, there were more than 20 cases in a single day. A hardworking student sent all their family's money, thinking it was for university fees or going abroad. An old factory worker lost all her retirement savings. So many people lost everything. That is when I realized that the system I built, the system I was proud of, is not enough.<p>All my own savings are gone too. (My mother was scammed into borrowing a lot of money and sending it to the scammers, and now it is my responsibility.) I had plans for the next few years: to do open source work, to write books about math and programming, to create a dream Go web framework, to give back to the community. Now all of that is gone.<p>But this is not only about me. I can still start over. I am strong enough to rebuild my life. But who will protect people like my mother? Or a poor student? Or a factory worker? Or so many others?<p>I can build systems. I can build distributed systems that scale to a whole country. But for what? What should I do?<p>I have been reading Hacker News for 12 to 13 years, sometimes posting from other accounts. I am writing here now to ask for advice and help from this community.<p>If anyone has experience with similar cases, or ideas on what can realistically be done, or even advice on how to move forward after something like this, I would really appreciate it. I will keep this account semi-private, because with the details above, I think some engineers from my country may recognize me.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

She had to come out of retirement and go back to work because of it. I think crimes like this are among the most evil you can commit to people. I really wish that law enforcement organizations would chase these down and prosecute as aggressively as they would if there had been a murder or something committed. They are fully capable of doing so when it's something that they care enough about, but they just don't seem to care about people like your mother and my friend.

Click on any function call then the callee shows up in a new window with proper highlighting. Click on a struct object it immediately shows the struct def in a panel stick to the bottom of the screen. Essentially, it’s like VSCode Peek definition but with a different visual style, and similar to the same functionality of source insight but free and in Linux. The purpose is to read xv6 source code. I have found some parts of the kernel, e.g. the file system to be convoluted, and I need to follow quite a few jumps to form the system mindset. Having such a small tool is very helpful. Actually it doesn’t look too hard to implement. Maybe I’ll write it myself in QT. reply",

Do you think one of the main factors is meeting new people/the sense of community? Anyway good job! I'm not sure what your margins are but it's probably more than 500/month! Congrats! reply",

I’m just going to bullet some of them out in no particular order: - We do the work to find the restaurant and curate a menu, story, and theme. E.g., we might go to an Indian restaurant and focus the event on only the southern regional dishes. - Many times we have dishes that are off menu specially for our event. - Sense of community. We have quite a few regulars who have gotten to know each other. In 2025, 45 people reached their 20th or 30th event with us. Since we take over the whole restaurant there’s a little more freedom in how the space is used. Lots of new friendships have been forged. - When you go to a restaurant with a friend or small group, you can only order so much. We’ve had events with upwards of 25 different bites. There’s really no better way to sample everything the restaurant has to offer. - There’s a few people who say their partner are picky eaters, so they come to our event each month to have the opportunity to be a bit more adventurous. It’s an incredibly diverse group with a lot of different reasons to attend. reply",

          "text": "My partner and I divide and conquer. He focuses on front of house and I handle the backoffice. The process starts ~3 months before the event. We start by picking a theme or region. Then contact some restaurants that fit the criteria and pitch them the event. That kicks off the back and forth on cost and menu. Around 4 weeks before the event we send a save the date + previous event recap email. We summarize the last event and tease the next event, without giving away the actual resturant or type of food. Over the next week we prep the invite email and payment forms. This requires putting the dishes on our menu template, research and writing about the history of the dishes, the region, and the resturant. Some of this content also goes onto our website. Three weeks out we send the invite, which is a lottery system. Members have 5 days to request a seat and place a credit card hold. 5 days later we run the lottery (I wrote some basic software to randomize assignment, conver the card auth to capture and release any cards that didn't get assigned a ticket). Then we send an email to everyone who got in with which night they recieved and another email to anyone who was waitlisted. Everyone is added to a spreadsheet to track. 1 week before the event we send a reminder email and a last chance to cancel before the ticket is non refundable. At the event we play host and check each guest in and say hi to everyone. Then we give a prepared ~5 min intro about the food, restaurant, celebrate any milestone members, and make any general house keeping accounments. Our 20 club members get a branded apron. At the event we take video and pictures. Over the course of the next 4 weeks we post dish pictures with descriptions and history of the dish on our instagram. We also make a 1-2 min recap video of the event which also goes on our instagram and website. Separate from the actual event related work we have to manage the books, handle members emails, and review membership requests. More recently we started selling shirts, so there's a little work in managing that as well. reply",

We also have an unbelievably respectful and mature community. After over 70 seatings we’ve never had an incident. We also have a code of conduct document we send all new members. Second, we setup an LLC to shield us personally from legal liability. Third, not to say that it shields us, but the restaurants also have insurance and are a better target for a lawsuit.

The compute would differ, but loading speed shouldn't be an issue if you can render the HTML first, and hydrate it after page load. This static HTML would then also serve as fallback when Javascript is disabled. - For a quick demo, I doubt you will lose people by embedding an older version. Serving a version of a few months ago seems like 80% of the work, with 20% of the effort, in terms of deployment. Anyhow, nice to see government funds put to a good cause! reply",

          "text": "There's a really awesome site called Librivox [1], where volunteers narrate books that are in the public domain. Those recordings are also in the public domain as well (this is just part of the Librivox thing). The quality of those recordings (both the narration, and the actual recording quality) varies quite a bit and most of them aren't at a quality I'd expect people to pay for and thus aren't useable for me. I've spent hours and hours sorting through those recordings finding the best ones (from a narration perspective) and then improving the recording/audio quality on them. Those recordings have all mostly been made in the last 20yrs, so they're not old recordings of the books. So, the value I add to the Librivox recordings are: curation/selection, audio enhancement, and a much better delivery mechanism (IMHO). I'm also simultaneously building out our own library of original audio content by working with voice actors to get them recorded and proof read (this is a very expensive and time consuming process, but also very fun). One of the hardest parts is honestly the proofing process. Once I get finished narration files I have to compare them result with the actual script (as there are always mistakes) and request edits. I use whisper.cpp to transcribe them and then git and a few other scripts to compare the transcript with the actual book text. I'll also add that I _do not_ use AI Audio narration because it just doesn't sound good IMHO, and I personally hate listening to it. I regularly run experiments to see what the current state of the tech is and it's still pretty far from where it needs to be IMO. I also don't love the idea of AI swallowing absolutely everything. I appreciate the feedback and compliment! [1] https://librivox.org/ reply",

What it does - Exact duplicate detection using incremental hashing so it doesn’t have to fully load huge files. - Perceptual image matching finds similar images even if they’re resized or lightly edited (not just byte-for-byte duplicates). - Native macOS integration with a Finder right-click scan. Why I built it: My brother kept running out of space because of tons of photos, and every existing tool I tried either missed similar images or was slow and clunky - so I spent a couple of weekends building something that felt fast, accurate, and native. Business side - Free trial (no CC required). - Paid tiers: ~$5.99/yr or ~$16.99 lifetime. Got positive feedback and 100+ paying users shortly after launch. Been growing steadily ever since.

Attention spans will drop even lower, causing severe psychological problems. Think 'Digital Dementia 2.0.' Later, LLMs will be portrayed as something evil, yet everyone will still use them. Parents will use them, while telling their kinds not to do so. Leetcode is already standard for SWE interviews, but other industries will need to adopt similar tests to verify that an applicant's brain is functioning correctly and that they're capable of doing the job. Maybe a formal confirmation from a psychologist specializing in 'fried brains' will be required. reply",

And amongst my peers, especially those without a background in IT, misunderstanding and anthropomorphising has made this even worse. I think for people who already have great skills, AI will probably be helpful, not harmful.

AI just enables you to work on bigger problems because you’re not spending so much time “calculating by hand”.

LLMs start feeling like databases or cloud compute. No SpaceX or OpenAI IPO moment. Capital markets quietly reward the boring winners instead. S&P 500 grinds out another double digit year, mostly because earnings keep up and alternatives still look worse. Tech discourse stays apocalyptic, but balance sheets don't. If you mute politics and social media noise, 2026 probably looks like one of those years that we later remember as \"stable\" in retrospect. Bonus: Bitcoin sees both 50k and 150k. reply",

Elite universities will continue to do well but the value there becomes elitism and social status (this has been apparent for a long while already). Value of experience will grow - compounding this will be less opportunity for junior people to get that experience so they will be increasingly (and rightly) frustrated. The opportunities to have a successful career as a salaried employee decline significantly - people are pushed to start small businesses out of necessity - and this barrier is lower due to AI. A flurry of new dev tooling companies start up re-packaging software development processes and concepts into a more user friendly package that allows software development to go even more mainstream to accommodate this. reply",

I really feel \"web dev\" is going to get highly commoditized by GenAI, by web dev I mean 99% of building CRUD-adjacent apps, we are already seeing it now with tools like Claude Code etc, this pipeline is just going to get more refined, with tigther testing feedback loops, PR-workflows and a CI/CD deployment pipeline which the GenAI will control. This might be amplified by the fact the sheer amount of tested, high quality there is in the JavaScript-ecosystem for the AI to train on and learn from. Software engineering in general will tend more systems and embedded software, fields where GenAI can't perform well or can't be trusted to produce good code (I am thinking writing device drivers, or maintainence of legacy C applications) as well as deep research fields. The average software engineering job might be either that of a \"technical product manager\", or \"researcher\" or \"low-level systems expert\" That's just what I feel. Honestly, I am probably much younger an others on this forum, so I haven't really seen this industry \"evolve\" this is just how it looks to me now. I believe there was a time in the early 2010s where there was a boom of this \"generalist developer\" where if you knew your JavaScript-ecosystem (or App Dev ecosystem for that matter) pretty well, you could land a pretty decent job right out of college, or without a college degree at all. To me, at this stage the world in general needs software engineers who understand the \"world\" if that makes sense (in terms of physics, mathematics), or who have a really good mental model of computation. Better put, software engineering will become a tool in the larger context of research & development of tech that advance humanity. reply",

I have observed many roles like SRE etc, require certain experience which is hard to get by working on your own projects without much traction; similiar case for cybersec but to a lesser extent.

Yes that's true but I would argue this isn't because of AI itself. Sure it might have accelerated it but I have heard that in the 2020's a lot of people got a lot of jobs in the industry and then its that the market did feel saturated and in a sense, a lot of jobs feel this way in the economy where if someone has it, they continue having it but its becoming harder for new people to enter, there are financials reasons for this too mostly if i remember, interests rates are one of the core reasons That being said, Even though I have used LLM's a lot, I do not agree with your opinion and I am even younger than you most likely (17) A lot of people my age/people just going into college would use AI a lot to cheat but I will genuinely try to take it slow to learn things. I will try to use it as a learning tool and not as a crutch. Currently I am still in high school and I get ideas which I wish to implement but dont have the time because of exams so I test them out with LLM's but even I find the whole process frustrating at times and its just, maybe its me but there is a good ceiling that I can process. Some basic crud processes can definitely be in that but if your project is novel, even basic things can be hard I will give you an example, I recently tried creating an api for proton docs which worked by having browser instances. I had two basic scripts that worked on one platform and converted them to puppeteer using LLM and after it worked, I then asked it to simply create a very basic crud api on top of it Nope, I tried it 5-6 times on the best models on the market but they couldn't actively take two files which had read/write and have it work, either there was an issue in read or an issue in write I am fine with the project as it is right now and I am fine with the templates it has given me and I am going to build it now on top of it I had many ideas which could be considered basic crud apps like having a kanban app/github issues like ui on top of bitwarden after I saw a post here by simon saying how he uses github issues and that went semi-viral on hackernews Another issue is that I think just as how sure writers and similar can generate AI generated, I feel like there would be more trust on the non AI generated code. Personally I will try my best to create prototypes with AI and if I like them, I will see what it does and then rewrite them myself as an learning experience and also because people say spec driven development etc. but I just want to code things by hand at this point or convert the LLM generated prototypes of idea to something that I later code and understand by hand tbh (most likely when I get into college) reply",

          "text": "I wrote a lot. Let me add a tldr: any international trades happening in non-US dollar is an \"acceleration\" of dedollarizatiom, given that currently all trade is dollarized. Original: I don't known if I understand the spirit of the question. There are no metrics or tracking of how \"dollarized\" the international economy is because virtually all trade is done in dollars and there has been no risk of this changing for the past ?65? years My original prediction for 2026 ( not 2025, mind you) made in 2024 was based on a few factors, if I recall correctly, 1) the Russia-Ucraine war and related sanctions; 2) the open discussion in BRICS about trade in direct currencies; and 3) the then-promised isolatonist policies of Trump's second mandate. What we've seen in 2025 makes all of those stronger I guess. 1) I don't know the status of the Russia-Ucraine war; all I know is it is a glaring sign of the end of Pax Americana (as is the Israel-Palestine genocide/war, by the way, which the US would -not- have allowed given the strong internal opposition and negative popularity among the American public). So sanctions of Russia notwistanding, that status quo, which strongly related to dollar as reserve currency, is either agonizing or dead. 2) Trump and the US attempted a very strong response to the (first ever?) trades in local currency between Brazil and China, mostly in the form of targeted tariffs (all discourse about Bolsonaro and whatever being the motivation for tariffing Brazilian imports being, in my opinion, political smoke and mirrors). I don't think it worked. I think BRICS might press on this. If the mercosur/EU trade deal goes through it will also be a strong force towards trade in Euros/Reais/Pesos directly I believe. 3) I don't think I need to clarify; tariffs and other issues brought on by the current US government were severely negative to the placement of the US as a preferred trade partner. This is to beyond economic choice; active anti-american sentiment are at all times high in countries like Canada, Denmark, and Mexico, all historically aligned with the US. This may not seem that relevant but come election cycles in those and other countries we might see platforms/candidates that openly propose to \"secede\" from the US hegemony international order. If that happens, removing US military bases is a first go. Alternatives to the US \"petrodollar\" a close second. reply",

The core issue is structural: most cryptocurrencies depend on foundations that fund development, marketing, and operations through large token holdings. When prices fall, these entities eventually become forced sellers. At some point, their “whale power” is not optional but necessary to survive, creating persistent sell pressure and undermining long-term trust. Bitcoin likely has a longer lifespan than most alternatives due to its lack of a foundation, fixed monetary policy, and social inertia. Over time, it may absorb whatever residual trust exists in the broader crypto space. However, that does not imply indefinite relevance: Bitcoin could survive while gradually becoming economically marginal, not dead, but increasingly negligible outside niche use cases. reply",

Or to put it another way, the thing you do is to solve the actual problems other people have. That's what you need to sell. You aren't selling the fact that you know how to use a hammer. You are selling the idea that you can build the right hammer for the job. So sales is not \"out reach.\" It is \"what do you need?\" and you will probably do better by optimizing for getting to that conversation, not through optimizing for low effort on your part. Linked-in is best used for networking not push notification. Networking is about trust. Maybe you can't help with someone's problem but you know someone who can. Finally, you can't sell desperately.

I've made friends here, have been helped by people on projects that I was busy with, did the reverse, found friends and business partners and spend way too much time. HN is a very interesting slice of the online world, a place that is unlike the rest, sometimes a bit dry but always interesting and extremely useful. If you're looking at it to try to understand it then you might as well try to understand a rat or a mouse. You won't understand it because it isn't there to be understood, it just is, like any other organism. The root of HN is a thing called 'startup news', that was changed very quickly and since then HN has been a focal point for techies of all sorts but also lots of other people from all walks of life and from a large variety of countries. It isn't 'one thing' to everybody that participates, just like a hammer is a different thing for a carpenter than it is for a masoner or a farmer. The fact that after being a member for a couple of years you have this question indicates a lack of participation, not a lack of understanding. reply",

          "text": "> Hacker news is there to promote ycombinator companies I should probably clarify this a bit. It's true that HN sponsors Launch HNs (and Show HNs) by YC startups. This is in the FAQ: https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html . However, YC would not be funding HN if that were the only reason for it. It's a secondary factor. Far more important than promoting existing startups is attracting founders who might start new startups. This requires an entirely different strategy than promotion: it requires being interesting enough to attract the right kind of users. That's why the site is organized around curiosity, as I explained elsewhere in the current thread ( https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46309399 ). For more on this, here are past explanations: optimizing for curiosity - https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&sor... relationship between HN and YC's business interests - https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=false&so... reply",

We literally give exactly the same information and help to YC-funded startups as we do to non-YC-funded startups who ask for assistance with their Show HNs. That's because giving “extra help” to YC-funded startups is far less valuable (to everyone including the startup themselves [1]) than just making HN interesting to readers and showcasing cool projects, no matter who has built them. [1] More than almost anything else, what I've learned from moderating HN is that “extra help” to get onto the front page of HN is of barely any help at all. That is, if the post isn't interesting enough to earn significant numbers of upvotes and good comments very quickly, it will disappear off the front page very quickly. Also, any time a story is on the front page that the community doesn’t think belongs there, it feels off and attracts flags and complaints. reply",

I've also seen people associated with YC backed companies here downvoted into the toilet for spouting unpopular opinions. The only thing that possibly could happen (and that would be fairly hard to detect) is brigading on a company level, but I would accuse the likes of Google and Apple of that long before I would do so with the YC mods. Think about the opportunity cost of moderating this site. If you take that into account and then combine what you know of Dan and Tom with them selling out their integrity for a pittance if it would come to light that they did so it would wreck their reputation, which is pretty much the only compensation they really get here.

I've always been a fan of analyzing all of the flags retro-actively to see if they were just or not and to have a per-subject matrix that would weigh flags from particular users.

I’m not the person you asked the question of - but I think the purpose of ycombinator is to give relevant people a place to discuss things aligned with the ecosystem in which ycombinator operates, to help strengthen and champion that ecosystem. Does it have a payoff for ycombinator? Almost certainly. Was it created with that explicit purpose in mind? I doubt it. There are easier ways to make money. reply",

If we take what he wrote at face value, I don’t think the purpose was primarily its promotional value. https://paulgraham.com/hackernews.html _ Hacker News was two years old last week. Initially it was supposed to be a side project—an application to sharpen Arc on, and a place for current and future Y Combinator founders to exchange news._ _ Hacker News is an experiment, and an experiment in a very young field. Sites of this type are only a few years old. Internet conversation generally is only a few decades old. So we've probably only discovered a fraction of what we eventually will._ _ Hacker News is definitely useful. I've learned a lot from things I've read on HN. I've written several essays that began as comments there. So I wouldn't want the site to go away. But I would like to be sure it's not a net drag on productivity. What a disaster that would be, to attract thousands of smart people to a site that caused them to waste lots of time._ reply",

As to how I (or anyone) could show this, here are a few example questions: 1. How many examples of stealthy but otherwise blatant promotion do you see in the comments? Not every astroturfing campaign will be successful or original, so you'd be able to notice some patterns. Plus, HN is already commercially oriented, and there's the \"Show HN\" option, so it reduces the incentives for astroturfing. 2. Alternatively, how much controversy is there around the specific type of forum? For some subreddits, for example, you'd be able to see counter-subreddits popping up when participants feel the mods are abusing their power to promote one type of opinion. 3. Is a certain type of political/brand-related opinion or interpretation always at the top of your comment feed? For example, if upvotes determine the order of the comments, do you consistently see fewer critical comments on things that you'd expect the community to react to in different ways. 4. Do you consistently see some contributors having more power in discussions over others? Other than the mods, obviously. If this is the case, karma (i.e., number of upvotes) often has more value. Still, I could be wrong. reply",

          "text": "(I'm a mod here) It's true that this place can be cryptic, and that has downsides—specifically, it can be confusing to newcomers, even to some newcomers who would make ideal HN users. That sucks. But there's a key that unlocks most of the puzzles. That is to understand that we're optimizing for exactly one thing: curiosity. (Specifically, intellectual curiosity, since there are other kinds of curiosity too.) Here are links to past explanations about that: https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&sor... We try to elevate things that gratify curiosity: creative work, surprising discoveries, deep dives, technical achievements, unusual personal experience, whimsical unpredictability, good conversation, etc. And we try to demote things that run against curiosity, especially repetition, indignation, sensationalism, and promotion. It gets complicated because you'll also see plenty of repetition, indignation, sensationalism, and promotion on HN—alas! This is the internet after all. But the site survives because the balance of these things stays within tolerable ranges, thanks to two factors: an active community which cares greatly about preserving this place for intended purpose ( https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html ); and an owner (Y Combinator) that pays us to work on the site full time and mainly just wants us to keep it good, to the extent possible. If you really want to figure this place out, the way to do it is as a reader . Hang out on the site, look at the mix of articles that make the frontpage, spend time in the discussion threads (hopefully the interesting sectors and not the flamey ones!), and over time your eyes will adjust. What doesn't work—and this is good because we want it not to work—is approaching HN as a platform for promoting content. If you (<-- I don't mean you personally, but anyone) mainly care about \"how can I use this thing to get attention for my startup/blog/project/newsletter\", then you're operating in 'push' mode rather than 'pull' mode (or 'idle' mode, which is even better).

Honestly hackernews to me is a place where tinkering as a hobby is appreciated. I have read so many large threads here and ended up sometimes having a new point of view on something and so many posts here which make me want to be curious and tinker around too. I cannot really name something exactly which clicks on hackernews but that is what makes it unique and this does mean I cannot explain it to others sometimes since my hobbies are tangential to hackernews too, I just end up saying my hobby is tinkering with computers (currently only software) reply",

There’s a handful of ideas we’re collectively mulling over at any given time. They slowly rotate in and out, and modulate into different keys as they go. For instance, the leading edge of LLM related discourse seems to be improving now that we’re getting bored with both hype and outrage, although there’s still plenty of hype and outrage. Old topics still occasionally blip into focus, but they don’t have the same staying power. Like, you’ll see a Rails post every now and then, but it’s not the darling it was. I doubt we’ll ever see the likes of “Rails is a Ghetto” make the rounds again, because nobody’s worked up about it any more. Or take Skrillex, who must have been on the front page every week for a month. I was annoyed at the time, but I think we’re due for a retrospective on programmers and dubstep. I’m not the one to write it though; not my scene in the first place. Anyway, thank you dang for your moderation! reply",

It got the experience I needed and after the first year and changing jobs, my pay substantially increased. I realize not everyone can take the approach I took. It may not even work these days. I did this 38 years ago when the industry was a bit more accepting of developers without a college degree. Addendum: I also networked. I went to the equivalent of meet ups of the day.

Bonus of using an open source kernel is they have a lot of eyeballs on them. They will be pretty dialed in versus studying random Github projects that happen to be written in C.

All of this is done in a Python environment with usage of Rust for speeding up critical code/computations. (The rust code is delivered as Python modules.) The work is interesting and different challenges arise when having to process and compute datasets that are updated with 10s of TBs of fresh data daily. reply",

Once you get up to embedded Linux basically any language can be used. I have a really smart colleague who is interested in Zig but I’m hesitant to make such an investment without (1) the stronger guarantees of Rust and (2) the larger embedded dev community around Rust. At the end of the day we don’t usually write our own peripheral drivers anymore, so it’s important to have good BSP support for your language. So whatever you use, you usually have to wrap the C. This is even true of using C! The vendors libs are usually pretty bad and need wrapping with safety checks, or to be made so you can run more than one instance, etc. reply",

Granted there is some web-stuff involved (one of the clients involved is Web-RTC), but it is mainly VoIP protocols among non-web or even 3rd party clients. Working with a stateful and complex protocol like SIP is fun and a pain. You need stateful load balancers, traffic routing can be tricky (f.ex. in k8s...), interoperability between providers is not trivial, etc. We also use relatively niche protocols for real-time text over RTP, which isn't (or until recently, hasn't been) supported in much VoIP software. This is starting to change due to EU legislation requiring accessibility in all commercial PSTN services, however. The market for this type of tech was very small ~15-20 years ago. Thus, the company was comitting to every possible sales lead, leaving a right mess in tech debt. So much of the work is handling and working around that... Much of the product pre-dates viable, affordable 3rd party technology, so there are home-grown components for all sorts of things: conferencing media component that also supports text, RTP proxies that were needed because few 3rd party clients supported ICE or TURN, etc. Stateful and complex protocols, with home-grown bespoke software components, 3rd party interoperability, 15-20 years  of technical debt, and changing customer demands.

They can also execute precisely controlled stimulation sequences, which allows information to be presented to the neurons. Then there are a lot of higher level application APIs to handle things like recording data, real-time visualisation, and experiment config management. Why: it appears to be possible to teach neurons to perform tasks (we taught some to play pong several years ago).

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">I have been noticing several issues with GitHub over the last few weeks, most of which used to work flawlessly a few months ago.<p>The outages aside, a couple of annoying, super-recent experiences:<p>- Our release process involves creating draft releases before QA, and publishing them when ready. We published a new release today and team members from the US were able to see it as published while members from different countries still saw the release marked as a draft and not visible publicly. We only noticed it two hours after making our announcements. We had to unpublish and publish it again to fix it.<p>- Recently, a colleague noticed a number of unrelated changes while reviewing a diff on GitHub, which led to us reverting a merge, only to later notice that the commit itself had no issues and it was the GitHub UI.<p>Outages and major issues are fine, they are loud and addressed directly. These kinds of issues go unnoticed, and they reduce trust silently.<p>I no longer trust the GitHub interface and actions. We had to re-test our release assets manually to make sure GH didn't mess that up.<p>Could this be yet another result of trusting AI code too much without proper review and testing? While discussing internally, one of my colleagues mentioned that \"the whole internet feels fragile lately\".<p>I'm curious to hear if anyone else has been facing such weird issues with GitHub.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

          "text": "Named ranges! Also newer Excel versions provide you the LET function, which is neat for documentation (naming) of intermediate steps: =LET(data; F4:F34;\n       dummy1; \"This is a made up average function; this string is ignored\";\n       dummy2; \"one limitation is that you cant really overwrite variable names\";\n       tally; COUNTA(data);\n       total; SUM(data);\n       total/tally) It also avoids recomputing intermediate stuff. You can also encapsulate things in a LAMBDA anonymous function: =LET(data; F4:F34;\n       mymeanfunction; LAMBDA(data;\n                              LET(tally; COUNTA(data);\n                                  total; SUM(data);\n                                  total/tally));\n       mean1; mymeanfunction(data);\n       mean2; mymeanfunction(OFFSET(data;0;1));doc;\"FIXME, this should have its own variable name to refer explicitly to G4:G34\";\n       AVERAGE(mean1;mean2)) You could also move the LAMBDA to the name registry and use that function similarly to how you would use a named range or a built-in formula! Coming from a lisp background, I was ecstatic to see this, but they have heavy technical limitations. I did play a little bit though with these concepts and the dynamic array functions. Fun functions to explore: - DROP, TAKE, CHOOSECOLS, CHOOSEROWS to cut arrays\n  - INDEX, OFFSET, COLUMN, ROW to navigate\n  - WRAPCOLS, WRAPROWS, TOROW, TOCOL, VSTACK, HSTACK, TRANSPOSE to shape arrays\n  - MAP, SCAN, REDUCE to compute on top of arrays There's more! reply",

The limitation I keep feeling is less about expressiveness and more about working with existing formulas:\ndebugging, making small changes, or explaining intent to someone else. Even with LET/LAMBDA, the structure still lives mostly in a single line of text,\nand the formula bar UI doesn’t really help you reason about that structure.\nThat’s the gap I’ve been curious about exploring. reply",

There is also a formula stepper that's mostly useless for debugging. I played with them and even tried to build a minikanren, but on my day to day job I just use them tactically, so I avoid their limitations and I'm quite happy with them for that. From memory: - Recursion is severely limited in lambda.\n  - There are extra pains when putting formulas on the name manager or on conditional formatting (although more focused on references than on lambdas in particular, usage of lambda would be more powerful if they didn't exist)\n  - You can't do arrays of arrays, so your data structures need to be flat reply",

The lidar article from Main Street Autonomy goes beyond basics and explained everything from the ground up in such a connected way that it was a real pleasure reading it. reply",

How valid would this be given that prompts are, essentially language? How detailed does a prompt need to be to be complex intellectual property that describes a process? Can we consider it as code and an embodiment of a concept?<p>Discuss. And Happy Holidays!</p></p></div>",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Today is the worst day of my life. We live in a country near Cambodia, and as you know, it is kind of a dream land for scammers. Today, it happened to my family.<p>My mother received a call from a scammer. They told her she needed to process some tax issue and prove that her bank account had enough money. In just a few minutes, they tricked her and manipulated her into entering banking OTP codes. All of her savings are now gone.<p>What makes this more dramatic is that last year I architected and helped a government department in my country build a big system. This system can track money flows across the whole country, to know where money comes from. I was very proud of this. It is the biggest achievement of my life. Even if nobody knows I built it, that was fine.<p>But now I cannot protect my own mother. I cannot protect my family. My system can track the money, but it is almost impossible to get it back.<p>When I went to the police, just in one small area, there were more than 20 cases in a single day. A hardworking student sent all their family's money, thinking it was for university fees or going abroad. An old factory worker lost all her retirement savings. So many people lost everything. That is when I realized that the system I built, the system I was proud of, is not enough.<p>All my own savings are gone too. (My mother was scammed into borrowing a lot of money and sending it to the scammers, and now it is my responsibility.) I had plans for the next few years: to do open source work, to write books about math and programming, to create a dream Go web framework, to give back to the community. Now all of that is gone.<p>But this is not only about me. I can still start over. I am strong enough to rebuild my life. But who will protect people like my mother? Or a poor student? Or a factory worker? Or so many others?<p>I can build systems. I can build distributed systems that scale to a whole country. But for what? What should I do?<p>I have been reading Hacker News for 12 to 13 years, sometimes posting from other accounts. I am writing here now to ask for advice and help from this community.<p>If anyone has experience with similar cases, or ideas on what can realistically be done, or even advice on how to move forward after something like this, I would really appreciate it. I will keep this account semi-private, because with the details above, I think some engineers from my country may recognize me.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

They can even trick a person into selling expensive property (real estate) and then steal the money. One thing is the government must act. These calls are mostly done from abroad. Phone companies can implement some protective measures. Banks too need to watch for common patterns (doesn't always help because scammers talk the victim around the checks). The society as a whole needs to get aware. What a single person could do is to keep contact with the relatives. I've read an expert report on one such case; the author wrote that even a single close someone could break the trance and stop the scam. In that case the victim happened to be a popular singer seemingly never alone, yet as it turned out she actually was a lone old lady with not a single confidant close enough for more than a month. She was, of course, shattered with what happened (she lost close to $3M), but after some time in one if her interviews she said: \"I will survive\". She said it in Russian and did not comment on the phrase further, it must be too personal. Yet of course she meant that song. The song helps her. The song's story is different, but the emotion is same. We have all our love to give. A hard hit will do good if it makes us to commit on that. reply",

Literally her defenses were \"the buyer should've known this deal was suspect due to below the market price\" and that the buyer should have asked for a health report from a psychiatrist (wtf). Not a nice old lady after all. I haven't been following the case closely, but it seems like the decision has been overturned. Similar to Streisand Effect, there's now in Russia the term Dolina Effect [0] after this singer, referring to these \"grandma schemes\" where criminals direct the elderly to sell their property and then renege, relying on courts siding with them to keep the property and the money. Whatever the real story is, it's all so messed up. [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolina_effect reply",

One urgent warning I want to share is about how scammers are now using AI. In my country, they are already using AI for video calls, voice cloning, and highly scripted conversations. The person on the screen can look and sound real. The conversation feels natural and authoritative. For many people, especially older relatives, it is almost impossible to tell that it is fake. This is no longer about obvious scam messages or bad phone calls. AI is making scams feel personal and trustworthy. Please warn your families.

          "text": "Sorry to hear this. From where I am (India), there’s hardly anything that you can do because it’s likely that the ones with power won’t do anything. As an individual, you can only focus on yourself and those you know and try to educate them as much as is possible. These kind of scams have become a huge problem in India (look up “digital arrest” scams). People of all backgrounds and age groups have lost a lot of money (to put it in US dollar equivalent amounts, imagine a person losing few hundred thousand dollars to a couple of million dollars). There is nothing like “digital arrest” in Indian laws. The government has tried to warn people about this. The larger problem seems to be a combination of factors across disinterested entities: 1. The police aren’t interested in solving these (there’s a separate division for cybercrime). Filing a formal report is usually thwarted and avoided by the police. Even if they show some interest, it always involves paying them fat sums of money. There’s no guarantee that they can recover the money. 2. The banks aren’t interested in solving this. It seems like specific bank branch managers are involved and just stand by allowing large transactions (like cash withdrawals) to just be approved without raising any questions or concerns. All the talk by banks about “risk management” (alongside compliance matters) goes out the window just for the victims of these scams. 3. With SMS OTPs being common and the scammers recruiting some locals to run SIM farms/phone farms, the telecom companies aren’t interested in solving issues within themselves either. Though there is a limit of nine phone numbers (total) per person in India, and though there is on paper a KYC process (including a live video) to get a phone number, the telecom companies have systems and employees who can provide numerous numbers based on stolen or fake IDs. 4. The government is a bystander and appears helpless. Instead of creating laws and enforcing existing laws, it focuses on some awareness that these scams are not genuine. 5. The Supreme Court finally ordered CBI (the Indian equivalent of FBI) to investigate these scams. So there you have it: none of the entities involved has any interest or will to do something about the problem. There will always be excuses that the scammers are in another country. reply",

The best thing you can do is help to educate people, maybe create an organization that can work with other organizations to target youth and senior knowledge.

One of my grandmothers was way too knowledgeable and crafty to fall for it, even pleas like, \"Grandma, I'm in jail and need help...\" absolutely failed in practice.  For better or worse, my other Grandmother had been scammed a couple times and towards the end of her life didn't have the finances to scam any more from, living with my mom and her sisters. Unfortunately the scams themselves range from amazingly complex to what should be really easy to spot.  I make it a rule to NEVER give personal information to someone that calls me unexpectedly, at least nothing that isn't already effectively public information. Annoying when your doctor's office has an automated system that calls and the first thing it does is ask for your social security number...  My response is \"nope, not doing it\" and that's what I told anyone that would listen at that office every visit... it's training people to get scammed. reply",

The scams rely on low effort ways to find the target, robocalls, emails, etc.  But once the target is found they have to put real effort into implementation.  With AI, this will only become easier on their end. I would look into solutions that would make it harder for them.  Like AI chatbots that act like targets, both text and voice.  If the majority of their efforts end up being weeks of conversation with an AI before they figure it out then it will not be worth the effort. Right now it may take them hours to find a viable target then days to extort them.  Make it take longer, until it is more lucrative to get a legitimate job. I used to think it was fun to mess with scammers... but I think these days many of them are forced into it.  Basically they are lured in with reasonable sounding job offers then once they find themselves in another country with only their \"employer\" look out for them, they basically become slave labor.

          "text": "(If you're OP: this is not a solution per se but more of a generalist rant; just so you don't waste critical time) People talk about changing laws or technical solutions, but the inconvenient truth is that technically literate people should peer-pressure nearby friends/family/etc. into being more aware of such possibilities. I've done so, to the extent that some people find it ether borderline schizophrenic/paranoid (to my \"luck\", I live in an ex-communist country, where most people are usually skeptical in many contexts with strangers; so this group of people is relatively small). People who know better bear a responsibility towards helping others who don't; towards those who are too kind (or naive) for their own good; Even though I'm the \"tech guy\" in my close circles (family, friends,etc.) like many here, I often do the >opposite< of what other \"pro-technologists\" do these days: I don't encourage people, especially the older generation OR the more tech-illiterate ones to use more technology, because it is obvious that doing so \"injects\" another vector of attacks into their lives. More often these days this is not possible, everything gets digitalized to the detriment of such groups, but this also delves into the politics of keeping \"older options\" (cash, paper trails, etc.) available even if digitalization happens. Often times the older options are more secure, though obviously less convenient. This is a non-solution, yes, but it is the correct way to approach this (imo), as more and more places LEGALLY force digitalization of different institutions(banking, gov. agencies, etc.)  which inherently either add, or worse, completely shift the risk into virtual spaces. This is why a \"legal\" solution is more often than not either a slow one or a completely pointless one. It will always be an arms-race between scammers(which operate more effectively[in theory] due to their decentralized nature) and the gov./banks/etc., which operate in a more centralized fashion, thus demanding and imposing more control above all included parties. A legal way will always demand more than it's worth. I digress from my shift into politics, but bottom line is this: don't let your peers/family/closed ones get into these situations. If you have \"an authoritative\" voice regarding tech, use it to first cultivate awareness regarding dangers, before cultivating hype/or anything else. (Obviously not talking about anyone specifically, but the whole \"geeksphere\" as a whole) Good luck to you and your family. reply",

Myself, I have a good brain for engineering but have a marked lack of common sense. I'm a jack of all trades but as that implies I'm not particularly good at anything besides systems programming or electrical engineering. Back in college('97) a guy offered me a job as an elevator repair tech. I almost dropped out since the money was better than what I'd make as an engineer($50/hr plus OT).

There was an article posted here[0] a few years ago by an escort reflecting on her experiences, and the conclusion, which spoke to the human element of the work, deeply resonated with me - in fact, I recently left the IC track for a manager role because I'm realizing how meaningful I find work that exercises empathy to be. Human sexuality is the one thing in this world that's more interesting to me than computers, and while I'm grateful for my stable job and career that allow me to explore it as a hobby, I'm infinitely curious about what that other life would have looked like.

          "text": "Oh man, we've got a lot of similarity there!  I even took 2 weeks of PTO at one point when I was feeling massive burnout and spend that time in the shop building a table, chairs, benches, and a couple of attempts at mantles.  Chairs were a lot harder than I initially thought (mostly making them comfortable to sit in), but the table and benches were easy enough I could crank out a table in a day and two or three benches the next day. After that two weeks I even did some market research to see if there was any way to make a remotely comparable living off of it (unfortunately there wasn't, at least until the kids are out of the house and expenses go way down).  I also realized that my style was not well aligned with popular styles at the time (this was 2019), and that shipping costs basically meant I could only sell to local area (and even then delivery cost/time would require adding too much margin). Someday hopefully life will be more compatible with our dream :-) reply",

For example, when I'm building it myself I can make the walls ludicrously thick and insulated to the point where it stays a relatively moderate temp inside even without climate control.  I built a shed to use as a luxury dog house, and it was tight enough that a single small space heater could keep it quite pleasant in the winter (when outside temps would be a low of around 12 deg F and high around 28 deg F).

It's typically not recommended to self-design, the physics gets technical and there are a lot of free working plans out there including by famous naval architects. Most people start out with simpler designs using plywood and fiberglass but, due to my aforementioned disdain for a lot of modern approaches, I personally went with a traditional oak frame, cedar plank, copper rivet construction. It is very time consuming but I'm enjoying the journey. I chose a flat-bottomed sail boat design (dory) to make it a little easier on myself. There are endless variations on the concept of a \"wooden vessel that can be propelled through water\" idea so it really depends on your interests and tastes. It's a \"form follows function\" situation too, so you also need to consider your use case -- engine, oar, sail; ocean, river, lake; etc. reply",

          "text": "I’ve made some interesting things in the past few years, in particular singing Tesla coils and digitally-controlled plasma tube lights. Was thinking about making bespoke musical instruments based on some of these learnings. Of particular interest was some interesting types of feedback that came from the Tesla coils. Basically we modulated the frequency we drove the coils to produce sound, but the coils would interfere with one another because that’s how electromagnetism works. We had to tune them to different resonant frequencies to play sound. But the interference itself could sound unique and eerie, sometimes like an old-timey radio. It’s similar in principle to a theremin but a very different sound. Or I could just get a soul sucking job and do this in early retirement. Shrug. reply",

But, because it's a telco, that will be annoying and hidden. UK: OFCOM are phasing out the fax support requirement https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-and-broadband/telecoms-infra... (I slightly balked at the $5 initial price, but then realized: this is a desperation fee and I think for a lot of the users a clear fee for a clear one off service is the best deal. Anyone who wants to send 1,000 faxes will (a) be in the top 1% of fax users in their country if it's not Japan and (b) make their own arrangements. Also patio11's \"charge more\") Software wise, if you have a PBX line (which the telco will change for) you can run Asterix and then https://www.asterisk.org/products/add-ons/fax-for-asterisk/ to send as many faxes as you like to the other person in your country with a fax machine. reply",

Looking around your website it seems to me that there's very large attendance, which in my mind means generally less focus on the food itself. Do you think one of the main factors is meeting new people/the sense of community? Anyway good job! I'm not sure what your margins are but it's probably more than 500/month! Congrats! reply",

I’m just going to bullet some of them out in no particular order: - We do the work to find the restaurant and curate a menu, story, and theme. E.g., we might go to an Indian restaurant and focus the event on only the southern regional dishes. - Many times we have dishes that are off menu specially for our event. - Sense of community. We have quite a few regulars who have gotten to know each other. In 2025, 45 people reached their 20th or 30th event with us. Since we take over the whole restaurant there’s a little more freedom in how the space is used. Lots of new friendships have been forged. - When you go to a restaurant with a friend or small group, you can only order so much. We’ve had events with upwards of 25 different bites. There’s really no better way to sample everything the restaurant has to offer. - There’s a few people who say their partner are picky eaters, so they come to our event each month to have the opportunity to be a bit more adventurous. It’s an incredibly diverse group with a lot of different reasons to attend. reply",

          "text": "My partner and I divide and conquer. He focuses on front of house and I handle the backoffice. The process starts ~3 months before the event. We start by picking a theme or region. Then contact some restaurants that fit the criteria and pitch them the event. That kicks off the back and forth on cost and menu. Around 4 weeks before the event we send a save the date + previous event recap email. We summarize the last event and tease the next event, without giving away the actual resturant or type of food. Over the next week we prep the invite email and payment forms. This requires putting the dishes on our menu template, research and writing about the history of the dishes, the region, and the resturant. Some of this content also goes onto our website. Three weeks out we send the invite, which is a lottery system. Members have 5 days to request a seat and place a credit card hold. 5 days later we run the lottery (I wrote some basic software to randomize assignment, conver the card auth to capture and release any cards that didn't get assigned a ticket). Then we send an email to everyone who got in with which night they recieved and another email to anyone who was waitlisted. Everyone is added to a spreadsheet to track. 1 week before the event we send a reminder email and a last chance to cancel before the ticket is non refundable. At the event we play host and check each guest in and say hi to everyone. Then we give a prepared ~5 min intro about the food, restaurant, celebrate any milestone members, and make any general house keeping accounments. Our 20 club members get a branded apron. At the event we take video and pictures. Over the course of the next 4 weeks we post dish pictures with descriptions and history of the dish on our instagram. We also make a 1-2 min recap video of the event which also goes on our instagram and website. Separate from the actual event related work we have to manage the books, handle members emails, and review membership requests. More recently we started selling shirts, so there's a little work in managing that as well. reply",

We also have an unbelievably respectful and mature community. After over 70 seatings we’ve never had an incident. We also have a code of conduct document we send all new members. Second, we setup an LLC to shield us personally from legal liability. Third, not to say that it shields us, but the restaurants also have insurance and are a better target for a lawsuit.

The compute would differ, but loading speed shouldn't be an issue if you can render the HTML first, and hydrate it after page load. This static HTML would then also serve as fallback when Javascript is disabled. - For a quick demo, I doubt you will lose people by embedding an older version. Serving a version of a few months ago seems like 80% of the work, with 20% of the effort, in terms of deployment. Anyhow, nice to see government funds put to a good cause! reply",

          "text": "There's a really awesome site called Librivox [1], where volunteers narrate books that are in the public domain. Those recordings are also in the public domain as well (this is just part of the Librivox thing). The quality of those recordings (both the narration, and the actual recording quality) varies quite a bit and most of them aren't at a quality I'd expect people to pay for and thus aren't useable for me. I've spent hours and hours sorting through those recordings finding the best ones (from a narration perspective) and then improving the recording/audio quality on them. Those recordings have all mostly been made in the last 20yrs, so they're not old recordings of the books. So, the value I add to the Librivox recordings are: curation/selection, audio enhancement, and a much better delivery mechanism (IMHO). I'm also simultaneously building out our own library of original audio content by working with voice actors to get them recorded and proof read (this is a very expensive and time consuming process, but also very fun). One of the hardest parts is honestly the proofing process. Once I get finished narration files I have to compare them result with the actual script (as there are always mistakes) and request edits. I use whisper.cpp to transcribe them and then git and a few other scripts to compare the transcript with the actual book text. I'll also add that I _do not_ use AI Audio narration because it just doesn't sound good IMHO, and I personally hate listening to it. I regularly run experiments to see what the current state of the tech is and it's still pretty far from where it needs to be IMO. I also don't love the idea of AI swallowing absolutely everything. I appreciate the feedback and compliment! [1] https://librivox.org/ reply",

          "text": "Here’s my own side project that’s been earning a bit on the side: I built DedupX, a macOS app for finding duplicate and visually similar files fast - especially useful for photographers and anyone with big local storage collections. What it does - Exact duplicate detection using incremental hashing so it doesn’t have to fully load huge files. - Perceptual image matching finds similar images even if they’re resized or lightly edited (not just byte-for-byte duplicates). - Native macOS integration with a Finder right-click scan. Why I built it: My brother kept running out of space because of tons of photos, and every existing tool I tried either missed similar images or was slow and clunky - so I spent a couple of weekends building something that felt fast, accurate, and native. Business side - Free trial (no CC required). - Paid tiers: ~$5.99/yr or ~$16.99 lifetime. Got positive feedback and 100+ paying users shortly after launch. Been growing steadily ever since.

The opportunities to have a successful career as a salaried employee decline significantly - people are pushed to start small businesses out of necessity - and this barrier is lower due to AI.

I really feel \"web dev\" is going to get highly commoditized by GenAI, by web dev I mean 99% of building CRUD-adjacent apps, we are already seeing it now with tools like Claude Code etc, this pipeline is just going to get more refined, with tigther testing feedback loops, PR-workflows and a CI/CD deployment pipeline which the GenAI will control. This might be amplified by the fact the sheer amount of tested, high quality there is in the JavaScript-ecosystem for the AI to train on and learn from. Software engineering in general will tend more systems and embedded software, fields where GenAI can't perform well or can't be trusted to produce good code (I am thinking writing device drivers, or maintainence of legacy C applications) as well as deep research fields. The average software engineering job might be either that of a \"technical product manager\", or \"researcher\" or \"low-level systems expert\" That's just what I feel. Honestly, I am probably much younger an others on this forum, so I haven't really seen this industry \"evolve\" this is just how it looks to me now. I believe there was a time in the early 2010s where there was a boom of this \"generalist developer\" where if you knew your JavaScript-ecosystem (or App Dev ecosystem for that matter) pretty well, you could land a pretty decent job right out of college, or without a college degree at all. To me, at this stage the world in general needs software engineers who understand the \"world\" if that makes sense (in terms of physics, mathematics), or who have a really good mental model of computation. Better put, software engineering will become a tool in the larger context of research & development of tech that advance humanity. reply",

Yes that's true but I would argue this isn't because of AI itself. Sure it might have accelerated it but I have heard that in the 2020's a lot of people got a lot of jobs in the industry and then its that the market did feel saturated and in a sense, a lot of jobs feel this way in the economy where if someone has it, they continue having it but its becoming harder for new people to enter, there are financials reasons for this too mostly if i remember, interests rates are one of the core reasons That being said, Even though I have used LLM's a lot, I do not agree with your opinion and I am even younger than you most likely (17) A lot of people my age/people just going into college would use AI a lot to cheat but I will genuinely try to take it slow to learn things. I will try to use it as a learning tool and not as a crutch. Currently I am still in high school and I get ideas which I wish to implement but dont have the time because of exams so I test them out with LLM's but even I find the whole process frustrating at times and its just, maybe its me but there is a good ceiling that I can process. Some basic crud processes can definitely be in that but if your project is novel, even basic things can be hard I will give you an example, I recently tried creating an api for proton docs which worked by having browser instances. I had two basic scripts that worked on one platform and converted them to puppeteer using LLM and after it worked, I then asked it to simply create a very basic crud api on top of it Nope, I tried it 5-6 times on the best models on the market but they couldn't actively take two files which had read/write and have it work, either there was an issue in read or an issue in write I am fine with the project as it is right now and I am fine with the templates it has given me and I am going to build it now on top of it I had many ideas which could be considered basic crud apps like having a kanban app/github issues like ui on top of bitwarden after I saw a post here by simon saying how he uses github issues and that went semi-viral on hackernews Another issue is that I think just as how sure writers and similar can generate AI generated, I feel like there would be more trust on the non AI generated code. Personally I will try my best to create prototypes with AI and if I like them, I will see what it does and then rewrite them myself as an learning experience and also because people say spec driven development etc. but I just want to code things by hand at this point or convert the LLM generated prototypes of idea to something that I later code and understand by hand tbh (most likely when I get into college) reply",

          "text": "I wrote a lot. Let me add a tldr: any international trades happening in non-US dollar is an \"acceleration\" of dedollarizatiom, given that currently all trade is dollarized. Original: I don't known if I understand the spirit of the question. There are no metrics or tracking of how \"dollarized\" the international economy is because virtually all trade is done in dollars and there has been no risk of this changing for the past ?65? years My original prediction for 2026 ( not 2025, mind you) made in 2024 was based on a few factors, if I recall correctly, 1) the Russia-Ucraine war and related sanctions; 2) the open discussion in BRICS about trade in direct currencies; and 3) the then-promised isolatonist policies of Trump's second mandate. What we've seen in 2025 makes all of those stronger I guess. 1) I don't know the status of the Russia-Ucraine war; all I know is it is a glaring sign of the end of Pax Americana (as is the Israel-Palestine genocide/war, by the way, which the US would -not- have allowed given the strong internal opposition and negative popularity among the American public). So sanctions of Russia notwistanding, that status quo, which strongly related to dollar as reserve currency, is either agonizing or dead. 2) Trump and the US attempted a very strong response to the (first ever?) trades in local currency between Brazil and China, mostly in the form of targeted tariffs (all discourse about Bolsonaro and whatever being the motivation for tariffing Brazilian imports being, in my opinion, political smoke and mirrors). I don't think it worked. I think BRICS might press on this. If the mercosur/EU trade deal goes through it will also be a strong force towards trade in Euros/Reais/Pesos directly I believe. 3) I don't think I need to clarify; tariffs and other issues brought on by the current US government were severely negative to the placement of the US as a preferred trade partner. This is to beyond economic choice; active anti-american sentiment are at all times high in countries like Canada, Denmark, and Mexico, all historically aligned with the US. This may not seem that relevant but come election cycles in those and other countries we might see platforms/candidates that openly propose to \"secede\" from the US hegemony international order. If that happens, removing US military bases is a first go. Alternatives to the US \"petrodollar\" a close second. reply",

I feel like a lot of companies will see even more losses/ its not that good overall As I have said within the 2020's the interest rate was down so people hired more and there was already a hiring freeze of sorts when interest rates were raised I feel like 4-5 years down the line, interest rates can go down again and with all the other AI things seeping into reality/market corrections overall, I feel like there can be cases where using AI can panic the market and lose stock prices and so with all the other factors, I feel like employment will go up again To be honest, I dont know too much about employment, I feel like its similar to mathematics in a sense but I read books on finance and so my honest opinion is that the goal of being financially independent is to do the work that you like and I genuinely enjoy doing this work for the most part and so no matter how much it pays (which I assume to be honest would be good enough for me considering I live in third world country and I am frugal anyways) plus with all the other factors, i am pretty optimistic. I am also optimistic that I can create my own businesses much rather easily by prototyping multiple ideas with LLM generated code and then locking in on those which have a market fit to gain a sustainable cash cow. I will do these things when I get into university and then 4 years down the line, I do think that I can find something which can hopefully click but I still might do a job. In my opinion, the companies not hiring right now are gonna cause an higher issue down the line and I am confident that no matter what, I just wanna do the thing I like as a job and there are other opinions on this matter (see other comment) which are optimistic down 4-5 years and I share that opinion reply",

The core issue is structural: most cryptocurrencies depend on foundations that fund development, marketing, and operations through large token holdings. When prices fall, these entities eventually become forced sellers. At some point, their “whale power” is not optional but necessary to survive, creating persistent sell pressure and undermining long-term trust. Bitcoin likely has a longer lifespan than most alternatives due to its lack of a foundation, fixed monetary policy, and social inertia. Over time, it may absorb whatever residual trust exists in the broader crypto space. However, that does not imply indefinite relevance: Bitcoin could survive while gradually becoming economically marginal, not dead, but increasingly negligible outside niche use cases. reply",

People will sell off to buy other speculative assets, causing a price drop and accelerating sell-off from others who do not want to be bag holders until the asset reaches its intrinsic utility value. Since Bitcoin is strictly worse than alternatives as a form of payment, that value is 0.

I’ve never met anyone who can clearly explain how it works in practice. Not just the rules, but the dynamics: what’s repeatable, what’s luck, and what actually matters.<p>By using the Kevin Bacon-number idea: I can usually get within three degrees of separation of well-known technologists like Linus Torvalds, but I can’t seem to get within three steps of someone who confidently understands how HN works.<p>So I’m asking sincerely:\nDoes anyone here feel they understand Hacker News?\nIf so, what are the real levers, and what do people consistently misunderstand?<p>PS: This question comes from a mix of genuine curiosity and personal frustration. I’m honestly trying to understand how HN works in practice.</p></p></p></p></div>",

I've made friends here, have been helped by people on projects that I was busy with, did the reverse, found friends and business partners and spend way too much time. HN is a very interesting slice of the online world, a place that is unlike the rest, sometimes a bit dry but always interesting and extremely useful. If you're looking at it to try to understand it then you might as well try to understand a rat or a mouse. You won't understand it because it isn't there to be understood, it just is, like any other organism. The root of HN is a thing called 'startup news', that was changed very quickly and since then HN has been a focal point for techies of all sorts but also lots of other people from all walks of life and from a large variety of countries. It isn't 'one thing' to everybody that participates, just like a hammer is a different thing for a carpenter than it is for a masoner or a farmer. The fact that after being a member for a couple of years you have this question indicates a lack of participation, not a lack of understanding. reply",

          "text": "> Hacker news is there to promote ycombinator companies I should probably clarify this a bit. It's true that HN sponsors Launch HNs (and Show HNs) by YC startups. This is in the FAQ: https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html . However, YC would not be funding HN if that were the only reason for it. It's a secondary factor. Far more important than promoting existing startups is attracting founders who might start new startups. This requires an entirely different strategy than promotion: it requires being interesting enough to attract the right kind of users. That's why the site is organized around curiosity, as I explained elsewhere in the current thread ( https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46309399 ). For more on this, here are past explanations: optimizing for curiosity - https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&sor... relationship between HN and YC's business interests - https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=false&so... reply",

That's because giving “extra help” to YC-funded startups is far less valuable (to everyone including the startup themselves [1]) than just making HN interesting to readers and showcasing cool projects, no matter who has built them. [1] More than almost anything else, what I've learned from moderating HN is that “extra help” to get onto the front page of HN is of barely any help at all. That is, if the post isn't interesting enough to earn significant numbers of upvotes and good comments very quickly, it will disappear off the front page very quickly.

I've also seen people associated with YC backed companies here downvoted into the toilet for spouting unpopular opinions. The only thing that possibly could happen (and that would be fairly hard to detect) is brigading on a company level, but I would accuse the likes of Google and Apple of that long before I would do so with the YC mods. Think about the opportunity cost of moderating this site. If you take that into account and then combine what you know of Dan and Tom with them selling out their integrity for a pittance if it would come to light that they did so it would wreck their reputation, which is pretty much the only compensation they really get here.

I've always been a fan of analyzing all of the flags retro-actively to see if they were just or not and to have a per-subject matrix that would weigh flags from particular users.

If we take what he wrote at face value, I don’t think the purpose was primarily its promotional value. https://paulgraham.com/hackernews.html _ Hacker News was two years old last week. Initially it was supposed to be a side project—an application to sharpen Arc on, and a place for current and future Y Combinator founders to exchange news._ _ Hacker News is an experiment, and an experiment in a very young field. Sites of this type are only a few years old. Internet conversation generally is only a few decades old. So we've probably only discovered a fraction of what we eventually will._ _ Hacker News is definitely useful. I've learned a lot from things I've read on HN. I've written several essays that began as comments there. So I wouldn't want the site to go away. But I would like to be sure it's not a net drag on productivity. What a disaster that would be, to attract thousands of smart people to a site that caused them to waste lots of time._ reply",

The reason why HN is so much better than other fora (IMO) is that the mods don't allow lever-pulling and astroturfing to overtake regular contributions. Yet it's also popular, so you're bound to get some activity on most posts. Sure, it can be frustrating if you're trying to promote a product or farm karma on posts. But the fact that mostly nobody cares about karma means that you can post something and have it be evaluated on its technical, economic, social merits. Obviously, there are caveats to this - i.e., anything US- and FAANG-related is bound to get much more activity than otherwise - but the overall atmosphere of HN is refreshing compared to Reddit. reply",

          "text": "I can't know for sure. For me, it's just the \"eyeball method\" of comparing HN and different subreddits on Reddit. As to how I (or anyone) could show this, here are a few example questions: 1. How many examples of stealthy but otherwise blatant promotion do you see in the comments? Not every astroturfing campaign will be successful or original, so you'd be able to notice some patterns. Plus, HN is already commercially oriented, and there's the \"Show HN\" option, so it reduces the incentives for astroturfing. 2. Alternatively, how much controversy is there around the specific type of forum? For some subreddits, for example, you'd be able to see counter-subreddits popping up when participants feel the mods are abusing their power to promote one type of opinion. 3. Is a certain type of political/brand-related opinion or interpretation always at the top of your comment feed? For example, if upvotes determine the order of the comments, do you consistently see fewer critical comments on things that you'd expect the community to react to in different ways. 4. Do you consistently see some contributors having more power in discussions over others? Other than the mods, obviously. If this is the case, karma (i.e., number of upvotes) often has more value. Still, I could be wrong. reply",

          "text": "(I'm a mod here) It's true that this place can be cryptic, and that has downsides—specifically, it can be confusing to newcomers, even to some newcomers who would make ideal HN users. That sucks. But there's a key that unlocks most of the puzzles. That is to understand that we're optimizing for exactly one thing: curiosity. (Specifically, intellectual curiosity, since there are other kinds of curiosity too.) Here are links to past explanations about that: https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&sor... We try to elevate things that gratify curiosity: creative work, surprising discoveries, deep dives, technical achievements, unusual personal experience, whimsical unpredictability, good conversation, etc. And we try to demote things that run against curiosity, especially repetition, indignation, sensationalism, and promotion. It gets complicated because you'll also see plenty of repetition, indignation, sensationalism, and promotion on HN—alas! This is the internet after all. But the site survives because the balance of these things stays within tolerable ranges, thanks to two factors: an active community which cares greatly about preserving this place for intended purpose ( https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html ); and an owner (Y Combinator) that pays us to work on the site full time and mainly just wants us to keep it good, to the extent possible. If you really want to figure this place out, the way to do it is as a reader . Hang out on the site, look at the mix of articles that make the frontpage, spend time in the discussion threads (hopefully the interesting sectors and not the flamey ones!), and over time your eyes will adjust. What doesn't work—and this is good because we want it not to work—is approaching HN as a platform for promoting content. If you (<-- I don't mean you personally, but anyone) mainly care about \"how can I use this thing to get attention for my startup/blog/project/newsletter\", then you're operating in 'push' mode rather than 'pull' mode (or 'idle' mode, which is even better). In that case you won't be curious because you're too focused on what you're wanting for extraneous reasons—and if you aren't in a state of curiosity, this place won't make sense. At least we hope it won't! reply",

Honestly hackernews to me is a place where tinkering as a hobby is appreciated. I have read so many large threads here and ended up sometimes having a new point of view on something and so many posts here which make me want to be curious and tinker around too. I cannot really name something exactly which clicks on hackernews but that is what makes it unique and this does mean I cannot explain it to others sometimes since my hobbies are tangential to hackernews too, I just end up saying my hobby is tinkering with computers (currently only software) reply",

There’s a handful of ideas we’re collectively mulling over at any given time. They slowly rotate in and out, and modulate into different keys as they go. For instance, the leading edge of LLM related discourse seems to be improving now that we’re getting bored with both hype and outrage, although there’s still plenty of hype and outrage. Old topics still occasionally blip into focus, but they don’t have the same staying power. Like, you’ll see a Rails post every now and then, but it’s not the darling it was. I doubt we’ll ever see the likes of “Rails is a Ghetto” make the rounds again, because nobody’s worked up about it any more. Or take Skrillex, who must have been on the front page every week for a month. I was annoyed at the time, but I think we’re due for a retrospective on programmers and dubstep. I’m not the one to write it though; not my scene in the first place. Anyway, thank you dang for your moderation! reply",

I'm self taught when it comes to computers and software development. For years before I landed a paying development job I did a lot of hobby projects. When I decided to take the leap and landed my first development job I took a fairly steep cut in pay. I was single, could afford the cut and was doing something I really wanted to do. It got the experience I needed and after the first year and changing jobs, my pay substantially increased. I realize not everyone can take the approach I took. It may not even work these days. I did this 38 years ago when the industry was a bit more accepting of developers without a college degree. Addendum: I also networked. I went to the equivalent of meet ups of the day. Talked with other developers, showed them my work, etc. This is how I found my first job. reply",

With ~17 years of experience already, start with the study of the structure of C programs. Recreate some of it manually, build it, and research the things that do not behave as expected. Bonus of using an open source kernel is they have a lot of eyeballs on them. They will be pretty dialed in versus studying random Github projects that happen to be written in C. Would recommend avoiding cognitive overload, wait until you get into comfortable flow writing, building, fixing as needed, simple programs before you dive into lower level debugging, trying to grasp assembly structures that a compiler spits out. reply",

GUIs are a whole different beast in C/C++ (and are a big reason why frameworks like Electron were built). LLMs can also help you break into C development by a large degree.

Granted there is some web-stuff involved (one of the clients involved is Web-RTC), but it is mainly VoIP protocols among non-web or even 3rd party clients. Working with a stateful and complex protocol like SIP is fun and a pain. You need stateful load balancers, traffic routing can be tricky (f.ex. in k8s...), interoperability between providers is not trivial, etc. We also use relatively niche protocols for real-time text over RTP, which isn't (or until recently, hasn't been) supported in much VoIP software. This is starting to change due to EU legislation requiring accessibility in all commercial PSTN services, however. The market for this type of tech was very small ~15-20 years ago. Thus, the company was comitting to every possible sales lead, leaving a right mess in tech debt. So much of the work is handling and working around that... Much of the product pre-dates viable, affordable 3rd party technology, so there are home-grown components for all sorts of things: conferencing media component that also supports text, RTP proxies that were needed because few 3rd party clients supported ICE or TURN, etc. Stateful and complex protocols, with home-grown bespoke software components, 3rd party interoperability, 15-20 years  of technical debt, and changing customer demands.

          "text": "The neurons live on an electrode array kept inside a machine which keeps them alive (body temperature, sugar, gas, etc). The embedded system continually measures the voltage at each electrode, and can electrically stimulate the neurons via the same. Users are provided with an easy to use Python API that allows realtime observation of the raw signals and of detected action potentials (spikes). They can also execute precisely controlled stimulation sequences, which allows information to be presented to the neurons. Then there are a lot of higher level application APIs to handle things like recording data, real-time visualisation, and experiment config management. Why: it appears to be possible to teach neurons to perform tasks (we taught some to play pong several years ago). Since then our focus has been on building a system that enables rapid iteration in this sort of research. We're selling the system to organisations that have the appropriate biology skills, and renting access to hosted devices where we provide and take care of the cells. reply",

We published a new release today and team members from the US were able to see it as published while members from different countries still saw the release marked as a draft and not visible publicly. We only noticed it two hours after making our announcements. We had to unpublish and publish it again to fix it.<p>- Recently, a colleague noticed a number of unrelated changes while reviewing a diff on GitHub, which led to us reverting a merge, only to later notice that the commit itself had no issues and it was the GitHub UI.<p>Outages and major issues are fine, they are loud and addressed directly. These kinds of issues go unnoticed, and they reduce trust silently.<p>I no longer trust the GitHub interface and actions. We had to re-test our release assets manually to make sure GH didn't mess that up.<p>Could this be yet another result of trusting AI code too much without proper review and testing? While discussing internally, one of my colleagues mentioned that \"the whole internet feels fragile lately\".<p>I'm curious to hear if anyone else has been facing such weird issues with GitHub.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

So if you were going to build a competitor, you'd need to get everyone who has built a profile on linkedin and built a 20 year rolodex of their network to all migrate away. I'm not saying it cannot happen, I'm saying it is not a tech problem, so building a new flavor of the same app and hoping it wins out is an even higher-risk bet than most startups, and therefore does not fall into most people's risk tolerances. reply",

I feel like a broken record explaining this to people. The feed that appears when you go to LinkedIn.com is a sideshow. Almost nobody posts to it. Very few people read it. You can (and should!) ignore it and not miss out on anything. Make a profile. Update it occasionally when you're job searching. Forget about the site until you need it. Hit the unsubscribe button when they e-mail you suggestions. The exception is people who simply cannot resist getting pulled into a feed and scrolling it. If that's you, I understand why you'd stay off of the website. For everyone else, it's a set it and forget it until you need it kind of website. That's also why a second website isn't appealing to anyone. They've already gotten past the set-and-forget part. Why would they want to set up a second profile somewhere in a smaller, less useful network? There would have to be some real benefit, not an imagined talking point that disappoints. reply",

I am building an open-source system where everyone hosts their own site and publishes everything there from short notes, long articles, photos, whatever you want. You can auto-cross-post to those big platforms to keep your reach (Buffer for personal sites), but your site stays the single source of truth. Once enough people join, we can launch our own open feed that connects directly to the people you follow. No need for the big platforms at all. You pull updates straight from their sites in real time and move freely without losing your content or your audience. It reuses the network effects we already have while giving you true ownership and independence. This also helps people who want to escape feeds entirely: with a personal site, they can subscribe to a simple newsletter, delivered daily, weekly, or monthly with all the updates, so they stay connected without the endless scroll of social media. reply",

It's deadlock, for every thread you care about.  (2) Automation in job applications and a declining job market have both made networking more essential, so there's no tolerance for lost connections, so you'd also have to solve those problems too before all would switch.  (3)  Even if users don't like it and could surmount the coordination costs of switching, if companies continue to rely on it, switching would be a career-limiting move; and because companies cannot signal their recruitment strategies without triggering a stampede to game their system, companies tend to keep quiet, so no company would lead an exodus. Still, no one (outside influencers) likes how work networking and recruitment happens today, so user might do both linkedin and some new system if one created a more effective networking and recruitment mode (e.g., for some well-defined, high-value subset, like recent Stanford MBA's, YC alumni, FinTech, ...). reply",

By the way, these things already exist, albeit in a more niche capacity, which is a good thing. GitHub is LinkedIn for programmers. Behance is LinkedIn for designers. X is LinkedIn for AI scientists :). Etc. reply",

So once LinkedIn stops providing the value that gives it its dominance, and/or someone finds a way to deliver more value, you'll see your competition. That's your answer. Seemingly nobody has found a good enough angle or opportunity, And FWIW, sure the network effect is hard to replace, but not even close to impossible. Just ask the dozens of other social networks that have fallen from greatness.

There is no need for a contender because Linkedin is a poorly thought solution to an ill addressed problem.

          "text": "Why is there strong competition for every other social media site? This seems to come down to a few market dynamics:\n1. The major influencers who adopt it and bring their followers\n2. New networks bring new leaderboards which attract the next generation that has zero equity on the existing sites\n3. Regular engagement is critical, otherwise every network faces a death spiral\n4. Engagement required to drive ad revenue LinkedIn is notable for not being affected by these:\n1. There are no major influencers (though they tried.) The most influential person on LinkedIn is very close in value to the median software engineer\n2. There are no significant leaderboards (though they tried.) Few people care how many followers others have\n3. Regular engagement doesn't matter, because it is still the Schelling point for irregular life events (ie needing a job.) \n4. Most of their revenue comes from subscriptions for recruiters, so the lower engagement is not an existential crisis. LinkedIn is an always-on jobs expo pretending to be social media. Even the executives think they are social media. They are actually something else. Some angles to compete:\n1. Build better data for an underserved segment. Obvious choice is SWE, but MSFT owns Github as a firewall here. Another candidate is the top 1% of executives: they might be the major influencers that haven't been activated yet.\n2. Build an identity layer that mitigates risk of fake job seekers. LinkedIn has halfheartedly tried this but their inertia might be an opportunity.\n3. Build the Github for other segments: the verifiable portfolios that show real work. \n4. Build a frontrunner to the hiring pipeline. If every star candidate can be identified three months before they start looking on LinkedIn, the recruiting system there will fall apart. \n5. Build the workplace social media network that users actually want to use daily. LinkedIn failed at this, and their effort indicates they see the risk of disruption coming from here. Some existing companies that are on the right track:\n1. Slack. Already owns DAU for work, well-funded, competes with MSFT in many domains. 30% confident they've considered moving into this space, but Benioff getting AI-pilled will slow it down.\n2. Behance. Owned the market for designers, sold to Adobe, game over.\n2. Glassdoor. Useful data that LinkedIn doesn't own, but they seem to have embraced the Yelp business model instead.\n3. Fishbowl. Daily engagement solved but they've backed into a local maxima.\n4. Upwork. Stuck with low-end brand that will prevent them from winning this market.\n5. X. Has all the pieces except for a leader who cares about a jobs board. Would need a certain kind of leader for their jobs product to get it to win.\n6. Every other talent startup: fighting for the right revenue, but they almost always approach it from the transactional staffing model or the ATS subscription model. Would need someone to buy all of them up and launch a network with 100M profiles on day one. reply",

Not quite an oxymoron but certainly a puzzlement. Maybe, generously, in retrospect, an aspiration? I never considered myself an actual engineer; I was (and still am) a self-taught un-credentialed computer programmer. More art than science. They made me take the title and the stock options and the business cards. I mostly worked for and with EEs, making software tools for test automation. I was a fanboy hardware wannabee (and still am), got some on me but was never a true engineer. I learned from those who practiced their discipline; it was plain to me the reality of real engineering versus what I was doing. I suppose in my travels I have on occasion encountered a true Software Engineer. I suppose there's reason to hope that software development will continue to mature and evolve, and eventually the other engineering disciplines will accept software as a science. For me, it will always be a joy to make that hardware work with my twiddly bits. Not engineering, no. But very rewarding work that often resembles engineering. reply",

I have looked into a couple of options such as Convex, ElectricSQL, Zero, Liveblocks, etc..<p>I feel like they always come short in a couple of ways and the best way to summarize that is their modularity.<p>What I would love in a sync engine:<p>- Being able to use my database (Postgres, AWS RDS)<p>- Being able to form and execute queries in my backend (suppose I have frontend in Next.js (Vercel) with an API route to my FastAPI server (AWS ECS) where I have all of my auth / permission middleware, etc.)<p>- Have a simple and familiar way to declare the schemas to the sync engine (like re-using SQLalchemy's or Drizzle's schemas)<p>- A simple SDK to form queries that uses SQL<p>Further, I wonder how such a system would work with connection pooling, sharding, replication etc.<p>Does something like this exist? Or what are the major challenges that prevent this from existing?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

I carried the drives around in hopes of recovering the codebase for a virtualized+distributed SSI OS (Kerrighed-module-based), which had been in the works for about a year at that point. Due to changes between 2.4/2.6 and 3.x kernel; the rise of user-level distributed computing in C/RIU, kubernetes+docker,  I never really recovered the work: there were partial backups of some of the features scattered across three contributors' systems, but no coherent backup of the unifying components; and well \"life\" with one of the key contributors becoming 'Justice Impacted' stalled any real progress.

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Today is the worst day of my life. We live in a country near Cambodia, and as you know, it is kind of a dream land for scammers. Today, it happened to my family.<p>My mother received a call from a scammer. They told her she needed to process some tax issue and prove that her bank account had enough money. In just a few minutes, they tricked her and manipulated her into entering banking OTP codes. All of her savings are now gone.<p>What makes this more dramatic is that last year I architected and helped a government department in my country build a big system. This system can track money flows across the whole country, to know where money comes from. I was very proud of this. It is the biggest achievement of my life. Even if nobody knows I built it, that was fine.<p>But now I cannot protect my own mother. I cannot protect my family. My system can track the money, but it is almost impossible to get it back.<p>When I went to the police, just in one small area, there were more than 20 cases in a single day. A hardworking student sent all their family's money, thinking it was for university fees or going abroad. An old factory worker lost all her retirement savings. So many people lost everything. That is when I realized that the system I built, the system I was proud of, is not enough.<p>All my own savings are gone too. (My mother was scammed into borrowing a lot of money and sending it to the scammers, and now it is my responsibility.) I had plans for the next few years: to do open source work, to write books about math and programming, to create a dream Go web framework, to give back to the community. Now all of that is gone.<p>But this is not only about me. I can still start over. I am strong enough to rebuild my life. But who will protect people like my mother? Or a poor student? Or a factory worker? Or so many others?<p>I can build systems. I can build distributed systems that scale to a whole country. But for what? What should I do?<p>I have been reading Hacker News for 12 to 13 years, sometimes posting from other accounts. I am writing here now to ask for advice and help from this community.<p>If anyone has experience with similar cases, or ideas on what can realistically be done, or even advice on how to move forward after something like this, I would really appreciate it. I will keep this account semi-private, because with the details above, I think some engineers from my country may recognize me.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

They can even trick a person into selling expensive property (real estate) and then steal the money. One thing is the government must act. These calls are mostly done from abroad. Phone companies can implement some protective measures. Banks too need to watch for common patterns (doesn't always help because scammers talk the victim around the checks). The society as a whole needs to get aware. What a single person could do is to keep contact with the relatives. I've read an expert report on one such case; the author wrote that even a single close someone could break the trance and stop the scam. In that case the victim happened to be a popular singer seemingly never alone, yet as it turned out she actually was a lone old lady with not a single confidant close enough for more than a month. She was, of course, shattered with what happened (she lost close to $3M), but after some time in one if her interviews she said: \"I will survive\". She said it in Russian and did not comment on the phrase further, it must be too personal. Yet of course she meant that song. The song helps her. The song's story is different, but the emotion is same. We have all our love to give. A hard hit will do good if it makes us to commit on that. reply",

Not a nice old lady after all. I haven't been following the case closely, but it seems like the decision has been overturned. Similar to Streisand Effect, there's now in Russia the term Dolina Effect [0] after this singer, referring to these \"grandma schemes\" where criminals direct the elderly to sell their property and then renege, relying on courts siding with them to keep the property and the money.

          "text": "Sorry to hear this. From where I am (India), there’s hardly anything that you can do because it’s likely that the ones with power won’t do anything. As an individual, you can only focus on yourself and those you know and try to educate them as much as is possible. These kind of scams have become a huge problem in India (look up “digital arrest” scams). People of all backgrounds and age groups have lost a lot of money (to put it in US dollar equivalent amounts, imagine a person losing few hundred thousand dollars to a couple of million dollars). There is nothing like “digital arrest” in Indian laws. The government has tried to warn people about this. The larger problem seems to be a combination of factors across disinterested entities: 1. The police aren’t interested in solving these (there’s a separate division for cybercrime). Filing a formal report is usually thwarted and avoided by the police. Even if they show some interest, it always involves paying them fat sums of money. There’s no guarantee that they can recover the money. 2. The banks aren’t interested in solving this. It seems like specific bank branch managers are involved and just stand by allowing large transactions (like cash withdrawals) to just be approved without raising any questions or concerns. All the talk by banks about “risk management” (alongside compliance matters) goes out the window just for the victims of these scams. 3. With SMS OTPs being common and the scammers recruiting some locals to run SIM farms/phone farms, the telecom companies aren’t interested in solving issues within themselves either. Though there is a limit of nine phone numbers (total) per person in India, and though there is on paper a KYC process (including a live video) to get a phone number, the telecom companies have systems and employees who can provide numerous numbers based on stolen or fake IDs. 4. The government is a bystander and appears helpless. Instead of creating laws and enforcing existing laws, it focuses on some awareness that these scams are not genuine. 5. The Supreme Court finally ordered CBI (the Indian equivalent of FBI) to investigate these scams. So there you have it: none of the entities involved has any interest or will to do something about the problem. There will always be excuses that the scammers are in another country. reply",

One urgent warning I want to share is about how scammers are now using AI. In my country, they are already using AI for video calls, voice cloning, and highly scripted conversations. The person on the screen can look and sound real. The conversation feels natural and authoritative. For many people, especially older relatives, it is almost impossible to tell that it is fake. This is no longer about obvious scam messages or bad phone calls. AI is making scams feel personal and trustworthy. Please warn your families. No bank or authority will ever ask for OTP codes or urgent transfers, even if it is a video call and the person looks real. reply",

The best thing you can do is help to educate people, maybe create an organization that can work with other organizations to target youth and senior knowledge.

One of my grandmothers was way too knowledgeable and crafty to fall for it, even pleas like, \"Grandma, I'm in jail and need help...\" absolutely failed in practice.  For better or worse, my other Grandmother had been scammed a couple times and towards the end of her life didn't have the finances to scam any more from, living with my mom and her sisters. Unfortunately the scams themselves range from amazingly complex to what should be really easy to spot.  I make it a rule to NEVER give personal information to someone that calls me unexpectedly, at least nothing that isn't already effectively public information. Annoying when your doctor's office has an automated system that calls and the first thing it does is ask for your social security number...  My response is \"nope, not doing it\" and that's what I told anyone that would listen at that office every visit... it's training people to get scammed. reply",

No legitimate organization needs full, permanent control over your bank account. If a situation feels incredibly urgent, it is almost certainly a scam. • Taxes?

They basically \"waste the scammers time\".  The scams rely on low effort ways to find the target, robocalls, emails, etc.  But once the target is found they have to put real effort into implementation.  With AI, this will only become easier on their end. I would look into solutions that would make it harder for them.  Like AI chatbots that act like targets, both text and voice.  If the majority of their efforts end up being weeks of conversation with an AI before they figure it out then it will not be worth the effort. Right now it may take them hours to find a viable target then days to extort them.  Make it take longer, until it is more lucrative to get a legitimate job. I used to think it was fun to mess with scammers... but I think these days many of them are forced into it.  Basically they are lured in with reasonable sounding job offers then once they find themselves in another country with only their \"employer\" look out for them, they basically become slave labor. You need to hurt the ones trapping the slaves that run the scams, and your weapon is the same as theirs... technology. reply",

          "text": "(If you're OP: this is not a solution per se but more of a generalist rant; just so you don't waste critical time) People talk about changing laws or technical solutions, but the inconvenient truth is that technically literate people should peer-pressure nearby friends/family/etc. into being more aware of such possibilities. I've done so, to the extent that some people find it ether borderline schizophrenic/paranoid (to my \"luck\", I live in an ex-communist country, where most people are usually skeptical in many contexts with strangers; so this group of people is relatively small). People who know better bear a responsibility towards helping others who don't; towards those who are too kind (or naive) for their own good; Even though I'm the \"tech guy\" in my close circles (family, friends,etc.) like many here, I often do the >opposite< of what other \"pro-technologists\" do these days: I don't encourage people, especially the older generation OR the more tech-illiterate ones to use more technology, because it is obvious that doing so \"injects\" another vector of attacks into their lives. More often these days this is not possible, everything gets digitalized to the detriment of such groups, but this also delves into the politics of keeping \"older options\" (cash, paper trails, etc.) available even if digitalization happens. Often times the older options are more secure, though obviously less convenient. This is a non-solution, yes, but it is the correct way to approach this (imo), as more and more places LEGALLY force digitalization of different institutions(banking, gov. agencies, etc.)  which inherently either add, or worse, completely shift the risk into virtual spaces. This is why a \"legal\" solution is more often than not either a slow one or a completely pointless one. It will always be an arms-race between scammers(which operate more effectively[in theory] due to their decentralized nature) and the gov./banks/etc., which operate in a more centralized fashion, thus demanding and imposing more control above all included parties. A legal way will always demand more than it's worth. I digress from my shift into politics, but bottom line is this: don't let your peers/family/closed ones get into these situations. If you have \"an authoritative\" voice regarding tech, use it to first cultivate awareness regarding dangers, before cultivating hype/or anything else. (Obviously not talking about anyone specifically, but the whole \"geeksphere\" as a whole) Good luck to you and your family. reply",

How valid would this be given that prompts are, essentially language? How detailed does a prompt need to be to be complex intellectual property that describes a process? Can we consider it as code and an embodiment of a concept?<p>Discuss. And Happy Holidays!</p></p></div>",

          "text": "Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer.  I am not your lawyer.  This is not legal advice. In the United States, the only patentable subject matter is processes, machines, manufactures, or compositions of matter [1].  Anything outside of those areas is not directly patentable.  Some subject matter like mathematics and \"mental processes\" generally are categorized as \"abstract ideas\" that therefore are not directly patentable [2].  It is possible to patent something that contains an abstract idea, but it also has to have some \"additional elements\" that elevate it beyond merely claiming an abstract idea. I suggest reading  MPEP § 2106 [2] and looking at the first diagram given there titled \"Subject Matter Eligibility Test for Products and Processes\".  That is the exact analysis that a patent examiner would use to determine if something is patentable subject matter or not (including for any claim with a prompt). I strongly suggest that you talk to a lawyer if you want specific advice that answers your question directly.  I'm not commenting on any copyright aspects.

Anyone who attempts to do so will either need to be  secretive and bribey to pull it off and will then also have to hope that no one ever finds out because if they did, then in any legal proceedings that come due to said patent, (which is the entire point of a patent), the outcome will be that their patent is invalidated by the court and the case thrown out. The point of a patent is to make it so that, while the patent lasts, no one else can use said patent without licensing it from you, and if they do so without the license they open themselves up to civil penalties that can exceed any potential profits from the illicit licensing. 1: Prompts have no value in and of themselves. 2: The ownership of raw AI generated materials is in a grey area. It might be public domain, it might be owned by the person who prompted it, we don't have clear hard guidelines on that. 3: AI is trained on a dataset of billions of pieces of other peoples work. Any novelty (novelty is a requirement for a patent) that comes from AI is at best an accident of the same variety as the colors produced by spilling paint, where it has taken a slice from one person and a slice from another person and mixed them together. So, all in all, AI prompts and their output are almost certainly not patentable, at least as long as one sane person is in the pipeline somewhere. reply",

(I slightly balked at the $5 initial price, but then realized: this is a desperation fee and I think for a lot of the users a clear fee for a clear one off service is the best deal.

I’m just going to bullet some of them out in no particular order: - We do the work to find the restaurant and curate a menu, story, and theme. E.g., we might go to an Indian restaurant and focus the event on only the southern regional dishes. - Many times we have dishes that are off menu specially for our event. - Sense of community. We have quite a few regulars who have gotten to know each other. In 2025, 45 people reached their 20th or 30th event with us. Since we take over the whole restaurant there’s a little more freedom in how the space is used. Lots of new friendships have been forged. - When you go to a restaurant with a friend or small group, you can only order so much. We’ve had events with upwards of 25 different bites. There’s really no better way to sample everything the restaurant has to offer. - There’s a few people who say their partner are picky eaters, so they come to our event each month to have the opportunity to be a bit more adventurous. It’s an incredibly diverse group with a lot of different reasons to attend. reply",

          "text": "My partner and I divide and conquer. He focuses on front of house and I handle the backoffice. The process starts ~3 months before the event. We start by picking a theme or region. Then contact some restaurants that fit the criteria and pitch them the event. That kicks off the back and forth on cost and menu. Around 4 weeks before the event we send a save the date + previous event recap email. We summarize the last event and tease the next event, without giving away the actual resturant or type of food. Over the next week we prep the invite email and payment forms. This requires putting the dishes on our menu template, research and writing about the history of the dishes, the region, and the resturant. Some of this content also goes onto our website. Three weeks out we send the invite, which is a lottery system. Members have 5 days to request a seat and place a credit card hold. 5 days later we run the lottery (I wrote some basic software to randomize assignment, conver the card auth to capture and release any cards that didn't get assigned a ticket). Then we send an email to everyone who got in with which night they recieved and another email to anyone who was waitlisted. Everyone is added to a spreadsheet to track. 1 week before the event we send a reminder email and a last chance to cancel before the ticket is non refundable. At the event we play host and check each guest in and say hi to everyone. Then we give a prepared ~5 min intro about the food, restaurant, celebrate any milestone members, and make any general house keeping accounments. Our 20 club members get a branded apron. At the event we take video and pictures. Over the course of the next 4 weeks we post dish pictures with descriptions and history of the dish on our instagram. We also make a 1-2 min recap video of the event which also goes on our instagram and website. Separate from the actual event related work we have to manage the books, handle members emails, and review membership requests. More recently we started selling shirts, so there's a little work in managing that as well. reply",

We also have an unbelievably respectful and mature community. After over 70 seatings we’ve never had an incident. We also have a code of conduct document we send all new members. Second, we setup an LLC to shield us personally from legal liability. Third, not to say that it shields us, but the restaurants also have insurance and are a better target for a lawsuit.

We don't make money from customers as we don't have a finalized product yet. But we have an ongoing grant from the NLnet[2].\nYou can have a look at the kind of projects they are granting money. It's always a source of inspiration. That being said IronCalc takes a lot of time from me. Way more than a side project should.

The compute would differ, but loading speed shouldn't be an issue if you can render the HTML first, and hydrate it after page load. This static HTML would then also serve as fallback when Javascript is disabled. - For a quick demo, I doubt you will lose people by embedding an older version. Serving a version of a few months ago seems like 80% of the work, with 20% of the effort, in terms of deployment. Anyhow, nice to see government funds put to a good cause! reply",

So you take existing recordings created before 1929 and remaster them? Are recordings (of books published pre-1929) which were created after 1929 in public domain too? I don't even want to ask about producing and voice actors.. Really nice idea and realization! reply",

          "text": "There's a really awesome site called Librivox [1], where volunteers narrate books that are in the public domain. Those recordings are also in the public domain as well (this is just part of the Librivox thing). The quality of those recordings (both the narration, and the actual recording quality) varies quite a bit and most of them aren't at a quality I'd expect people to pay for and thus aren't useable for me. I've spent hours and hours sorting through those recordings finding the best ones (from a narration perspective) and then improving the recording/audio quality on them. Those recordings have all mostly been made in the last 20yrs, so they're not old recordings of the books. So, the value I add to the Librivox recordings are: curation/selection, audio enhancement, and a much better delivery mechanism (IMHO). I'm also simultaneously building out our own library of original audio content by working with voice actors to get them recorded and proof read (this is a very expensive and time consuming process, but also very fun). One of the hardest parts is honestly the proofing process. Once I get finished narration files I have to compare them result with the actual script (as there are always mistakes) and request edits. I use whisper.cpp to transcribe them and then git and a few other scripts to compare the transcript with the actual book text. I'll also add that I _do not_ use AI Audio narration because it just doesn't sound good IMHO, and I personally hate listening to it. I regularly run experiments to see what the current state of the tech is and it's still pretty far from where it needs to be IMO. I also don't love the idea of AI swallowing absolutely everything. I appreciate the feedback and compliment! [1] https://librivox.org/ reply",

          "text": "Here’s my own side project that’s been earning a bit on the side: I built DedupX, a macOS app for finding duplicate and visually similar files fast - especially useful for photographers and anyone with big local storage collections. What it does - Exact duplicate detection using incremental hashing so it doesn’t have to fully load huge files. - Perceptual image matching finds similar images even if they’re resized or lightly edited (not just byte-for-byte duplicates). - Native macOS integration with a Finder right-click scan. Why I built it: My brother kept running out of space because of tons of photos, and every existing tool I tried either missed similar images or was slow and clunky - so I spent a couple of weekends building something that felt fast, accurate, and native. Business side - Free trial (no CC required). - Paid tiers: ~$5.99/yr or ~$16.99 lifetime. Got positive feedback and 100+ paying users shortly after launch. Been growing steadily ever since.

I don't want any of these to happen, but unfortunately I think they might: - US starts a digital services trade war with the EU. It starts out with tariffs on digital services provided to the USA. EU responds in kind. Google Cloud, AWS and Azure lose a lot of clients over this, but they mitigate the damage by restructuring their business to avoid the tariffs. The tariffs don't achieve any policy change in the EU and eventually settle on a tolerable level. - Significantly more restrictions and tightening on the US Visa Waiver Programme, with a small chance that it is rescinded altogether. VWP beneficiary countries threaten to retaliate in kind, but never do, because US tourism is too valuable. - China continues to overtake the USA in growth in tech and digital services related exports. FVEY gets very nervous about this, but in practice nothing is done because of strong consumer demand. - Coreweave faces solvency issues and numerous AI companies fundraising are forced to do their next raise at a down round. - AI job loss is revealed to not actually be real. The cause of unemployment really is finally realized to be economic uncertainty caused by high inflation, interest rates and international trade policy uncertainty. Potential digital services tariffs and AI boom collapse make the situation much worse. - Significantly more momentum behind the HIRE Act, with a small chance that it passes. If it does, tech giants close their EU/UK/Canada/Australia offices and move the roles to India. - Russia / Ukraine \"peace deal\" is signed, but will be broken by Russia based on some false flag. Russia's invasion and occupation of Ukraine unfortunately continues, but doesn't progress. - MAGA aligned actors interfere in the election of another country. - USA conducts a \"special operation\" in Venezuela. - Weaponized AI generated disinformation and fake audio/video/images starts to become more common. A major news story will break based on AI generated disinformation. It will be disproven quickly, but not before it has had a chance to spread. reply",

AI (especially LLMs) will likely stay top-of-mind in 2026, but I expect costs to drop meaningfully and capabilities to feel more “infrastructure-like” rather than magical. SME Adoption will drive the AI to masses. If AI doesn’t meet near-term revenue and productivity promises, we may see pressure or stagnation in tech valuations, even as the underlying technology continues to improve. In other words, the market may cool before the tech does. On the macro side, I wouldn’t be surprised if we see more market stability or mild declines, driven by a re-rating of expectations rather than a systemic collapse. Capital might rotate from speculative growth into cash-flow-positive businesses that actually deploy AI profitably. More broadly, I think 2026 will reward:\nreliability over flashy innovation in AI , Engineering depth over marketing narratives, Systems thinking over isolated “features” Less “what’s possible?” and more “what actually works at scale?” reply",

The opportunities to have a successful career as a salaried employee decline significantly - people are pushed to start small businesses out of necessity - and this barrier is lower due to AI.

I asked why: they say it is funny, entertaining and if there has been no humans involved, they don't care as it is entertaining and fun: they rather have more different than more original/human. I saw my neighbour here watching shorts about fat americans abusing all you can eat restaurants, generated by AI, for 7 days in a row now, whenever he is awake. He is 45 years old and wants to show me the funniest ones. reply",

          "text": "This is less of a prediction, more of how I see this industry progressing. I really feel \"web dev\" is going to get highly commoditized by GenAI, by web dev I mean 99% of building CRUD-adjacent apps, we are already seeing it now with tools like Claude Code etc, this pipeline is just going to get more refined, with tigther testing feedback loops, PR-workflows and a CI/CD deployment pipeline which the GenAI will control. This might be amplified by the fact the sheer amount of tested, high quality there is in the JavaScript-ecosystem for the AI to train on and learn from. Software engineering in general will tend more systems and embedded software, fields where GenAI can't perform well or can't be trusted to produce good code (I am thinking writing device drivers, or maintainence of legacy C applications) as well as deep research fields. The average software engineering job might be either that of a \"technical product manager\", or \"researcher\" or \"low-level systems expert\" That's just what I feel. Honestly, I am probably much younger an others on this forum, so I haven't really seen this industry \"evolve\" this is just how it looks to me now. I believe there was a time in the early 2010s where there was a boom of this \"generalist developer\" where if you knew your JavaScript-ecosystem (or App Dev ecosystem for that matter) pretty well, you could land a pretty decent job right out of college, or without a college degree at all. To me, at this stage the world in general needs software engineers who understand the \"world\" if that makes sense (in terms of physics, mathematics), or who have a really good mental model of computation. Better put, software engineering will become a tool in the larger context of research & development of tech that advance humanity. reply",

I mean, we have SRE, which is a whole set of skillsets in itself and it does involve around maintaining \"CRUD-apps\"; Heck there is the cybersec industry as well, ensuring CRUD-apps aren't exploited. My para was certainly a bit more 2D, I was speaking more from what I might benefit learning now, to get a job, say end of 2026. I have observed many roles like SRE etc, require certain experience which is hard to get by working on your own projects without much traction; similiar case for cybersec but to a lesser extent.

Yes that's true but I would argue this isn't because of AI itself. Sure it might have accelerated it but I have heard that in the 2020's a lot of people got a lot of jobs in the industry and then its that the market did feel saturated and in a sense, a lot of jobs feel this way in the economy where if someone has it, they continue having it but its becoming harder for new people to enter, there are financials reasons for this too mostly if i remember, interests rates are one of the core reasons That being said, Even though I have used LLM's a lot, I do not agree with your opinion and I am even younger than you most likely (17) A lot of people my age/people just going into college would use AI a lot to cheat but I will genuinely try to take it slow to learn things. I will try to use it as a learning tool and not as a crutch. Currently I am still in high school and I get ideas which I wish to implement but dont have the time because of exams so I test them out with LLM's but even I find the whole process frustrating at times and its just, maybe its me but there is a good ceiling that I can process. Some basic crud processes can definitely be in that but if your project is novel, even basic things can be hard I will give you an example, I recently tried creating an api for proton docs which worked by having browser instances. I had two basic scripts that worked on one platform and converted them to puppeteer using LLM and after it worked, I then asked it to simply create a very basic crud api on top of it Nope, I tried it 5-6 times on the best models on the market but they couldn't actively take two files which had read/write and have it work, either there was an issue in read or an issue in write I am fine with the project as it is right now and I am fine with the templates it has given me and I am going to build it now on top of it I had many ideas which could be considered basic crud apps like having a kanban app/github issues like ui on top of bitwarden after I saw a post here by simon saying how he uses github issues and that went semi-viral on hackernews Another issue is that I think just as how sure writers and similar can generate AI generated, I feel like there would be more trust on the non AI generated code. Personally I will try my best to create prototypes with AI and if I like them, I will see what it does and then rewrite them myself as an learning experience and also because people say spec driven development etc. but I just want to code things by hand at this point or convert the LLM generated prototypes of idea to something that I later code and understand by hand tbh (most likely when I get into college) reply",

          "text": "I wrote a lot. Let me add a tldr: any international trades happening in non-US dollar is an \"acceleration\" of dedollarizatiom, given that currently all trade is dollarized. Original: I don't known if I understand the spirit of the question. There are no metrics or tracking of how \"dollarized\" the international economy is because virtually all trade is done in dollars and there has been no risk of this changing for the past ?65? years My original prediction for 2026 ( not 2025, mind you) made in 2024 was based on a few factors, if I recall correctly, 1) the Russia-Ucraine war and related sanctions; 2) the open discussion in BRICS about trade in direct currencies; and 3) the then-promised isolatonist policies of Trump's second mandate. What we've seen in 2025 makes all of those stronger I guess. 1) I don't know the status of the Russia-Ucraine war; all I know is it is a glaring sign of the end of Pax Americana (as is the Israel-Palestine genocide/war, by the way, which the US would -not- have allowed given the strong internal opposition and negative popularity among the American public). So sanctions of Russia notwistanding, that status quo, which strongly related to dollar as reserve currency, is either agonizing or dead. 2) Trump and the US attempted a very strong response to the (first ever?) trades in local currency between Brazil and China, mostly in the form of targeted tariffs (all discourse about Bolsonaro and whatever being the motivation for tariffing Brazilian imports being, in my opinion, political smoke and mirrors). I don't think it worked. I think BRICS might press on this. If the mercosur/EU trade deal goes through it will also be a strong force towards trade in Euros/Reais/Pesos directly I believe. 3) I don't think I need to clarify; tariffs and other issues brought on by the current US government were severely negative to the placement of the US as a preferred trade partner. This is to beyond economic choice; active anti-american sentiment are at all times high in countries like Canada, Denmark, and Mexico, all historically aligned with the US. This may not seem that relevant but come election cycles in those and other countries we might see platforms/candidates that openly propose to \"secede\" from the US hegemony international order. If that happens, removing US military bases is a first go. Alternatives to the US \"petrodollar\" a close second. reply",

I feel like a lot of companies will see even more losses/ its not that good overall As I have said within the 2020's the interest rate was down so people hired more and there was already a hiring freeze of sorts when interest rates were raised I feel like 4-5 years down the line, interest rates can go down again and with all the other AI things seeping into reality/market corrections overall, I feel like there can be cases where using AI can panic the market and lose stock prices and so with all the other factors, I feel like employment will go up again To be honest, I dont know too much about employment, I feel like its similar to mathematics in a sense but I read books on finance and so my honest opinion is that the goal of being financially independent is to do the work that you like and I genuinely enjoy doing this work for the most part and so no matter how much it pays (which I assume to be honest would be good enough for me considering I live in third world country and I am frugal anyways) plus with all the other factors, i am pretty optimistic. I am also optimistic that I can create my own businesses much rather easily by prototyping multiple ideas with LLM generated code and then locking in on those which have a market fit to gain a sustainable cash cow. I will do these things when I get into university and then 4 years down the line, I do think that I can find something which can hopefully click but I still might do a job. In my opinion, the companies not hiring right now are gonna cause an higher issue down the line and I am confident that no matter what, I just wanna do the thing I like as a job and there are other opinions on this matter (see other comment) which are optimistic down 4-5 years and I share that opinion reply",

The core issue is structural: most cryptocurrencies depend on foundations that fund development, marketing, and operations through large token holdings. When prices fall, these entities eventually become forced sellers. At some point, their “whale power” is not optional but necessary to survive, creating persistent sell pressure and undermining long-term trust. Bitcoin likely has a longer lifespan than most alternatives due to its lack of a foundation, fixed monetary policy, and social inertia. Over time, it may absorb whatever residual trust exists in the broader crypto space. However, that does not imply indefinite relevance: Bitcoin could survive while gradually becoming economically marginal, not dead, but increasingly negligible outside niche use cases. reply",

          "text": "I imagine my answer will be a bit unique - I'm in tech because I like computers and I'm good at working with them, but I feel a strong conviction that if I'd had my way, I would've gone into some sort of sex work, likely either porn or pro-domme work. There was an article posted here[0] a few years ago by an escort reflecting on her experiences, and the conclusion, which spoke to the human element of the work, deeply resonated with me - in fact, I recently left the IC track for a manager role because I'm realizing how meaningful I find work that exercises empathy to be. Human sexuality is the one thing in this world that's more interesting to me than computers, and while I'm grateful for my stable job and career that allow me to explore it as a hobby, I'm infinitely curious about what that other life would have looked like.

If that's something that matters to you, and it sounds like it is, I definitely recommend pushing for that.

After that two weeks I even did some market research to see if there was any way to make a remotely comparable living off of it (unfortunately there wasn't, at least until the kids are out of the house and expenses go way down).  I also realized that my style was not well aligned with popular styles at the time (this was 2019), and that shipping costs basically meant I could only sell to local area (and even then delivery cost/time would require adding too much margin).

It's typically not recommended to self-design, the physics gets technical and there are a lot of free working plans out there including by famous naval architects. Most people start out with simpler designs using plywood and fiberglass but, due to my aforementioned disdain for a lot of modern approaches, I personally went with a traditional oak frame, cedar plank, copper rivet construction. It is very time consuming but I'm enjoying the journey. I chose a flat-bottomed sail boat design (dory) to make it a little easier on myself. There are endless variations on the concept of a \"wooden vessel that can be propelled through water\" idea so it really depends on your interests and tastes. It's a \"form follows function\" situation too, so you also need to consider your use case -- engine, oar, sail; ocean, river, lake; etc. reply",

But my initial plans after high school fell through and I found myself needing to make a living. Naturally I reached for a software career, but I do hate it as much as I expected. I didn’t really have anything else going for me skill wise. The idea of spending four more years in school didn’t appeal to me as a teenager (though I regret this greatly). I didn’t attend a community college for a few months, but dropped out as it felt like a waste of time and money. So realistically, I’d probably have been stuck working unskilled near-minimum wage jobs I had been working before I started my career. Prior to that, I had a fascination with biology that competed with computer briefly. “Bioinformatics” was a word that came up often in career ideas while I was in high school, but that was such a small niche, I really had no concept at all as to what that career path would have looked like. Nowadays, there’s many more things I’m interested in, but they’re all inaccessible as careers at this point. Over the years, I’ve been inspired by things like RF engineering, physics, PLC programming, and even various natural sciences, but lacked the education/intelligence/cash to go back to school. Certainly for as long as I’d have to for those careers. AI will likely reduce the number of people needed in the sort of fields anyway. reply",

You really need some passionate \"boots on the ground\" for it to work, you can't just send money over and have it work out most of the time. Finding the people who could run it well, and convincing them to do it is the hard part. These types of people are usually also not the best when \"bad\" people come around to bend the purpose to their desires. It is my dream to do some of it in the developing world too, if I were to visit someplace often to help out more. A church I used to attend was big on surfing and would take trips to a small town in Mexico. They build an orphanage, some living spaces for single mothers, drastically improved some schools amongst other things and I think that was an awesome way to do charity. There were a couple run-ins with smalltime cartel-ish activity (as they saw it as a power grab) but because everything was from church to church, most donations came in the form of infrastructure and supplies (no money to take), and the pastor was a bit crazy (he visits prisons often and can deal with the thug mindset) they allowed it continue. reply",

Was thinking about making bespoke musical instruments based on some of these learnings. Of particular interest was some interesting types of feedback that came from the Tesla coils. Basically we modulated the frequency we drove the coils to produce sound, but the coils would interfere with one another because that’s how electromagnetism works. We had to tune them to different resonant frequencies to play sound. But the interference itself could sound unique and eerie, sometimes like an old-timey radio. It’s similar in principle to a theremin but a very different sound. Or I could just get a soul sucking job and do this in early retirement. Shrug. reply",

Or to put it another way, the thing you do is to solve the actual problems other people have. That's what you need to sell. You aren't selling the fact that you know how to use a hammer. You are selling the idea that you can build the right hammer for the job. So sales is not \"out reach.\" It is \"what do you need?\" and you will probably do better by optimizing for getting to that conversation, not through optimizing for low effort on your part. Linked-in is best used for networking not push notification. Networking is about trust. Maybe you can't help with someone's problem but you know someone who can. Finally, you can't sell desperately.

I’ve never met anyone who can clearly explain how it works in practice. Not just the rules, but the dynamics: what’s repeatable, what’s luck, and what actually matters.<p>By using the Kevin Bacon-number idea: I can usually get within three degrees of separation of well-known technologists like Linus Torvalds, but I can’t seem to get within three steps of someone who confidently understands how HN works.<p>So I’m asking sincerely:\nDoes anyone here feel they understand Hacker News?\nIf so, what are the real levers, and what do people consistently misunderstand?<p>PS: This question comes from a mix of genuine curiosity and personal frustration. I’m honestly trying to understand how HN works in practice.</p></p></p></p></div>",

I've made friends here, have been helped by people on projects that I was busy with, did the reverse, found friends and business partners and spend way too much time. HN is a very interesting slice of the online world, a place that is unlike the rest, sometimes a bit dry but always interesting and extremely useful. If you're looking at it to try to understand it then you might as well try to understand a rat or a mouse. You won't understand it because it isn't there to be understood, it just is, like any other organism. The root of HN is a thing called 'startup news', that was changed very quickly and since then HN has been a focal point for techies of all sorts but also lots of other people from all walks of life and from a large variety of countries. It isn't 'one thing' to everybody that participates, just like a hammer is a different thing for a carpenter than it is for a masoner or a farmer. The fact that after being a member for a couple of years you have this question indicates a lack of participation, not a lack of understanding. reply",

          "text": "> Hacker news is there to promote ycombinator companies I should probably clarify this a bit. It's true that HN sponsors Launch HNs (and Show HNs) by YC startups. This is in the FAQ: https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html . However, YC would not be funding HN if that were the only reason for it. It's a secondary factor. Far more important than promoting existing startups is attracting founders who might start new startups. This requires an entirely different strategy than promotion: it requires being interesting enough to attract the right kind of users. That's why the site is organized around curiosity, as I explained elsewhere in the current thread ( https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46309399 ). For more on this, here are past explanations: optimizing for curiosity - https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&sor... relationship between HN and YC's business interests - https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=false&so... reply",

That's because giving “extra help” to YC-funded startups is far less valuable (to everyone including the startup themselves [1]) than just making HN interesting to readers and showcasing cool projects, no matter who has built them. [1] More than almost anything else, what I've learned from moderating HN is that “extra help” to get onto the front page of HN is of barely any help at all. That is, if the post isn't interesting enough to earn significant numbers of upvotes and good comments very quickly, it will disappear off the front page very quickly.

I've also seen people associated with YC backed companies here downvoted into the toilet for spouting unpopular opinions. The only thing that possibly could happen (and that would be fairly hard to detect) is brigading on a company level, but I would accuse the likes of Google and Apple of that long before I would do so with the YC mods. Think about the opportunity cost of moderating this site. If you take that into account and then combine what you know of Dan and Tom with them selling out their integrity for a pittance if it would come to light that they did so it would wreck their reputation, which is pretty much the only compensation they really get here.

I've always been a fan of analyzing all of the flags retro-actively to see if they were just or not and to have a per-subject matrix that would weigh flags from particular users. So anybody that is on the gravy train at apple would find their apple flagging permissions removed, and all YC combinator founders would have their ability to flag YC related threads removed.

          "text": "Not everything has to have an explicit purpose beyond “this is a good and valuable thing”. Why do I take in parcels for my neighbour if a courier knocks on my door? She doesn’t pay me. It wouldn’t cause me any harm if I didn’t. But it makes the place nicer to live, and I’ve become friends with her as a result. She invited me to dinner recently and fed me delicious food, and we drank very good champagne. That was an unexpected bonus. “To promote ycombinator” only works if there’s an audience worth promoting to. Building something great that brings people back day after day maybe has the result that it can also serve as a promotional tool - but that’s a bonus, not necessarily a purpose. I’m not the person you asked the question of - but I think the purpose of ycombinator is to give relevant people a place to discuss things aligned with the ecosystem in which ycombinator operates, to help strengthen and champion that ecosystem. Does it have a payoff for ycombinator? Almost certainly. Was it created with that explicit purpose in mind? I doubt it. There are easier ways to make money. reply",

Initially it was supposed to be a side project—an application to sharpen Arc on, and a place for current and future Y Combinator founders to exchange news._ _ Hacker News is an experiment, and an experiment in a very young field. Sites of this type are only a few years old. Internet conversation generally is only a few decades old. So we've probably only discovered a fraction of what we eventually will._ _ Hacker News is definitely useful. I've learned a lot from things I've read on HN. I've written several essays that began as comments there. So I wouldn't want the site to go away. But I would like to be sure it's not a net drag on productivity. What a disaster that would be, to attract thousands of smart people to a site that caused them to waste lots of time._ reply",

The reason why HN is so much better than other fora (IMO) is that the mods don't allow lever-pulling and astroturfing to overtake regular contributions.

But the fact that mostly nobody cares about karma means that you can post something and have it be evaluated on its technical, economic, social merits.

          "text": "I can't know for sure. For me, it's just the \"eyeball method\" of comparing HN and different subreddits on Reddit. As to how I (or anyone) could show this, here are a few example questions: 1. How many examples of stealthy but otherwise blatant promotion do you see in the comments? Not every astroturfing campaign will be successful or original, so you'd be able to notice some patterns. Plus, HN is already commercially oriented, and there's the \"Show HN\" option, so it reduces the incentives for astroturfing. 2. Alternatively, how much controversy is there around the specific type of forum? For some subreddits, for example, you'd be able to see counter-subreddits popping up when participants feel the mods are abusing their power to promote one type of opinion. 3. Is a certain type of political/brand-related opinion or interpretation always at the top of your comment feed? For example, if upvotes determine the order of the comments, do you consistently see fewer critical comments on things that you'd expect the community to react to in different ways. 4. Do you consistently see some contributors having more power in discussions over others? Other than the mods, obviously. If this is the case, karma (i.e., number of upvotes) often has more value. Still, I could be wrong. reply",

          "text": "(I'm a mod here) It's true that this place can be cryptic, and that has downsides—specifically, it can be confusing to newcomers, even to some newcomers who would make ideal HN users. That sucks. But there's a key that unlocks most of the puzzles. That is to understand that we're optimizing for exactly one thing: curiosity. (Specifically, intellectual curiosity, since there are other kinds of curiosity too.) Here are links to past explanations about that: https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&sor... We try to elevate things that gratify curiosity: creative work, surprising discoveries, deep dives, technical achievements, unusual personal experience, whimsical unpredictability, good conversation, etc. And we try to demote things that run against curiosity, especially repetition, indignation, sensationalism, and promotion. It gets complicated because you'll also see plenty of repetition, indignation, sensationalism, and promotion on HN—alas! This is the internet after all. But the site survives because the balance of these things stays within tolerable ranges, thanks to two factors: an active community which cares greatly about preserving this place for intended purpose ( https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html ); and an owner (Y Combinator) that pays us to work on the site full time and mainly just wants us to keep it good, to the extent possible. If you really want to figure this place out, the way to do it is as a reader . Hang out on the site, look at the mix of articles that make the frontpage, spend time in the discussion threads (hopefully the interesting sectors and not the flamey ones!), and over time your eyes will adjust. What doesn't work—and this is good because we want it not to work—is approaching HN as a platform for promoting content. If you (<-- I don't mean you personally, but anyone) mainly care about \"how can I use this thing to get attention for my startup/blog/project/newsletter\", then you're operating in 'push' mode rather than 'pull' mode (or 'idle' mode, which is even better). In that case you won't be curious because you're too focused on what you're wanting for extraneous reasons—and if you aren't in a state of curiosity, this place won't make sense. At least we hope it won't! reply",

Honestly hackernews to me is a place where tinkering as a hobby is appreciated. I have read so many large threads here and ended up sometimes having a new point of view on something and so many posts here which make me want to be curious and tinker around too. I cannot really name something exactly which clicks on hackernews but that is what makes it unique and this does mean I cannot explain it to others sometimes since my hobbies are tangential to hackernews too, I just end up saying my hobby is tinkering with computers (currently only software) reply",

However, I feel like there's a lot more repetition, indignation, sensationalism, and promotion on HN in the last few months than there has ever been. I feel like every other thread on here devolves into an unhinged rant about AI, enshittification, privacy, or crazy conspiracy theories about age restrictions on social media and the politicians passing them (which I'm personally a staunch opponent of). It's all the same arguments over and over, most of them without a shred of evidence. It feels like people aren't arguing in good faith any more, we're all just screaming our politics at (or past) each other. This didn't use to be the case. (yes I know I have showdead on, those are not the dead comments). reply",

          "text": "I’ve been posting here for a  decade, and lurking for a few years before that, and your observation tracks with my experience. There’s a handful of ideas we’re collectively mulling over at any given time. They slowly rotate in and out, and modulate into different keys as they go. For instance, the leading edge of LLM related discourse seems to be improving now that we’re getting bored with both hype and outrage, although there’s still plenty of hype and outrage. Old topics still occasionally blip into focus, but they don’t have the same staying power. Like, you’ll see a Rails post every now and then, but it’s not the darling it was. I doubt we’ll ever see the likes of “Rails is a Ghetto” make the rounds again, because nobody’s worked up about it any more. Or take Skrillex, who must have been on the front page every week for a month. I was annoyed at the time, but I think we’re due for a retrospective on programmers and dubstep. I’m not the one to write it though; not my scene in the first place. Anyway, thank you dang for your moderation! reply",

I have one personal email that has a custom domain. 1 that's a plain gmail address and then a variety of random accounts I can't even remember but I guess were legacy or tests for new providers like protonmail. Then there's email address for whatever company you work for at the time. I realise I don't really want to hand out my personal email in a public setting and my company address is mostly for internal stuff. So where's public email?<p>Are we missing public email accounts? One's that you can just hand out anywhere?</p></div>",

You'll probably have to go to a bunch of conferences, talk to people, and make contacts, and hope you can discover a place where your unique skills are a greater value to somebody's project than anyone with expertise in only one of those fields could be. reply",

          "text": "I did move from physics to becoming a SWE. I could put the knowledge I gained doing 3D rendering and GPU compute used for visualization and simulations in my academic jobs on my CV, and get a job as a SWE that way. Later I moved to another job where I could use my physics background to help develop a new sensor. As for how to market yourself: first you should convert your academic CV to one that is suited for the type of companies you are applying for. Unless you wrote something that ended up in Nature or some other super high profile journal, companies typically don't care about your publications. What they do care about is things like: can you communicate well? How well can you organize things on your own? Do you handle stress well? You did a PhD, so the answer to those things is yes, you just need to write that in your CV in a way a company recruiter/interviewer understands, even if they themselves are not from academia. So you don't have two halves that belong to different resumes, you are just one person and you just translate your resume to the \"language\" that your prospective job provider speaks. Finally, your list of skills does not need to be a perfect match for what a company is looking for. Of course, there needs to be some overlap, but as long as it means you can pick up new things quickly, it will be fine. That and being a good fit for the company's culture are the most important things. I did not start out with a unicorn role, but in I found ways to apply my physics background in my current job. reply",

These roles exist, but probably not commonly as a straight hybrid - may have to lean into one and use the other as a differentiator/value-add. For me, I think I got here by caring about the customer experience first - which takes \"whatever it takes\" - software and science both. I have to be an evangelist for both of these things but only as a means to a common end, which is to help the end users expand their understanding and abilities with applied knowledge. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">My daughter followed the playbook everyone here recommends. MIT. Programming olympiads. Strong internships. No shortcuts.<p>She was hired as a junior developer and laid off in February.<p>Since then, I’ve watched her confidence collapse in real time. She isolates herself. She barely talks. She spends most days in her room applying, waiting, and getting silence. I recently saw her crying alone, trying not to be noticed. That’s when it hit me how deeply this has affected her.<p>This layoff didn’t just remove a paycheck. It removed her belief that effort correlates with outcomes. Every rejection reinforces the idea that none of what she did mattered.<p>It’s Christmas and we aren’t celebrating. No decorations. No pretending things are okay. I’m completely shattered as a parent, mostly because I don’t have answers. I told her for years that merit would protect her. It didn’t.<p>So I’m asking this community directly.\nIs this just timing and bad luck, or is the ladder actually broken for juniors right now. How long does this phase last in reality, not theory. And what actually helps someone recover emotionally when their first real job ends like this.<p>I’d appreciate honest answers, not platitudes.</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

I am similar to your daughter in some ways but much older. Lately, I have felt that I have reached a dead-end in my career (though I am still employed). I have a few thoughts that might be useful. One is the concept of ikigai: finding the intersection of what you enjoy, what you are good at, and what the world needs. For a long time, it seemed like building software hit all three marks for me, but in the last couple of years, it no longer seems to hit the last one very well. When I was younger, my reaction to difficult things was to simply try harder. I’d throw myself at the problem repeatedly until it yielded. That can be the right thing to do, but with age I have gained enough wisdom to realize that sometimes it’s better to go after the lower-hanging fruit. I am not suggesting that your daughter give up, but if I were you, I would help her identify a back-up plan. Help her get excited about the possibilities in case plan A does not work out. If she feels that she has other options, she may regain her confidence regardless of what happens. reply",

I think the tech labor market bottom is in the past, venture capital is flowing again, companies that over hired have corrected it, interest rates are on their way back down, and a bunch of huge IPOs are lining up for 2026 - Stripe, OpenAI, Anthropic, SpaceX, Databricks, Canva, Discord - which is going to inject a bunch of liquidity into tech capital markets. And the jury is still out on AI, very much at the top of a hype cycle, CEOs and boards have prematurely declared to their customers and the world that AI is working (because saying that makes their stock price go up) but the enterprise outcomes don't seem to be there. My advice to your daughter: to try to make software into a fun hobby, watch a ton of coding youtube, AI and youtube are tearing down hurdles to learning, make a twitter, talk about your hobby, farm those likes. What were her favorite courses at MIT? it's true that software is increasingly competitive and yet the barriers to becoming competitive are ever lower (FOR those in a supportive environment who can make space to take advantage) reply",

But that’s all it does and everything you’ve said is applicable from that point on. Put in other words, merit can help you get a job at Google, McKinsey, Jane Street, CERN or what have you - but your success after that significantly dependends on your innate survival skills and some luck. The latter is indiscernible and very hard to quantify but it’s what we say is being in the right place at the right time (or the opposite of it). All that to say that in OPs case that his daughter hasn’t done anything wrong. He hasn’t done anything wrong. Times are changing and during the transition phase with the adoption of AI (and current geopolitical climate), companies are weary of making any significant investments and realigning their cost structures towards resilience. Except for certain pockets, there’s less spending on R&D, non-cash cow BUs being folded down, etc. IMO, OP should suggest and encourage therapy or some kind of a professional with a “coaching” angle  (life coach, career coach, emotional coach, …) to support her and keep her motivated through this - like any professional athlete after a major setback.

This is pretty bonkers on multiple levels. IDK what your family's overall situation is, but based on what we can infer, your family is not in economic jeopardy. If I'm mistaken, then I apologize, but it seems you are just one of the many, many families with an unemployed recent college grad, and if you're positing on HN, I assume you and your wife are doing at least adequately. I don't understand how you, as a grown man, could be under the illusion that \"merit would protect her\" or that somehow graduating from a good school guarantees someone anything, or how you could lack the perspective that this is temporary and less important than health, family, etc. Nobody is above broader, universal developments and forces, whether economic vicissitudes or worse (war, societal collapse, etc.) Your arrogance in thinking that \"merit\" could protect an individual from these things is justly punished. I also went to a top school, and there is also something to be said about your daughter's lack of resilience and naiveté here, but she's a ~22 year old girl, so that's acceptable. From you, this is not, IMO. Your entire view of the world was mistaken and brittle, and reveals a stunning lack of value placed on things other than career and such, but the good news is that it's much better than you seem to be stuck thinking right now. Economies get good again, and your daughter is in a better position than many because she at least had one job and has a good CV. reply",

          "text": "Muslim majority country here (Malaysia). Christmas day is a public holiday, and so is New Year's. It's also the end of the year when most people want to use up their paid time off. Nobody likes having a holiday on two Thursdays followed by work on Friday. Nor do we want to encourage people to carry vacation days to the next year. So we're happy to take the bulk time off at least, and it gives time for people to arrange school paperwork. It is technically a sin in Islam to celebrate other religious holidays. Heck, if you want to go deep into the dogma, everything besides the two Eids shouldn't be celebrated and that includes Prophet Muhammad's birthday and New Year's. But you'll see very heated debates about this that I won't go into. Christmas lies in a weird place on this spectrum. Some say Abrahamic holidays are fine, some say most 'Islamic' holidays are blasphemy. People argue about the Santa hats too. However, Christmas food is perfectly halal. Turkey, peppermint, non-alcoholic egg nog, various desserts. You'll see \"end of year\" dinners by Muslim restaurants that cater to this. Culturally, many of us do have Christian family and friends. So it is a convenient time to meet family and just have an excuse to cook complex Western dishes once a year. Gift giving is rare. You'll see secret Santa stuff at the workplace and in schools. 90% of people in the region do not have disposable income, so expensive gifts are frowned on, as they create pressure. Most are under $25, like fancy soap, snacks, chocolate, a power bank. There's also a culture where charity should be hidden, so stuff usually gets put in a box with no names and the boxes are pseudorandomly distributed. reply",

On the other hand, the Christian (apocryphal) idea that hope came into the world on the (almost) darkest day of the year is beautiful to me.  As well as the idea that some ancient Hebrews miraculously survived in a cave. I also like the idea that the celebrations start with advent like they do in Germany or that there are “12 days of Christmas” ending with the epiphany,  which is a real astronomical event which is part of the explanation of why Christians celebrate the day that they do.

The accumulation of wealth, tax havens and excessive speculation are all modern forms of greed. > Envy. Envy is a deep-seated vice: it means wanting what someone else has. These days, marketing and advertising constantly make us dream of other people’s lives, in a competition where everyone tries to compare themselves, without ever being satisfied with what they are and what they have. In particular, social networking platforms … > Anger.  But the modern economy, by creating the best and the worst, generates inhuman inequalities that arouse anger in everyone. > Lust. Lust is the immoderate pursuit of sexual desire. The MindGeek company, which brings together the major platforms of the pornographic industry, including YouPorn, Pornhub, etc., is enjoying worldwide success. > Gluttony. Gluttony, as we all know, is not a passing fancy. It’s a compulsive need for food pleasure. As the modern economy constantly pushes us to consume, it also pushes those who can afford it to eat non-stop… > Laziness. Finally, laziness is not just weariness. It is the refusal of physical, moral and intellectual effort. There you go. We are creating tools that even think for us. So, only a few among us actually believe in the child’s message, and behave accordingly, (actions count, really they do) or at least try to. :-) [0] https://julienchevalier.com/en/the-economy-of-the-7-deadly-s... reply",

Not quite an oxymoron but certainly a puzzlement. Maybe, generously, in retrospect, an aspiration? I never considered myself an actual engineer; I was (and still am) a self-taught un-credentialed computer programmer. More art than science. They made me take the title and the stock options and the business cards. I mostly worked for and with EEs, making software tools for test automation. I was a fanboy hardware wannabee (and still am), got some on me but was never a true engineer. I learned from those who practiced their discipline; it was plain to me the reality of real engineering versus what I was doing. I suppose in my travels I have on occasion encountered a true Software Engineer. I suppose there's reason to hope that software development will continue to mature and evolve, and eventually the other engineering disciplines will accept software as a science. For me, it will always be a joy to make that hardware work with my twiddly bits. Not engineering, no. But very rewarding work that often resembles engineering. reply",

Realistically, most people don't get to work on meaningful cutting-edge projects. Of those who do, few are moving the needle. Education might not be the best path to a fulfilling job either. Personally, I find fulfilment at a much smaller scale, away from the spotlight. I write software to support another goal: simplifying local bureaucracy. It's not as glamourous as AI and rockets, but I have a grateful audience and a lot of agency over my work. Working on my own stuff has brought back the joy of programming for me. I do a little bit of everything, and it's always in support of a greater objective. This might be something interesting to you. reply",

          "text": "I would say that Go is the best gateway into compiled languages. It is simple(it has very little syntactic sugar), has a ton of available libraries, comes with its own compiler, compiles in 1-2 seconds, has world class support for concurrency, is garbage collected so you do not have to manually manage the memory and therefore it will not feel too strange coming from JS, the standard library is batteries-included, a ton of online content to help out with learning and solving problems... overall the best developer experience as the ecosystem is top notch. After you learn about pointers, different style of OOP, etc.. you can switch to something with manual memory management like Odin, Zig or Rust. I would say, try Go for six months, then, if you want, move to one of the other languages. In a year, your career might be completely transformed and many new avenues will become available to you. THEN you can start thinking about what you'd like to do. reply",

You can (and should!) ignore it and not miss out on anything. Make a profile. Update it occasionally when you're job searching. Forget about the site until you need it. Hit the unsubscribe button when they e-mail you suggestions. The exception is people who simply cannot resist getting pulled into a feed and scrolling it.

Once enough people join, we can launch our own open feed that connects directly to the people you follow. No need for the big platforms at all. You pull updates straight from their sites in real time and move freely without losing your content or your audience. It reuses the network effects we already have while giving you true ownership and independence.

You're right that it's used differently for finding candidates, but I still don't engage with the feed. At most I've posted that I have a job opening as a post (not a job listing). The problem is that it's heavily biased toward people who spend a lot of time on LinkedIn scrolling the feed, which in my experience isn't the most positive signal for people you want to hire to focus on your work. Similar story for hiring people who spend all day posting on any social media: They tend to be distracted by their social media fixation and it's hard to keep them focused on work communications instead of their current online argument. reply",

It's deadlock, for every thread you care about.  (2) Automation in job applications and a declining job market have both made networking more essential, so there's no tolerance for lost connections, so you'd also have to solve those problems too before all would switch.  (3)  Even if users don't like it and could surmount the coordination costs of switching, if companies continue to rely on it, switching would be a career-limiting move; and because companies cannot signal their recruitment strategies without triggering a stampede to game their system, companies tend to keep quiet, so no company would lead an exodus. Still, no one (outside influencers) likes how work networking and recruitment happens today, so user might do both linkedin and some new system if one created a more effective networking and recruitment mode (e.g., for some well-defined, high-value subset, like recent Stanford MBA's, YC alumni, FinTech, ...). reply",

So once LinkedIn stops providing the value that gives it its dominance, and/or someone finds a way to deliver more value, you'll see your competition. That's your answer. Seemingly nobody has found a good enough angle or opportunity, And FWIW, sure the network effect is hard to replace, but not even close to impossible. Just ask the dozens of other social networks that have fallen from greatness. It just means a competitor has to deliver outsize value to overcome the inherent network effect that they're competing with. reply",

I am a greybeard linux admin moonlighting in windows world, and the state of infra in ms land is baaaaadddd. When I tell engineers though, I get a thousand justifications about why its ok that its this bad (because it was worse before, etc), because the tooling is so bad it gets in the way of accomplishing your goals. Same mentality... I personally don't really understand it. Either you control your compute or you don't. Thats who linkedin draws.

There is no need for a contender because Linkedin is a poorly thought solution to an ill addressed problem.

          "text": "Why is there strong competition for every other social media site? This seems to come down to a few market dynamics:\n1. The major influencers who adopt it and bring their followers\n2. New networks bring new leaderboards which attract the next generation that has zero equity on the existing sites\n3. Regular engagement is critical, otherwise every network faces a death spiral\n4. Engagement required to drive ad revenue LinkedIn is notable for not being affected by these:\n1. There are no major influencers (though they tried.) The most influential person on LinkedIn is very close in value to the median software engineer\n2. There are no significant leaderboards (though they tried.) Few people care how many followers others have\n3. Regular engagement doesn't matter, because it is still the Schelling point for irregular life events (ie needing a job.) \n4. Most of their revenue comes from subscriptions for recruiters, so the lower engagement is not an existential crisis. LinkedIn is an always-on jobs expo pretending to be social media. Even the executives think they are social media. They are actually something else. Some angles to compete:\n1. Build better data for an underserved segment. Obvious choice is SWE, but MSFT owns Github as a firewall here. Another candidate is the top 1% of executives: they might be the major influencers that haven't been activated yet.\n2. Build an identity layer that mitigates risk of fake job seekers. LinkedIn has halfheartedly tried this but their inertia might be an opportunity.\n3. Build the Github for other segments: the verifiable portfolios that show real work. \n4. Build a frontrunner to the hiring pipeline. If every star candidate can be identified three months before they start looking on LinkedIn, the recruiting system there will fall apart. \n5. Build the workplace social media network that users actually want to use daily. LinkedIn failed at this, and their effort indicates they see the risk of disruption coming from here. Some existing companies that are on the right track:\n1. Slack. Already owns DAU for work, well-funded, competes with MSFT in many domains. 30% confident they've considered moving into this space, but Benioff getting AI-pilled will slow it down.\n2. Behance. Owned the market for designers, sold to Adobe, game over.\n2. Glassdoor. Useful data that LinkedIn doesn't own, but they seem to have embraced the Yelp business model instead.\n3. Fishbowl. Daily engagement solved but they've backed into a local maxima.\n4. Upwork. Stuck with low-end brand that will prevent them from winning this market.\n5. X. Has all the pieces except for a leader who cares about a jobs board. Would need a certain kind of leader for their jobs product to get it to win.\n6. Every other talent startup: fighting for the right revenue, but they almost always approach it from the transactional staffing model or the ATS subscription model. Would need someone to buy all of them up and launch a network with 100M profiles on day one. reply",

        "text": "<div class=\"toptext\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Today is the worst day of my life. We live in a country near Cambodia, and as you know, it is kind of a dream land for scammers. Today, it happened to my family.<p>My mother received a call from a scammer. They told her she needed to process some tax issue and prove that her bank account had enough money. In just a few minutes, they tricked her and manipulated her into entering banking OTP codes. All of her savings are now gone.<p>What makes this more dramatic is that last year I architected and helped a government department in my country build a big system. This system can track money flows across the whole country, to know where money comes from. I was very proud of this. It is the biggest achievement of my life. Even if nobody knows I built it, that was fine.<p>But now I cannot protect my own mother. I cannot protect my family. My system can track the money, but it is almost impossible to get it back.<p>When I went to the police, just in one small area, there were more than 20 cases in a single day. A hardworking student sent all their family's money, thinking it was for university fees or going abroad. An old factory worker lost all her retirement savings. So many people lost everything. That is when I realized that the system I built, the system I was proud of, is not enough.<p>All my own savings are gone too. (My mother was scammed into borrowing a lot of money and sending it to the scammers, and now it is my responsibility.) I had plans for the next few years: to do open source work, to write books about math and programming, to create a dream Go web framework, to give back to the community. Now all of that is gone.<p>But this is not only about me. I can still start over. I am strong enough to rebuild my life. But who will protect people like my mother? Or a poor student? Or a factory worker? Or so many others?<p>I can build systems. I can build distributed systems that scale to a whole country. But for what? What should I do?<p>I have been reading Hacker News for 12 to 13 years, sometimes posting from other accounts. I am writing here now to ask for advice and help from this community.<p>If anyone has experience with similar cases, or ideas on what can realistically be done, or even advice on how to move forward after something like this, I would really appreciate it. I will keep this account semi-private, because with the details above, I think some engineers from my country may recognize me.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>",

They can even trick a person into selling expensive property (real estate) and then steal the money. One thing is the government must act. These calls are mostly done from abroad. Phone companies can implement some protective measures. Banks too need to watch for common patterns (doesn't always help because scammers talk the victim around the checks). The society as a whole needs to get aware. What a single person could do is to keep contact with the relatives. I've read an expert report on one such case; the author wrote that even a single close someone could break the trance and stop the scam. In that case the victim happened to be a popular singer seemingly never alone, yet as it turned out she actually was a lone old lady with not a single confidant close enough for more than a month. She was, of course, shattered with what happened (she lost close to $3M), but after some time in one if her interviews she said: \"I will survive\". She said it in Russian and did not comment on the phrase further, it must be too personal. Yet of course she meant that song. The song helps her. The song's story is different, but the emotion is same. We have all our love to give. A hard hit will do good if it makes us to commit on that. reply",

Not a nice old lady after all. I haven't been following the case closely, but it seems like the decision has been overturned. Similar to Streisand Effect, there's now in Russia the term Dolina Effect [0] after this singer, referring to these \"grandma schemes\" where criminals direct the elderly to sell their property and then renege, relying on courts siding with them to keep the property and the money.

          "text": "Sorry to hear this. From where I am (India), there’s hardly anything that you can do because it’s likely that the ones with power won’t do anything. As an individual, you can only focus on yourself and those you know and try to educate them as much as is possible. These kind of scams have become a huge problem in India (look up “digital arrest” scams). People of all backgrounds and age groups have lost a lot of money (to put it in US dollar equivalent amounts, imagine a person losing few hundred thousand dollars to a couple of million dollars). There is nothing like “digital arrest” in Indian laws. The government has tried to warn people about this. The larger problem seems to be a combination of factors across disinterested entities: 1. The police aren’t interested in solving these (there’s a separate division for cybercrime). Filing a formal report is usually thwarted and avoided by the police. Even if they show some interest, it always involves paying them fat sums of money. There’s no guarantee that they can recover the money. 2. The banks aren’t interested in solving this. It seems like specific bank branch managers are involved and just stand by allowing large transactions (like cash withdrawals) to just be approved without raising any questions or concerns. All the talk by banks about “risk management” (alongside compliance matters) goes out the window just for the victims of these scams. 3. With SMS OTPs being common and the scammers recruiting some locals to run SIM farms/phone farms, the telecom companies aren’t interested in solving issues within themselves either. Though there is a limit of nine phone numbers (total) per person in India, and though there is on paper a KYC process (including a live video) to get a phone number, the telecom companies have systems and employees who can provide numerous numbers based on stolen or fake IDs. 4. The government is a bystander and appears helpless. Instead of creating laws and enforcing existing laws, it focuses on some awareness that these scams are not genuine. 5. The Supreme Court finally ordered CBI (the Indian equivalent of FBI) to investigate these scams. So there you have it: none of the entities involved has any interest or will to do something about the problem. There will always be excuses that the scammers are in another country. reply",

The best thing you can do is help to educate people, maybe create an organization that can work with other organizations to target youth and senior knowledge.

One of my grandmothers was way too knowledgeable and crafty to fall for it, even pleas like, \"Grandma, I'm in jail and need help...\" absolutely failed in practice.  For better or worse, my other Grandmother had been scammed a couple times and towards the end of her life didn't have the finances to scam any more from, living with my mom and her sisters. Unfortunately the scams themselves range from amazingly complex to what should be really easy to spot.  I make it a rule to NEVER give personal information to someone that calls me unexpectedly, at least nothing that isn't already effectively public information. Annoying when your doctor's office has an automated system that calls and the first thing it does is ask for your social security number...  My response is \"nope, not doing it\" and that's what I told anyone that would listen at that office every visit... it's training people to get scammed. reply",

One urgent warning I want to share is about how scammers are now using AI. In my country, they are already using AI for video calls, voice cloning, and highly scripted conversations. The person on the screen can look and sound real. The conversation feels natural and authoritative. For many people, especially older relatives, it is almost impossible to tell that it is fake. This is no longer about obvious scam messages or bad phone calls. AI is making scams feel personal and trustworthy. Please warn your families.

No legitimate organization needs full, permanent control over your bank account. If a situation feels incredibly urgent, it is almost certainly a scam. • Taxes? The government already has the access they need.\n• Loans or Visas? Ask for payment instructions or a formal bank certification instead. Everything can wait a day—except a scammer.

They basically \"waste the scammers time\".  The scams rely on low effort ways to find the target, robocalls, emails, etc.  But once the target is found they have to put real effort into implementation.  With AI, this will only become easier on their end. I would look into solutions that would make it harder for them.  Like AI chatbots that act like targets, both text and voice.  If the majority of their efforts end up being weeks of conversation with an AI before they figure it out then it will not be worth the effort. Right now it may take them hours to find a viable target then days to extort them.  Make it take longer, until it is more lucrative to get a legitimate job. I used to think it was fun to mess with scammers... but I think these days many of them are forced into it.  Basically they are lured in with reasonable sounding job offers then once they find themselves in another country with only their \"employer\" look out for them, they basically become slave labor. You need to hurt the ones trapping the slaves that run the scams, and your weapon is the same as theirs... technology. reply",

          "text": "(If you're OP: this is not a solution per se but more of a generalist rant; just so you don't waste critical time) People talk about changing laws or technical solutions, but the inconvenient truth is that technically literate people should peer-pressure nearby friends/family/etc. into being more aware of such possibilities. I've done so, to the extent that some people find it ether borderline schizophrenic/paranoid (to my \"luck\", I live in an ex-communist country, where most people are usually skeptical in many contexts with strangers; so this group of people is relatively small). People who know better bear a responsibility towards helping others who don't; towards those who are too kind (or naive) for their own good; Even though I'm the \"tech guy\" in my close circles (family, friends,etc.) like many here, I often do the >opposite< of what other \"pro-technologists\" do these days: I don't encourage people, especially the older generation OR the more tech-illiterate ones to use more technology, because it is obvious that doing so \"injects\" another vector of attacks into their lives. More often these days this is not possible, everything gets digitalized to the detriment of such groups, but this also delves into the politics of keeping \"older options\" (cash, paper trails, etc.) available even if digitalization happens. Often times the older options are more secure, though obviously less convenient. This is a non-solution, yes, but it is the correct way to approach this (imo), as more and more places LEGALLY force digitalization of different institutions(banking, gov. agencies, etc.)  which inherently either add, or worse, completely shift the risk into virtual spaces. This is why a \"legal\" solution is more often than not either a slow one or a completely pointless one. It will always be an arms-race between scammers(which operate more effectively[in theory] due to their decentralized nature) and the gov./banks/etc., which operate in a more centralized fashion, thus demanding and imposing more control above all included parties. A legal way will always demand more than it's worth. I digress from my shift into politics, but bottom line is this: don't let your peers/family/closed ones get into these situations. If you have \"an authoritative\" voice regarding tech, use it to first cultivate awareness regarding dangers, before cultivating hype/or anything else. (Obviously not talking about anyone specifically, but the whole \"geeksphere\" as a whole) Good luck to you and your family. reply",

          "text": "> about rust. Is it better than, for example, oberon, or it's descendents? It's a completely different language with different focus and features. \"better\" depends on the requirements you want to solve with the language. Rust can do memory management at compile time whereas Oberon and its descendants (such as my Oberon+ version) use a garbage collector at runtime. Rust is much bigger and more complex than Oberon, but it also has features which make it more suitable for systems programming. Simpler is not automatically better. If a language is too \"simple\" (i.e. minimalist), the complexity often shifts from the language specification to the application code, requiring more boilerplate or \"clever\" tricks to solve complex problems. And it was not only simplicity (as Vidar assumed), but Oberon indeed had a different approach to OO in that there were no bound procedures, but the idea was (as you can observe e.g. in the Oberon systems and in publication by Wirth an his PhD students) that \"type extension\" (i.e. inheritance) is used to create extensible message hierarchies, which then are polymorphically handled by procedures accepting a VAR parameter of the most general message type. In this handler, the messages are dispatched by the IS operator or the WITH or CASE statement. This has similar effects as e.g achievable by sum types, and interestingly is closer to e.g. Alan Kay's view of OO than the implementation found in Smalltalk-80 (notably, Wirth arrived at this message-centric model independently of Kay’s work in the Smalltalk lineage). reply",

Kay's view is actually based on messages, as implemented in Erlang, for example, and to some extent in Smalltalk-72. Cox, on the other hand, has implemented the object and dispatch model of Smalltalk 80, that Ingalls invented and published in 1978, almost exactly, even with the same method lookup caching. > Cox's book uses this example a lot as a poor/insufficient substitute for dynamic dispatch. The Wirth and Smalltalk approach are both fundamentally \"late-bound search\" mechanisms, differing mainly in whether the search state is optimizable by a central engine (VM) or fixed in the user's explicit control flow (Handler). This is a classic example of dualism in computer science, specifically the Expression Problem (or the Data/Operation duality). You are simply traversing a 2D matrix of (Types × Operations), just choosing a different axis as primary. It's mathematically isomorphic, both are performing a directed graph traversal to find the code that matches (CurrentType, CurrentMessage). Only the ergonomics and possibility for caching differ. Smalltalk hides the dispatch loop in the VM, which can do caching and the dispatch effort goes from O(N) to O(1) in time. Wirth exposes the dispatch loop in the WITH statements with a dispatch effort continuously O(N). reply",

So when a titan like Wirth endorses it..  ..there is obviously something of great importance that needs to be clearly understood, and that is -not- obvious. The same thing when I see mentions of C++.  Except that I haven't yet found endorsements of it from anybody of Wirth's stature.  Sites like suckless really do not help.

In a wider sense, its general design of making all its ``objects'' look like files to which one talks in a well-defined protocol shows a related approach. \" reply",

          "text": "Raymond argues in the referenced book that while OOP has value in specific domains, its benefits have been oversold and its typical usage often conflicts with the core Unix philosophy of simplicity and transparency. I think that's a valid position, and hyping and overselling is a continuous fad in the programming industry, which is famously susceptible to what Fred Brooks called the \"Silver Bullet\" syndrome: the desperate search for a single magical technology that will solve the inherent difficulties of software engineering. The \"simplicity and transparency\" Raymond champions are indeed virtues, but they are also slogans used to rally a specific community. Just as \"Memory Safety\" is the rallying cry for Rust today, \"Small is Beautiful\" was the rallying cry for Unix in the 1970s. The industry seems to advance not by finding a static \"truth,\" but by lurching between opposing philosophies, each powered by its own wave of activism. I recommend to ignore the \"moral\" arguments, but to focus on the engineering trade-offs. Most \"revolutions\" are just rediscoveries of old ideas. Functional Programming is largely Lisp (1958) re-branded. The \"Anti-OO\" movement is partly a return to procedural modularity (Pascal/C). Our job is not to be \"pure\"; your job is to build working, maintainable software using the best tools we can find for the specific problem at hand. reply",

          "text": "Ada and Wirth’s languages (including Modula-2) represent fundamentally opposing schools of thought regarding language design, despite their shared ALGOL-60 heritage and partly related syntax. Ada is in every aspect a much bigger and more powerful (e.g. concerning the ability of the compiler to assist you in writing safe low-level code) language than any of the Wirth languages. Wirth famously criticized Ada as being \"uneconomical\"; he believed that because Ada’s requirements were so \"baroque\" and contradictory, the resulting language was inevitably overloaded with features whose marginal benefits did not justify their complexity ( https://archive.org/details/Computer_Language_Issue_09_1985-... ). But when you e.g. study the Oberon system, you see that it depended on \"tricks\" (e.g. SYSTEM.PUT/GET, VAR ARRAY of SYSTEM.BYTE) which were not properly integrated in the language concepts and had to be used without any typechecking support by the compiler. reply",

For 20 years after the program is written, programmers will have to read it to maintain it. \" This contrasts with the \"fire and forget\" attitude of many developers, which often manifests as a \"write-once\" culture, where the primary goal is to get the logic into the machine as quickly as possible, with little regard for the human who must read it later. reply",

Mesa (a language developed at Xerox PARC, where Wirth made his sabbaticals) is cited as a source for the module/package concept. Modula (referring to Modula-1, 1977) is cited in the context of concurrency and low-level hardware access (e.g., handling interrupts, device drivers), and for the general concept of the module as a syntactic unit. From the timeline we can assume that Modula-2 had not arrived at the design team when they released their proposal to the DoD. Notably, Wirth had actually submitted his own proposal to the DoD (the \"Yellow\" language, via SRI in 1977), though he withdrew it early because he felt the requirements were too complex. Unfortunately, no public specification of the \"Yellow\" language exists, but it was very likely not Modula-2. reply",

My immediate thought for a build: just a camera with on-device VLMs and LLMs. You could point it at a normal whiteboard (or a wall of sticky notes), and the model could interpret the handwriting, track the tokens, and sync the state digitally in real-time without needing any special \"smart\" hardware. It feels like a much more flexible approach than an expensive proprietary whiteboard. Would a camera-only setup cover your use case? reply",

Click on any function call then the callee shows up in a new window with proper highlighting. Click on a struct object it immediately shows the struct def in a panel stick to the bottom of the screen. Essentially, it’s like VSCode Peek definition but with a different visual style, and similar to the same functionality of source insight but free and in Linux. The purpose is to read xv6 source code. I have found some parts of the kernel, e.g. the file system to be convoluted, and I need to follow quite a few jumps to form the system mindset. Having such a small tool is very helpful. Actually it doesn’t look too hard to implement. Maybe I’ll write it myself in QT. reply",
