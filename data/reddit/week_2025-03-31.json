        "text": "\nThis is a “burner account” according to my wife to keep anonymous.\n\n\nI and a 42-year old man who was Muslim for all my life. I have one beautiful child and had one wife.\n\nTwo years ago today my son had been showing me signs, painting his nails, talking in ways i wasn’t familiar with, but he kept it quiet, he knew where we were from being gay wasn’t even on the table.\n\nSo, he sat me down, knowing that in our culture being gay is grounds for exile and in some extreme cases, execution. He said “dad..I like other boys”. He told me I was the first and only person he’d ever told.\n\nI can remember how he looked at me, he looked at me with such fear it made me want to take my eyes out. I didn’t want him to ever look at me that way again.\n\nI can’t say I wasn’t disappointed, I had always wanted him to carry on my beliefs in life and to have children who were also Muslim.\n\nBut I knew as a father that I had an obligation, and I can’t say for a second that I loved Allah more than my child. I would be sinning and lying to Allah and myself.\n\nSo, one day within that same month, me, my wife, and my son sat down with our family and said we were leaving for “work”. We weren’t, we left the country. My father was vehemently against gays, against everything my son was. So I knew that saying a word would get my baby crucified by the community, no life, no job, no happiness.\n\nSo we left.\n\nWe got the money, the means, and booked a one way to Canada and have been living there since. My son is now 16 and I don’t regret what I or my wife did, I love my son and I hope he knows that. He’s even got himself a boyfriend, I’m not sure about everything but I’m trying.\n\nMy wife hardly wears her hijab anymore and I haven’t prayed to Allah since we left and may He forgive me, I don’t want to.

The stress would have hurt him, and hurt those around him. You and your wife left your whole life behind you to build a future for him. He will never forget that, and it will carry forward for him. \n\nSo many gay people are rejected by their families. It leaves such a deep wound, that often never fully heals. You saved him from that, and if he doesn't know that now, he will. \n\nIt also sounds like your wife feels more free. Do you?",

          "text": "As the son of a different, but as faithful man who also protected me when he discovered my “secret, which wasn’t secret to anyone with a brain, what I can tell you are two things.  First, any god who would deny you for protecting your son, isn’t a god worth worshiping.  Second, you have ensured not only that your son will have a full life, he will remember what you did, and he will be there for you.  As the youngest of 7 boys, I was the “white sheep.”  I did everything right, except for being gay - which was simply how I was born.  I was the one who went for an education.  I was the one who fought tooth and nail for a better life for my family and me.  And I built that life, so that when my father, a man who worked every day of his life for his family, could no longer work - I had the means to make sure he, my mother, and the rest of the family was cared for.  And, I was the last son with him in his ailing days.  I held his hand, and tucked him in the night he passed away.  I was in, very many ways, a mamma’s boy, but my dad loved me, sacrificed for me, stood up for me when others said I was evil.  He loved my husband like all of his daughter in laws - frankly even more so, because my husband was more like my dad than any of them or even I was.  My husband and I laughed and talked with him when we got him in bed in the hospital.  We both told him we loved him, and he said the same.  At 7:30 the next morning, when my alarm was set to wake me, my mother called telling me the nurse found him dead 5 minutes before.\n\nI was also the son who took care of his wife, my mother, after he passed.  I ensured she never wanted for anything - a promise I made to my father as a way to pay him back for helping with college.  I kept a spreadsheet and tried to give him money with interest, and he refused, instead asking me to ensure my mother was safe and taken care of.\n\nYou’ve done an amazingly difficult thing.  But there is absolutely no question in any person who has the capability to think critically, that you did the right thing.  Your son will never forget it, I promise you.",

It is only right to leave a religion, when it poses a threat to your family, your family is more important.\n\nThere will be intolerant people in every country around the world, but the risk of getting harmed because of things like being gay is much lower in the west.\n\nI live in the middle of Europe and my city was a center for the christian reformation, in my church, we removed everything like the pope, cardinals, bishops etc. We removed sins and virtues, we removed almost all rituals and prayers, we removed even parts of the bible and we removed the concepts like heaven and hell. So while i'm not religious myself, i can live with these tolerant people, because they are very easy.\n\nLike when you say \"I'm gay\", then the priest from the church will answer with \"That's good, we wish you the best for your life. If you are gay, then Jesus will agree with it and he would not see any kind of problem, instead, he'd like to bless you\". That's real religious tolerance. While these people believe in Jesus and God, they won't judge you, they won't hurt you.",

As a queer and trans person, thank you. \n\nAnd since you are struggling with your religion still, I’d really recommend finding communities of people in similar situations. I know it’s not the exact same, but there are a lot of Christian churches putting in the extra work to make them welcoming for queer and trans people, and you might be able to speak with those communities to find support. And there’s also a lot of history about how an original translation in the Bible essentially was saying how it was bad to be a pedophile, not be gay, but the church pushed for it to be interpreted as “it’s a sin to be gay” in the 1950s or something, I can’t remember exactly. Maybe someone else knows what I’m talking about. Idk if there’s something similar with the Quran. There might also be communities of queer and trans Muslims on here and elsewhere, too 🙏🏻\n\nI hope you find peace and solace knowing you did the right thing. Thank you for going to Canada 🙏🏻",

At least, better than totally removing yourself from this space.\n\nThat being said, for safety please do not go around telling the world he’s gay.

        "text": "Throwaway because my wife would kill me if she knew I was posting this.\n\nSo, I (31M) and my wife (30F) have been married for only a few months now, but I wanted to share a story she told me back when we were still dating. It’s something that made me realize just how strong she really is.\n\nWhen my wife was a teenager, she had a horrible ex. He was mentally abusive—constantly manipulating her by threatening self-harm if she didn’t do what he wanted. He insulted her, called her fat (even though she was actually underweight at the time), and never defended her when others mistreated her. To make things worse, he harassed his little cousin—something my wife found out about later, and it was the final straw for her. She broke up with him immediately.\n\nFast forward a year later. My wife was in college, and life had moved on—until one night when she ran into him again. There was a festival being celebrated at her junior college around 8 p.m., and she had gone inside to grab something from her bag. Somehow, this absolute creep had managed to sneak into the building. He had been studying in another state, but he came back for the holidays, and instead of, I don’t know, not being a predator, he used his free time to stalk and ambush my wife.\n\nYou can probably guess what he tried to do.\n\nNow, keep in mind, my wife was only 5’1\" and about 50 kg (110 lbs) at the time. He was around 6 feet tall and had a weight advantage on her. But guess what? She didn’t just sit there and take it.\n\nShe fought.\n\nShe dodged his attempts, kicked him hard in the groin, and when he doubled over, she dug her nails into his face and dragged them down with everything she had. By the time he was done screaming in pain, his face was a bloody mess.\n\nIt took 10 stitches (I originally thought it was 12, but my wife corrected me). His face was never the same after that. And when people heard the commotion and rushed in, they found my wife standing over him while he was writhing on the floor.\n\nI don’t know what happened to him after that, and frankly, I don’t care. But I do know one thing—he never bothered her again.\n\nAnd now? Now, she’s married to me, someone who actually respects and loves her. She survived, she fought back, and she won. And I have never, ever been prouder of her.\n\n(I used ai to refine this bc english isn't my first language)\n\n",

But speaking for myself, I'd rather read less grammatical and more personal posts. There's a lot of character that comes through in English written from the perspective of a non-native speaker, and I really enjoy it. It gives a much better sense of the human behind the words, and often reveals interesting cultural &amp; linguistic differences that are fun to learn about. Thinking about a future where everyone is ashamed to write their own words because they don't sound like the bland \"professional\" output of LLM makes me really sad.",

I was 17 and mentally just... shutting down. One night, I woke up to the sound of her struggling to breathe. I knew it was serious, I could hear it — like this horrible choking sound.\n\nBut I didn’t get up. I just laid there in my bed, pretending to be asleep. I don’t even know why. I was scared, I didn’t know what to do, and some part of me thought maybe if I just waited, someone else would handle it.\n\nShe died that night. Alone.\n\nI can’t stop thinking: what if I had gotten up? What if I had called someone? Would she still be alive? Or at least not alone?\n\nI never told anyone I was awake. My family thinks I slept through the night. I don't know if I should confess or keep this secret buried.\n\nHave you ever done something out of fear that you regret for the rest of your life? Does the guilt ever go away?",

Any hospice nurse worth their degree would have realized your mother was about to pass. They should have checked, checked, quadrouple checked you knew what you were up against. \n\nIf you would like to talk through that experience, my inbox is open.

It was never going to end well. But it ended. And now things are different. \n\nIf you had gotten up - the ending would have been different, but it still would have ended. \n\nIf you had called someone, you'd have missed witnessing her death. \n\nShe would not still be alive. The cancer got her and it got her bad. \n\nShe is not alone anymore. She lives on through the memories of everyone who loved her and the lessons she taught. I have done many things I still regret. I told my big brother not to go to the hospital and less than 72 hours later he died. The guilt does go away though but it takes a lot of work and hard conversations. He was an adult and could make his own decisions. He would have never blamed me. I know that in my heart, because he loved me. I'm sure your mom loved you beyond your wildest beliefs too and was glad to witness you in her last moments. Her baby. \n\nDeath IS scary. But the scariest part is the people we leave behind. And I'm sure your mother would hate to know that she is causing you pain. She would NEVER want you to blame yourself. She would want you to be happy. Learn from her. Tell others your favorite memory of her. I'm sure there were more good stories than bad ones like this. Your mother was more than a final choking sound. She was a woman. One that brought you into this world and taught you all kinds of things. Remember her like that.",

At that point you cannot save that person. As far as we know people who are in that state do not suffer because they are barely alive anymore. Once the death rattle sets on, it's only a matter of hours till a person dies.\n\nIt is okay that you were exhausted. You were so young and overwhelmed and watching your mom die is horrifyingly hard. You couldn't have saved her. I am sorry for your loss and maybe speaking to a therapist might help with the guilr",

I saw the awful traumatic pain and confusion and overwhelm of a 17 year old child trying to somehow comprehend such a visceral, painful loss such as this.\n\nPlease don't go continuing to punish and shame your 17-year old self. They were heartbroken, in pieces, terrified. \n\nIf ever she couldve known, your mother wouldn't have felt an ounce of resentment or judgement at all. She'd have felt nothing but sorrow and sadness that her child had to witness any of this in the first place, the last thing a mother would focus on or think about is how their grief stricken child \"acted\". \n\nPain is pain. In one way or another, it melts us all in our own unique way, brings us all to our knees no matter how hard we try to resist and refrain from the hurt of of it all.\n Even the most stoic of us can't truly deny how pain and loss seems to penetrate so unapologetically into the guts of our psyche in one way or another. Leaving us feeling ever so slightly different to the people we once were before the loss happened. It is the ultimate violation of one's sense of self.\n\nHow we handle it is subject to our age, our life experience, our upbringing...and even that doesn't truly define it. In the moment in which you face grief as sorrowful as you have, could anyone accurately predict the ways in which they will react there and then?\n\nThe loss of someone as special as your mother, any loss of a person who meant something in our lives...the grief is so palpitating, so potent, so mercilessly jarring - all being a stark signifier of the sincere abundance of love that was there in the first place. Complex or easy as is the nature of most families...regardless, the love is there at its core. The more it hurts, the bigger the proof of how hard you loved.\n\n\nI hope, sincerely, that you begin to heal now. And see your actions in a completely different light, as time marches on. You were not cold, selfish, cowardly nor callous. You were a child, frozen and suspended by blind panic and dread and grief. Your mother knew the pain you were feeling. Now, it's time for you to forgive yourself.",

She too had cancer and was on Hospice at home.\n\nI'm an RN, and I worked mainly Stepdown and Critical Care when I was on the floor. I've seen many people pass, and I knew what to expect. Even still, it was very hard watching and listening to her death rattle. And I literally thought to myself that if I didn't have the background I did, I would have been terrified and most definitely traumatized, and I started to wonder what it must be like for people who haven't ever seen that.\n\nMy mom lasted less than 5 days on Hospice, and 2 of the days were the weekend, so the nurses hadn't even had time to explain what I might see or hear. And I remember well that learning about it in school and then actually seeing it and hearing it in real life were two completely different things.\n\nDon't feel bad. You were young, and you were in no way prepared for that. There is nothing you could have done. At that point, even having suction in a hospital wouldn't have helped. It was part of the process. And as far as her being alone--I saw many patients who were dying and were mostly or completely unresponsive stay alive while family was visiting, then within minutes of their family leaving, they pass. And many people pass in the middle of the night while loved ones are sleeping. It's okay. You have nothing to feel guilty about. You're mom was taken care of, and had the amazing gift of being able to pass comfortably at home.",

          "text": "I was 17 and listened to my step-grandfather die at the end of his cancer battle. My grandmother was talking and didn't hear it. He hadn't been lucid or able to identify who was in the room. I don't know why it felt right, but I didn't want my grandmother to witness it. I stared at the clock above the mantle and counted 90 seconds before I said that we needed to go check on him. I remember those 90 seconds more clearly than I remember my prom, unfortunately. Many many years later, I still think it was the right call. He wasn't aware, so her presence wouldn't have comforted him in those final few seconds. She would've had an awful final image of hin. I don't know if it was right. I don't know if I did something evil by waiting. All I know is that I had more certainty at 17 then that it's what I needed to do than I've had in most situations since. I'll trust that, y'know? \n\nI think you should trust that for yourself too. You don't need to know why. You just need to know that it's what you felt you had to do then. Perhaps your mother's final prayer had been that you wouldn't see that final moment, and keeping your eyes shut honored that. The why isn't knowable, so don't let knowing it consume you.",

I was home alone with him and he started choking just as you described. He did it for a little bit before it really clicked in my head what was going on and I tried to help him. Called 911, tried to hold him up, tried to flip him over on his side. It was very traumatic. I know he wouldn’t have wanted me to be put into that position, just as I’m sure your mom probably didn’t want that for you either so try not to beat yourself up over it. She wasn’t alone because even at a small distance, you were there. Even if you had tried to help, it’s likely you may have had the same outcome with the added flair of feeling like a failure because the help you did provide wasn’t enough.\n\nIt was over 15 years ago for me. Sometimes I still get down about it, but for the most part I’ve come to terms with it and it doesn’t weigh quite so hard on my heart because I know my dad wouldn’t want me to dwell on it.",

I blamed myself heavily for years after, and sometimes I still do. In reality, going through this sort of loss, espically from that terrible of a disease, is horrendous. It is one of the hardest things someone can go through and you went through it as a child. The amount of trauma leading up to her death was likely immense. What happened was not your fault. There was nothing you could do. I know that can make it feel worse, but it’s the truth. What you went through and what she went through was not your fault. It may take a while, but the guilt will go away, espically if you realize that what happened wasn’t on you.",

She died \"alone\" too I guess.... There were like 5 of us in the house holding a kind of vigil. Just waiting. Nothing left to do for her, she was breathing but not really there anymore. It was horrible.\n\n No one noticed she had stopped breathing for like a minute? a couple minutes? No idea. We had been checking on her for hours, just waiting there in the house with her. There was nothing to do but wait and let her know it was time to go. \n\n\nIt's okay. It really really sucks and I'm so sorry you went through that. I hope you aren't alone and you can get some counseling or therapy. Talking about it helps but like it SUCKS. It just sucks. I have experienced guilt and shame for like my whole life and like ...you can work on it but does anything ever go away? The love, the laughter, the hope is always there, maybe hard to feel sometimes, but it's still there. \n\nJust try to remember that she's not suffering anymore. Just try to remember the love. \n\n\n(Edited some spelling)",

I couldn’t get myself to answer it and get out of bed to head over to her house. \nI didn’t want to watch it. We all knew she didn’t have much longer and would pass any second. She had been fighting ovarian cancer for over a year, she fought to recover till the very end with no idea that she wouldn’t survive even after 3 months of being in hospice state. She always thought she’d recover. I knew nothing could be done anymore and I was too scared to watch her soul leave her body. I know I’m an adult but I was scared even at 25. Sometimes I think about it and make myself feel guilty by not being by her side on her last breath.",

He's not suffering anymore, and that's what matters most to me.\n\nThis is a little bit mystical, but have you heard of Japanese wind phones? It's worth reading about them.

It was never going to end well. But it ended. And now things are different. \n\nIf you had gotten up - the ending would have been different, but it still would have ended. \n\nIf you had called someone, you'd have missed witnessing her death. \n\nShe would not still be alive. The cancer got her and it got her bad. \n\nShe is not alone anymore. She lives on through the memories of everyone who loved her and the lessons she taught. I have done many things I still regret. I told my big brother not to go to the hospital and less than 72 hours later he died. The guilt does go away though but it takes a lot of work and hard conversations. He was an adult and could make his own decisions. He would have never blamed me. I know that in my heart, because he loved me. I'm sure your mom loved you beyond your wildest beliefs too and was glad to witness you in her last moments. Her baby. \n\nDeath IS scary. But the scariest part is the people we leave behind. And I'm sure your mother would hate to know that she is causing you pain. She would NEVER want you to blame yourself. She would want you to be happy. Learn from her. Tell others your favorite memory of her. I'm sure there were more good stories than bad ones like this. Your mother was more than a final choking sound. She was a woman. One that brought you into this world and taught you all kinds of things. Remember her like that.",

That kind of trauma paralyzes people. It’s easy to look back now and ask “what if,” but in that moment, you were a kid trying to survive something impossibly heavy. Guilt has a way of rewriting history, making us think we had more control than we really did.\n\nGrief twists everything, especially when it’s tied to regret. But your mom wouldn’t want you to carry this pain forever. She knew you loved her. And being frozen in fear doesn’t mean you didn’t care—it means you *did*, deeply. You don’t have to punish yourself to prove that. It’s okay to forgive the scared version of yourself who didn’t know what to do.",

I’m not sure myself but he found out and asked his mother about it and we gave him just a bit of education on the topic. We heavily censored ourselves but he wasn’t completely clueless anymore.\n\nTurns out the next day this little turd went to school and said he was my slave. I of course had to come to the school and have a very long(and very embarrassing) talk with his teacher about where he got it from and how me and my wife talked to him about it a few days prior, she laughed in my face and we just laughed about it, all the while my son’s smiling ear to ear.\n\nTLDR: don’t have kids ",

        "text": "\n\nThis isn’t a cry for pity—it’s just the reality I live with. I have a medically diagnosed micropenis. Fully erect, I’m around 3 - 3.5 inches long and 3 inches in girth. It’s medically classified as a micro penis.\n\nThat alone is embarrassing enough to deal with privately. \n\nBut over the years, the one thing I never expected was how publicly known it would become.\n\nA few exes mentioned it to their friends.  Word got around. And when my wife and I separated two and a half years ago, she didn’t hold back either—she told people I never thought would know. \n\nNow, they all know.\n\nThe size isn’t just a number—it’s a memory. It’s something that’s quietly referenced without being said. I’ve seen people smirk, glance down, exchange looks. I’ve been in rooms where the joke already happened before I arrived. It’s the kind of embarrassment that never announces itself directly, but exists in the spaces between how people speak to you\n\nThe truth is, it’s changed how I relate to everyone around me. It’s not just that I have a micropenis—it’s that it’s been passed around socially, like a story, a punchline, a detail people didn’t ask for but now have. \n\nI live with that.\n\nI’ve thought a lot about posting a photo of myself here—nothing explicit or provocative, but just to attach a face to what’s already been passed around behind my back. If I’m going to be reduced to this, I’d rather be the one who says it. There’s something about putting myself out there, fully named, fully visible, that feels like the only control I have left.",

I wasn't concerned about it and he was awesome in bed.  He really got to work on the foreplay and it was 🔥.  So good!  Then, when we did the deed, it was also good.  He really moved and we tried different positions to see what felt best and it was all good.  \n\nHonestly, I would just put it out there as I think it will weed out judgey assholes and may be a relief to some women with short canals or, as others have mentioned in this thread, women with vaginismus.",

          "text": "Just an average female here giving a perspective. If someone gossiped or whispered something about another person like you probably believe has happened regarding your physical attributes, i would shut them down immediately. Things like that are not important, It shows a lot about a person, if they do this kind of thing. and Im guessing that you are not very old, nor is the group of people you are talking about..  Anyone who is an adult who has lived a little would probably agree thait is far more shameful that anyone would talk about someone like that than the issue they are talking about. Your ex is a piece of shit. You're lucky to be free of her. \n\nA word of encouragement here. Not sure if it will help but here it is. Twenty years ago (after my divorce) I went through a brief period of sexual-well let's just call it sexual freedom. I was slutting around. I was single and meeting a lot of men and enjoying it. One guy I met at my friend's house where I lived for a while after my divorce (let's call him Tom) was so fun and nice that I was really intrigued by him. He asked me if I'd like to sometime \"go help him drink some rum\" he'd picked up. We were both rum lovers. I asked around about him and found out he was a decent guy.  We kept running into each other but were both very busy. We even made a date once and he called me at my friend's house to cancel as he'd gotten called out of town for some reason. He was very flirtatious and had a way of looking at me that just got me going. When we finally jad our \"date\" I was really worked up and we were having fun and later went back to his place and got right to business (after sipping some rum together. He had a micropenis. I have to say t was a little shocking  but it mattered not one bit. Tom was a fricking amazing lover. I don't think I've had better sex with anyone else EVER and we got together quite a few times after that. We had other things going on in our lives and were friends for quite a while but never took it to a romantic level.  Purely fun sex and good times. I'll bet if we were both still single (and had some rum-LOL) we would have some great sex even after all these years. Just thought you should know that to some of us size doesn't matter if a man has other qualities and attributes-along with the effort and taking his time and being eager and exciting. On a side note. I'm a little older now but even as a younger woman (and before my brief period of promiscuity) sex wasn't really terribly important, and this wouldn't have been a deal-breaker even if Tom hadn't neem an amazing lover. Just a different perspective for you.",

      "content": {
        "text": "\n\nUmm.. after reading all of your comments, I just want to say thank you. You all gave me the confidence boost I didn’t even realise I needed. At first, I was fully prepared to pretend the kiss never happened but your words made me stop and think. Maybe there was something there. \n\nAs I said in my previous post I’d be meeting him tomorrow…And today we met so here is the update\n\nTldr below\n\n~~\n\nI decided to put a little effort into what I wore, just in case. I wanted to feel confident, and if things went well, I wanted to look nice. So I picked out a cute floral dress, and the weather was actually nice. We met at this coffee/brunch place we both like. We greeted each other with a hug like we always do but this time it felt different. I knew he knew lol.\n\nWe sat down, made small talk, ordered our coffees… but neither of us brought up the obvious. The kiss... No one was addressing the elephant in the room lol..\n\nEventually, he said, “About the other night…” and I just sat up, nodded, and encouraged him to keep going. But he was dragging it out so I said it straight: “You drunk kissed me. And you told me you loved me. So... tell me about that.”\n\nHaha his cheeks were pink for a moment and I’ve never seen him so nervous before. He’s like “Yeah… I did and I meant it.” \n\nI asked him how long he’d liked me. He told me it was since I got my first boyfriend, two years ago. That he remembered not feeling happy for me, and that’s when it hit him. (This also checks out because they didn’t like each other and I never understood..) \n\nI just nodded, taking it all in, totally shocked but also flattered. I honestly didn’t think I was even a possibility to him. He said he didn’t mean to kiss me the other night but it just felt right, he couldn’t hold it in any longer and how the alcohol really helped.  \n\nSo I told him the truth. I liked the kiss and how it made me feel something I didn’t expect. I admitted I’ve never liked the girls hes had around, and deep down, it makes me feel insecure and how I thought I didn’t feel like I’d have a chance against them or even had a chance with him. And that’s why I never opened up my heart to the possibility of “us”. \n\nHe shook his head and got up and sat next to me putting his arm around me. And told me how silly I am and then said he loves me, and that if I gave him a chance, it would just be us and he would never give me a reason to ever feel that way again. \n\nHe said that in the past two years, he hasn’t felt a real spark with anyone he’s dated. None of them compared. He said he’d be more than satisfied with just me and that he’d do everything he can to make me happy.\n\nAt that point, I was overwhelmed and realise how fucking stupid Ive been. I teared up and just nodded. And then he said something that made me laugh “can we skip everything and just be girlfriend and boyfriend already?”\n\nI said yes. We hugged. And now I have a boyfriend who is my best friend! \n\nIt happened so fast, I still feel like I’m dreaming. It does not feel real at all. I’m still processing this whole week. \n\nAND when he took me home we shared a sober kiss and it was better than the first one. \n\nThank you to everyone who stopped me from brushing this off or walking away from something real. I was so insecure, convinced I didn’t have a chance, afraid of rejection. But reading your encouragement and your success stories helped more than you know.\n\nThank you, Reddit.\n\nTldr. We spoke about the drunken kiss realised he likes me just as much as I like him. Now we are together. ",

She did not feel the same way and we remained friends. I felt very at ease around her because I wasnt bottling up how I felt. She was super cool, we hung out at my place and her place and elsewhere and I never brought it up again. Our friendship endured and we gave each other advice about the opposite sex and shared stories,  it was wonderful. Looking back, imagine the regret I'd have if I wondered if she felt the same?

Other like unprompted little gifts\n\nAbove all make sure he knows you are the one person he can reveal his fears, worries and hopes. There are an amazing amount of boyfriends, fathers and husbands who are either afraid, unwilling or don’t want to worry their loved ones by doing something as simple as crying in front of them\n\nIf he is the one, if you build a life together you will face tough times but I can tell you will be each others strength. \n\nAlways mean what you say and say what you mean. \n\nI’m happy for you. Everyone deserves love and to be transformed by love. \n\nRespect him and make sure he respects you. \n\nAbove all maybe one day someone who is unsure needs advice.

        "text": "I was with my wife and kids at the grocery store. We went checkout at an actual register, which we normally wouldn't do, we perfer self checkout. The cashier was a young woman in her early 20's. She seemed distracted when I walked up, so I asked if her lane was open. She gave me an almost annoyed \"yeah\" without looking up, so we started putting the groceries on the belt. I made some small talk with her to break what seemed to be some to be some tension. She gave me short, dismissive replies until she looked up, and then her demeanor changed. She was suddenly talkative and engaging. I made a couple little jokes and she laughed, admittedly more than I would expect from a random cashier. I finished the transaction, went to pay, and she stumbled and stuttered over saying the total. She started giggling and apologized saying, \"I'm sorry, you're just such a nice and cute guy.\" I was surprised by that and just told her, \"well, thank you\" in response.\n\nAs we walked out, me wife said, \"wow, she was flirting with you like crazy.\" I just brushed it responding with something like, \"yeah, I guess.\" \n\nIt was honestly flattering though. I don't often get flirted with. Especially from attractive college age women. ",

I started feeling pleasure and electrifying sensations and i orgasmed and was pushing back to his yk part and then at one point i realized that it was just me thrusting back &amp;’ arching myself,  all he did was stay in the same position he was in and he called me a sl*t for it, and ever since that day i stopped talking to him and we broke up. \n \nI never told anyone and ive always hated my body for it thats why i never watched p*rn or masturbated on my own. Last night i finally built the courage to change that. I would always fight the urge to play with myself because it felt wrong &amp;’ would get flashbacks. I think i feel ready to take control of my body now &amp;’ move past it. ",

          "text": "First, good for you for taking control and not letting this trauma own you.\n\nFeeling like your body betrayed you is very, very common during/after rape. Victims often report that their bodie's orgasmed against their wishes. It's still rape even if you body responds. \n\nNo-one really knows why your body responded this way to assault - but you're not alone. The pleasure and fear response areas of your brain are close and some speculate this is the result of mixed wiring. Others suggest this is an evolved response to prevent damage or death from the encounter. The important thing is to understand that this is common and normal and not your fault and in no way did you consent.\n\nYou should also seek help - don't just bottle this up. Speak to a therapist, tell your friends, don't try to go this alone.\n\nGood luck to you and I hope your ex-BF ends up in jail - then let''s see how he enjoys being raped.",

Its hard to wrap your head around i get it.. when my ex did stuff I hated literally hated my body would still respond and he would justify his behaviour ignored the Nos and the harsh conversations because secretly I liked it.. no I didn't.

Since our kids were adults, we didn't have much of a relationship although we were friendly. \n\nI'm not sure what it was but I felt the need to reach out to him to let him know that I have no ill feelings towards him and I always thought he was a good dad and I was lucky to have him as the father of my kids. I said that I'd tell him that when we next saw each other. \n\nI didn't get the chance because he died last month of a massive heart attack. It was shocking because he was tall, slim and very active. My oldest son wants to take over the dad role because he doesn't want his 8yo brother growing up without a dad.\n\nI took a couple of days off work and came back yesterday. I was emotional thinking about my ex. I had to pull over for 30 minutes to cry. I got through two hours of work before leaving. I've been crying all day. I even vomited and had a nose bleed. I'm really sad that I didn't get to tell him what I wanted to tell him. ",
